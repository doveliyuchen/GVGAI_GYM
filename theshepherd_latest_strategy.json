  "implementation_guidance": "1. Prioritize collecting treats to increase the number of available dog treats. 2. Use treats to convert hungry dogs into helpful dogs. 3. Position helpful dogs to chase scared sheep towards entry points. 4. Guide scared sheep towards entry points by positioning the avatar to block escape routes. 5. Repeat the process until all sheep are tamed.",
  "long_term_plan": [
    "Step 1: Move the avatar to collect the nearby treat (positioned at (2,2)).",
    "Step 2: Position the avatar to shoot the treat towards the hungry dog (positioned at (4,12)).",
    "Step 3: After the dog becomes helpful, move the avatar to block the scared sheep (positioned at (4,1)) from moving away from the entry point (positioned at (1,13)).",
    "Step 4: Allow the helpful dog to chase the scared sheep towards the entry point.",
    "Step 5: Once the scared sheep is tamed, move the avatar to the next scared sheep (positioned at (2,5)).",
    "Step 6: Collect another treat if available or wait for the dog to revert to a hungry state.",
    "Step 7: Repeat the process of converting the dog and herding the sheep towards the entry point.",
    "Step 8: Continue this strategy for all scared sheep in the level.",
    "Step 9: Monitor the positions of the sheep and dogs to ensure efficient herding.",
    "Step 10: Adjust positioning as needed to account for sheep movement and obstacles."

  "anticipated_challenges": [
    "Scared sheep may move unpredictably, making it difficult to herd them towards entry points.",
    "Limited number of treats may restrict the ability to convert dogs frequently.",
    "Obstacles like fences and doors may block the path of sheep or the avatar.",
    "Helpful dogs may not always chase sheep in the desired direction."
  ],
  "success_metrics": [
    "Number of scared sheep successfully tamed.",
    "Efficiency in using treats to convert dogs.",
    "Time taken to tame all sheep."
  ],
  "fallback_strategy": "WaitnSee",
  "reasoning": "The current level has several scared sheep and a hungry dog. By converting the dog into a helpful state, we can leverage its chasing behavior to herd the sheep towards entry points. This strategy maximizes the use of game mechanics (dog transformations and sheep herding) to achieve the objective efficiently.",
  "new_insights": [
    "Dogs can be strategically used to automate the herding process.",
    "Positioning the avatar to block escape routes can enhance herding efficiency.",
    "Treats are a limited resource and should be used judiciously."
