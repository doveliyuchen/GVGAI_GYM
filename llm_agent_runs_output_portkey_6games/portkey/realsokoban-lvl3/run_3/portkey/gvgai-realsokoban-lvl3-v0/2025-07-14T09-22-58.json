In a typical push\u2010puzzle we would want to push the box upward so that it lands on the hole and transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d (which no longer counts as a box). However, to push a box upward the avatar must be positioned below it so that when moving UP the box is nudged northward. In our current state the only cell below the box would be (3,1) and that cell is a wall ($); there is no accessible cell from where we can push upward. \n\nSince we currently cannot push the box directly into the hole, we need to reposition our avatar for a better approach. A good first step is to start by moving UP to (1,2) (a floor cell) so that we may explore alternate approaches (for example, checking if we can later access a position that might allow a \u201cbounceForward\u201d or an indirect maneuver). \n\nAction:4\n\nI expect that by moving up, we will have a new view of the board that may allow us to devise a plan to safely push the box into the hole (or rely on the undo mechanic if we run into a chain reaction)."
