Therefore, it is crucial to take a meaningful action to reposition effectively or to engage with enemy threats.\n\n### Action Plan\nSince the avatar is currently at a relatively safe position but is further away from the threatening alien entities, it is strategic to move left or right to better position itself to either attack enemies or retreat if necessary. \n\nChoosing to move **left** will allow the avatar to explore any potential threats or spawn points on the left side of the map and to better position itself against any future alien spawns.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should help in gaining strategic positioning while adhering to the strategy of remaining mobile and maintaining awareness of enemy threats."
