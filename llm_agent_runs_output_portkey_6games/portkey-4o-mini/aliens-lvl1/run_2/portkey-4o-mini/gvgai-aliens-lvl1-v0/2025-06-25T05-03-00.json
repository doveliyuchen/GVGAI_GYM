The avatar needs to have maneuverability.\n2. **Targeting**: Focusing on defeating aliens with the \"sam\" shots is also critical, but currently, there are no immediate aliens in sight that can be targeted directly from the current position.\n\n### Next Action:\nGiven that the position of the avatar has not changed, I will perform an ACTION_RIGHT to move one step horizontally to the right. This will help create space for maneuvering and potentially avoid any future threats while keeping aligned with the game strategy.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this move to provide a strategic advantage by allowing me more room to dodge any incoming threats from the above rows."

Given the avatar is currently at row 10 and can move left or right, let's analyze the state:\n\n1. **Positioning:** The avatar is relatively safe but needs to watch for any potential threats from above. No immediate threats are visible in the immediate vertical column (col 1).\n\n2. **Target Selection:** The nearest aliens are positioned at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 7), etc., but they are not directly targeting the avatar.\n\n3. **Movement:** Moving left to (10, 0) keeps a safe angle since no aliens are in direct horizontal or vertical alignment, but this does not allow for shooting.\n\n4. **Action Usage:** There are no bombs or immediate threats currently, but as part of practicing caution, staying away from the left edge where possible threats could appear allows greater mobility.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's take the action to move left to assess the situation further while maintaining a safe position.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will allow me to reposition and better assess the threat levels for future strategy while avoiding potential damage from above."

Your avatar is at the bottom of the screen, and there are no immediate threats directly above. However, you need to be aware of alien movements and bomb locations.\n2. The nearest aliens are spread out, with many potentially able to reach your area if they move without being destroyed.\n\n### Strategy Application:\n- **Positioning**: Since you are already at the bottom, there isn't a need to move down. Instead, let's consider moving right to potentially engage and shoot any approaching aliens.\n- **Targeting**: Your main objective is to engage the aliens while avoiding any penalties from the bombs.\n\nSince your avatar has not moved and given that there are enemies to potentially engage with above, I would suggest moving to the right to create more opportunities for targeting enemies while also maintaining a safe position.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving right is strategic as it may allow engagement with aliens while avoiding direct threats from bombs above."
