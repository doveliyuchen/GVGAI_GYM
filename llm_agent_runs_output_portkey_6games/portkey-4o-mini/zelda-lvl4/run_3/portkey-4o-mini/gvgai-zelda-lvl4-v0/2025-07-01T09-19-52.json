The layout suggests the key is potentially near `m` at (7, 6).\n2. **Avoiding Enemies**: The enemy (`%`) at (7, 11) can pose a threat and should be avoided until I can better arm myself or assess its movement pattern.\n3. **Path to Goal**: The goal is at (1, 10), but I must not approach without the key; thus, I should prioritize the key first.\n\n### Next Action\nSince we don't have the avatar's position specified, I will analyze the surrounding states and select an action that moves towards the key identified above while avoiding enemies.\n\nAssuming the avatar is in a position that allows movement downward, I will opt to move downwards (to line 6 if I am currently on line 5). \n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action is strategic because it leads towards the key's area while ensuring I stay aware of possible enemy encounters.

The starting position is not specified, but observing the map shows that moving down from potential starting positions is necessary.\n\n### Analyzing Position\nMoving downward from a more central location is ideal, as immediate paths seem clear at the first row of coordinates.

The nearby enemies (the quick monster '%' at (1, 11) and normal monster '$' at (1, 2)) could pose threats during movement, particularly since the quick monster seems very close to the goal.\n\nGiven these factors, the initial strategy should focus on moving towards the key while navigating potential enemy movements. \n\nSince the avatar presumably starts off nearby without a clear position, let's move Down (ACTION_DOWN) which would typically signify the avatar will begin navigating the lower area, where the key is located.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to facilitate progress towards acquiring the key, which is vital for later success in reaching the goal."
