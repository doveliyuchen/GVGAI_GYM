The combat encounters with enemies should be avoided since engaging them is risky without a key and could lead to losing score.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- Move left to (7, 3): This is a free floor (.)\n- Move right to (7, 5): This space is a wall (w).\n- Move down to (8, 4): This is a wall (w).\n- Move up to (6, 4): This is a wall (w).\n- Use the key (NUMEROUS): This option should be used once a key is obtained.\n\nGiven the clear path to the key, the next action should be to move right towards the key directly.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect to collect the key and thus transform from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\", enabling further interactions to access the goal and plan the next moves accordingly."

This is crucial because the avatar is currently in a state of 'nokey', meaning it can\u2019t interact with the goal located at (row=1, col=10) until it collects a key.\n3. **Enemies**: There are two enemies present: `$` (normal monster) located at (row=5, col=1) and (row=7, col=2), which we need to avoid. \n\n### Action Plan\nSince the avatar is currently in the (1, 1) position and aims to move towards (7, 6) to collect the key, the next logical step is to move downwards since we\u2019re two rows above the desired key row.\n\n### Proposed Action\n1.

If facing left (the only clear space without walls), I can move towards it directly.\n2. I must be cautious of the nearby enemies horizontally adjacent to trees.\n\n### Action Selection\n- Let's proceed to **Action Down (4)** toward the key, as it is a direct move towards the goal of collecting the key.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will help me access the key and engage in further strategic possibilities for victory. I expect my avatar will move closer to the key while remaining conscious of enemy movements."
