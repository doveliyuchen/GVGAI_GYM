Here's the breakdown of the layout with key observations: \n\n- **Key** (`#`) is located at (4,1).\n- **Goal** (`@`) is located at (7,11).\n- Enemies include:\n  - Normal monster (`$`) at (2,1)\n  - Quick monster (`%`) at (4,3)\n  - Slow monster (`&`) at (6,1)\n- `*` indicates the avatar currently has no key and is in a vulnerable state (it can be hit).\n\n### Current Strategy\n1. **Key Collection**: Since it's essential to collect the key available at (4,1), I should prioritize reaching it.\n2. **Avoid Enemies**: I need to navigate carefully to avoid the enemy and interact with the key.\n3. **Turn and Move**: Given the planned movements to collect the key, I first need to turn to face right (moving from column 1 to 2).\n\n### Action Decision\nBased on the analysis, I will first attempt to move right towards column 1.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should effectively rotate the avatar and then move it towards the key position, aligning closely with the overall strategy of prioritizing key collection."

There is a key represented by '#' at the position (4,1). The most direct action would be to move towards the right to reach the key.\n\nGiven the layout, my initial position (7, 1) allows me to move directly up or right, but moving up does not change my position favorably since there are walls. Since my objective is to obtain the key at (4,1), I intend to move down which will keep my path open toward the key subsequently.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action will move me downward and bring me closer to the key, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing key collection as it is essential to unlocking the goal. I expect to see my avatar positioned to eventually access the key on the next move."

In the current state, we need to carefully plan our movement to collect keys and reach the goals while avoiding enemies.\n\n1. The location of the avatar (which we haven\u2019t been given) is essential to determine the action.\n2. In the vicinity, there is one key at (4, 1) and one goal at (7, 11).\n3. There are some enemies present, specifically a monsterSlow ('&') at (6, 1) and a monsterQuick ('%') at (6, 3).\n\nOnce the avatar's position is known, we can determine the best available action. If we're starting from a position, our first step should either be to navigate toward the key or avoid enemies based on the avatar's current health state.\n\nGiven that keys are important for unlocking goals (represented by '@'), let's say the avatar starts from (7, 2), which is adjacent to the key at (4, 1). The first action should be to navigate towards the key for collection.\n\nAssuming the avatar is at (7, 2):\n1. Move Up once (to (6, 2)) \u2014 this square is unobstructed and close to the key.\n\nTherefore, the action taken will be:\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action should move the avatar upward towards (6, 2), aligning with the strategy of collecting the key."

We need to move upwards since the key is above the avatar's current position. The immediate plan will be to move sequentially upward along the column until we reach row 4:\n\n1. **Move Upward** to (6, 1).\n2. The following action will keep moving upward to (5, 1).\n3. Continue upward again to (4, 1), where the key is located.\n\nThe first action will be:\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action attempts to move the avatar upward toward the key. My expectation is that by moving up, I will get closer to the key and ultimately collect it, allowing my avatar to transition from nokey to withkey. This aligns perfectly with our strategy of prioritizing key collection."
