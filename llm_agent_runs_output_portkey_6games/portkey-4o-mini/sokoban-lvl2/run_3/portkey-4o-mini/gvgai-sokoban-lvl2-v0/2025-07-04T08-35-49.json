However, since the wall is on the left (column 6) and at that position, it will not allow for further manipulation of the boxes in the next round.\n\nGiven the current needs to push the box at (row=2, col=9) into the hole at (row=7, col=9), the action I should take is:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will attempt to move the avatar left to (row=7, col=7), allowing for repositioning in future actions to either move down or position for pushing boxes. This aligns with the strategy of planning moves to access boxes for elimination."

You can move right to (row=3, col=3), which is an empty space that will allow you to comfortably position yourself without any obstruction.\n3. Moving down to (row=4, col=2) or up to (row=2, col=2) also does not lead to any productive movement, since those spaces are either empty or do not get you closer to the goal.\n\nTherefore, the most strategic move right now is to move **right** to (row=3, col=3). This positions you optimally to interact with the box later while maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this movement will help me navigate towards the box and plan my next move for eliminating one of the boxes into a hole."

Notably, there is one box that can be influenced by the avatar\u2019s movement.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions\n- **Moving Left (to (3, 1))**: This would bring the avatar directly into contact with the box, allowing for interaction. The box can then potentially be moved into a hole.\n- **Moving Right (to (3, 3))**: This would not interact with the box and would just move into an empty space. Not meaningful for the objective.\n- **Moving Up (to (2, 2))**: This would not interact with the box either, and the space is a wall.\n- **Moving Down (to (4, 2))**: Again, this would keep the avatar in an empty space without interacting with the box.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most strategic action is to move left to (3, 1), where the box is located. Then, if we can interact with the box effectively, we can push it into the hole at (2, 3) on subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to interact with the box, and my expectation is to push the box towards the hole in the next turn."

Moving Up to (row 4, col 3) will not directly help eliminate any boxes but will allow gateways for future moves.\n2. Moving Down to (row 6, col 3) keeps us in an open area but still limits options.\n3. Moving Left to (row 5, col 2) opens up another path.\n4. Moving Right to (row 5, col 4) offers another free space.\n\n### Decision:\nSince moving up (to row 4, col 3) will allow for more strategic positioning by getting closer to potential box positions, I choose to take action there.\n\n```Action: 4```\nMoving up will provide better control for future moves toward eliminating boxes while taking advantage of open space."

There are two boxes ('@') present on the grid at positions (row 3, col 1) and (row 2, col 9) and I need to eliminate them by pushing them into the holes ('0'), which are located at (row 2, col 3) and (row 4, col 5) respectively.\n\nGiven the layout, my immediate goal is to maneuver the boxes towards the holes while avoiding deadlocks. Moving left or right does not seem viable due to walls surrounding columns 0 and 10. I can move down towards (row 6, col 3), where there is an empty floor space.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move will take my avatar down, allowing me to explore options to eventually move towards the boxes. My expectation is to create a better opportunity for maneuvering towards the boxes without risking getting stuck against walls."
