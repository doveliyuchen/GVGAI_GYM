You need to prioritize moving boxes into the holes.\n2. The box at (4, 5) is already on a hole, meaning you can score by simply removing it from the game by pushing it into the hole.\n3. The box at (3, 4) can potentially be pushed into the hole at (2, 3).\n4. The box at (2, 4) can be moved next since it only requires one step towards the hole.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. If you go **down** (Action 3), you'll move to (8, 9), which doesn't help as there are no boxes or holes there.\n2. If you go **left** (Action 1), you'll end up in (7, 8), but there are still walls blocking further movements.\n3. If you go **right** (Action 2), you'll stay at (7, 9).\n4. If you go **up** (Action 4), you'll move to (6, 9), which also doesn't help as there are no interactions possible.\n\nGiven the current layout and need to move a box towards a hole or make a significant interaction, the best course of action would be to move **up** (Action 4) and then find a way to go left in the next turn to be able to push towards the box at (3, 4).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is intended to find a new position that opens up further options for interaction with the boxes, ultimately moving closer to putting them in the holes."

Since moving left, right, up, or down doesn\u2019t allow the avatar to interact directly with any boxes, it's essential to revise the plan. Since the avatar is currently stuck without valid movement options towards a box, we should reconsider our choice and possibly implement a strategic plan to reposition the avatar for future interactions.\n\nGiven the current layout, I will opt for **no movements for now**.

Move **right** to (7, 9) - but this will not allow pushing as there is an empty hole (and the avatar will enter the hole).\n3. Move **up** to (6, 8) - this leads into an empty spot.\n4.

The objective is to move boxes towards the holes, focusing on those closest to the avatar.\n\n### Immediate Next Steps\nTo progress, we can consider moving left or down because:\n- Moving **DOWN** to (row=8, col=6) is safe and won\u2019t run into walls.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (row=7, col=5) would not directly achieve our goal either, but keeps options open.\n\n### Choice of Action\nMoving down seems more productive as it adds flexibility and allows the avatar to explore a new area below. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is that moving down will open further opportunities to reposition the avatar for future moves towards the boxes and holes."

The hole at (row=2, col=3) is one box away (from (row=2, col=4)).\n2. The hole at (row=4, col=5) is aligned with the box at (row=3, col=4).\n3. The hole at (row=7, col=9) is near the box at (row=2, col=9) but two rows up.\n\nOne immediate action could be to move the avatar closer to the boxes or the holes.\n\n### Selection of Action\nGiven the avatar's current position and the potential moves to enable further box manipulation:\n- **Moving Right to (row=7, col=6)** would no longer block potential interactions with the boxes and allows for future moves towards the box at (row=2, col=4) or towards hole (row=7, col=9).\n\nTherefore, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is strategic as it positions the avatar for better future interactions with the boxes without causing unnecessary blockage."

Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Evaluate Immediate Moves**: The avatar can move UP (`row=6, col=6`), DOWN (`row=8, col=6`), LEFT (`row=7, col=5`), or RIGHT (`row=7, col=7`).\n   \n2. **Assess Box Movement**: \n   - The nearest hole for our avatar at `(row=7, col=6)` is at `(row=7, col=9)`. However, we don\u2019t have access to the boxes directly from this position unless we move.\n   - The hole at `(row=4, col=5)` can be accessed with several moves but requires careful positioning of the boxes first.\n\n### Choosing the Next Action\n1. We can move UP to `(row=6, col=6)` to explore the top area.\n2. Moving LEFT or RIGHT won't yield an immediate box push as there aren't any boxes directly to manipulate from our current position.\n\nGiven the need to reposition and explore viable strategies to access box movement, **moving UP seems prudent**. This maintains potential avenues to manipulate boxes effectively on the next moves.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving UP will allow us to assess further actions from a higher perspective and potentially gain access to maneuver boxes next turn."

Move right to (6, 4): This space is free and might allow manipulation closer to the box at (2, 4).\n2. Move left to (6, 2): This is also free but may not lead to a significant change in strategy.\n3.
