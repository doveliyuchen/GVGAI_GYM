Hole at (2, 3) directly next to the box at (2, 4)\n2. Hole at (4, 5) that can be reached if the box at (3, 4) is moved correctly.\n3. Hole at (7, 9) that can be reached from boxes on row 2, movement needs to be planned.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nSince the avatar is at (6, 3) and can rotate to any adjacent position but cannot cross walls, the immediate next move consideration should be to access the box at (2, 4) to push it into the hole at (2, 3).\n\n### Action Planning:\n1. **Action UP**: Move the avatar to (5, 3) (which would still keep it in proximity to the box).\n2. **Action UP**: Move again to (4, 3) still close but does not resolve the current layout.\n3. **Action UP again**: Would be needed to navigate upward to access those boxes.\n4. From this point (after a few UP actions), then push the box in the row above.\n\n### Conclusion:\nHowever, the most direct and actionable move right now would be to focus on bringing boxes down to their designated holes rather than continually moving UP. Because a direct move toward the box seems less feasible from (6, 3), there's no immediate action available to win from this position like pushing boxes to holes.\n\n#### So based on this analysis, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis will move up to (5, 3) and potentially allow access to other moves next to position more adequately to box or holes.\n\nBy taking this action, the anticipation is to pivot towards boxes that lead to the holes directly or open further moves for the boxes while checking potential of traps with walls."

Moving the avatar **up** to (6,3) is necessary, as it opens the potential for future interactions with the boxes:\n   - **Moving up** gets us closer to accessing the upper row where more boxes are situated and approach toward a box that can be pushed into the nearest hole at (4,5) from (3,4).\n\n``` \nAction:4\n```\nI expect this action to maintain the trajectory towards reaching and possibly moving the boxes into holes in future moves."

The holes are a key target for disposing of boxes.\n2. The avatar needs to navigate around walls to reach the boxes and push them into the holes.\n3. The wall blocks the left and top paths directly around the avatar, making down or right movement the most promising initial options.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Push Boxes Towards Holes**: The immediate goal should be to manipulate the boxes so that they can be moved into the holes.\n2. **Maximize Moves**: It is crucial to think about the direction in which to push boxes while keeping the layout consideration to plan ahead.\n\n### Current Consideration:\n- The most straightforward approach is to consider moving down or right from (7, 5). Moving down to (8, 5) would only encounter walls, therefore not advancing the strategy.\n- Moving right to (7, 6) might also be a good initial move as it opens up further movement options later.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will take the action to move RIGHT:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right may allow for the next better strategic options opening up the ability to maneuver around obstacles."

Up (to (4, 4)) - Blocked by a wall.\n2. Down (to (6, 4)) - Open to move down to an empty space.\n3. Left (to (5, 3)) - Open to move left to an empty space.\n4.

The nearest box is at (3, 1). Moving the avatar UP will allow us to push the box into the hole once we reach it.\n2. The next steps will depend on the box's movement and the locations of holes.\n\n### Determining the Action\nSince the current action has not resulted in any movement (the avatar remains at (3, 2)), a meaningful action is to move UP to push the box at (3, 1).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should allow my avatar to push the box above it, bringing us closer to the win by potentially placing boxes into holes and scoring points."

If the avatar moves here, it will not utilize the box immediately but will occupy the hole.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move to (2, 5).

Here\u2019s a strategic breakdown of actions available to maximize moving towards the goal of removing all boxes into holes (0).\n\n### Current Analysis:\n- The avatar is positioned in a relatively open area with boxes nearby.\n- There are holes located at `(4, 5)` and `(7, 9)`.\n- The immediate goal is to push boxes towards these holes while avoiding getting blocked by walls.\n\nGiven that the avatar has just been evaluated, and since it is crucial to have a prior position to determine if it actually moved, I will consider actions that strategically push one of the nearby boxes.\n\n### Possible Steps:\n1. The box at `(2, 5)` can be pushed by the avatar in the right direction.\n2. Pushing this box to `(2, 6)` (which is a wall) would not allow it, so the only direction we can move towards a box is to leave the current vertical position and push a box.\n\n### Intended Action:\n- **Move Right (to push the box at `(2, 5)` to `(2, 6)`)**: This action will not result in a movement directly due to walls surrounding the area. Thus, we will have to analyze further.\n\n### Actual Action Selection:\nInstead, I will select the option to move **Left** where the avatar can push `@` from `(3, 1)`. The hole is nearby; hence continuing through the boxes strategically towards the holes is a better way.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action means moving left and potentially reorienting the avatar towards where effective movement can occur towards the goal, anticipating the next strategic scenario."

The next hole is at (4, 5), directly below the box at (2, 5). \n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Push the box at (2, 5)**: Moving down from (2, 3) to (2, 5) will allow you to push the box down into the hole at (4, 5).\n  \nSince moving to the right (action 2) or left (action 1) does not result in any box manipulation nor does up (action 4), the best move is going down (action 3) which will allow you to push the adjacent box down afterward.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should reposition the avatar to push the box into the hole below, aligning with the strategy of maximizing movement efficiency and utilizing holes effectively."

Moving left can set up a future box movement. After careful consideration, a more fruitful strategy will be moving right to position the avatar in an area where it can potentially push the box at (2, 5) into the hole in successive moves.\n\n### Decision:\nGoing right will not only keep the avatar active but also open further opportunities to manipulate the boxes positioned in (2, 5) and (2, 9).\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action positions the avatar strategically for future moves and keeps options open to push boxes towards the holes efficiently."

The avatar can only push boxes that are adjacent to it and must avoid walls ('w'). \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n- The box at (2, 5) is currently placed adjacent to the avatar's position at (3, 2).\n- The holes at (2, 3) and (4, 5) are crucial targets to dispose of the boxes.\n\nSince our avatar is in a position to push one of the boxes at (3, 1) to the left, our objective should be to move and push boxes strategically into the nearest holes.\n\nNow, checking the available actions:\n1. Moving Left from (3, 2) to (3, 1) will allow us to push the box at (3, 1) right afterward.\n2. After that, we can aim to push the box from (3, 1) into the hole at (4, 5) or (2, 3) for maximum points while following the win condition.\n\nWith consideration for all mechanics and the objective to maximize movement towards holes and push boxes without getting stuck, this leads us to take the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action intends to move the avatar left to position (3, 1), setting the stage to act upon the box next turn and potentially achieving a box disposal into the hole shortly thereafter."
