Observing the map:\n\n- Up (to (5, 3)) is possible (but it\u2019s an empty space).\n- Down (to (7, 3)) is also possible (and empty).\n- Left (to (6, 2)) is possible (and empty).\n- Right (to (6, 4)) results in a wall.\n\nFor now, the game strategy dictates that I should avoid pushing any boxes until I review the layout more systematically. It may be best to explore above or below my current position to position myself better for future box movements.\n\nSince moving up to (5, 3) gives me more space to strategize around the boxes, I will choose that action.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should help me assess new options for box movements and continue working toward my objective of clearing the boxes effectively."

Particularly, because I need to think about pushing the boxes, the left and down movements could also provide opportunities to position myself effectively.\n\nGiven the situation, for this turn, I will choose to move **left (7, 4)** since it keeps several options open for manipulating the boxes above afterwards. \n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action will position the avatar next to a space with a box above, allowing strategic moves in the next turn to work towards removing boxes efficiently."

Currently, pushing the box at (2, 5) into the hole at (4, 5) seems direct but will require navigating around walls. \n\nIn this case:\n\n1. The first relevant action could be to push the box at (2, 5) down towards the hole at (4, 5). \n2. The avatar could move down (to position (4, 5)) and then push the box into the hole.\n\nHowever, the avatar needs to move first to a position where it can push the box appropriately. \n\nLet's take a step back and move the avatar down to position (4, 5) first, setting it up to push the box.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action moves the avatar down.

Since moving left leads to another wall and does not offer any effective strategy, moving right to (7,4) is possible. However, (7,4) is a wall, and thus the appropriate move from (7,3) might be to go up (to row 6, col 3).\n\nLet's proceed with moving **UP** to (6,3), as it opens up the path and may allow further exploration towards manipulating nearby boxes.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \nI expect this action will allow more maneuverability towards the open spaces and boxes, aligning with the strategy of strategically pushing boxes towards holes."
