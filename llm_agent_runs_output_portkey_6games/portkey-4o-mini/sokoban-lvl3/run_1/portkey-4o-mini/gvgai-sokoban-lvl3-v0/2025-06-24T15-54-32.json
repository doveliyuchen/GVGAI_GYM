The goal is to remove all the boxes by pushing them into the holes, utilizing the bouncing mechanic effectively to navigate around walls.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. The avatar can interact with the boxes by approaching them and pushing them.\n2. Boxes can be pushed towards the holes for removal.\n3. We need to ensure that our avatar\u2019s position allows for successful movements without hitting walls.\n\n### Next Steps:\nFrom the current position (4, 4), the avatar can move left towards (4, 3), where there's a box. This will initiate the box-pushing mechanic. \n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left is essential to push the box at (4, 3) into the hole at (4, 1) while avoiding any deadlocks with walls. I expect that this will successfully position the avatar to push the box towards an imminent removal in future turns."
