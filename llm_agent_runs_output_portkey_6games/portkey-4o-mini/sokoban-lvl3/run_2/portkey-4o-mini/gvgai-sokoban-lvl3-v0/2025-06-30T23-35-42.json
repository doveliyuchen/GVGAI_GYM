The avatar is surrounded by an open area with walls blocking movement on various sides.\n2. One box is directly above the avatar (at (5, 2)), and one box is to the right (at (4, 4)).\n3. The objective is to eliminate all boxes, and pushing them into the holes is necessary for achieving this.\n4. There is currently no danger of pushing a box into a wall as all potential moves towards walls can be avoided.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nThe most strategic move would be to push the box at (4, 4) into one of the holes if a route could allow that. However, since the box (4, 4) cannot be pushed to a hole right now, the next step is to reposition to a favorable spot to push boxes.\n\nBased on the current setup and the layout:\n- The box at (5, 2) can be pushed upward, but first, I should navigate the avatar to push the box at (4, 4) into a more favorable position.\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe best action is to **move downwards (ACTION_DOWN)** to (5, 2), where the box is located. This can enable future movement with a potential outcome of pushing the boxes either upwards or positioning them for holes.\n\n### Action Execution:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action relocates the avatar to facilitate an upcoming move to push boxes more effectively. I expect that by doing this, I will have options available for manipulating box positions in the next turn."

There are no explicit movement restrictions aside from walls blocking the path.\n\n### Best Next Move\nThe strategy suggests planning moves wisely while considering wall placements and the current position of the avatar. The immediate action needs to focus on how to push boxes towards the holes without getting blocked.\n\n1. The avatar can only push boxes, so a good strategy is to first evaluate nearby boxes for potential movement.\n2. The box at (4, 4) can be pushed into (4, 3) since the avatar is adjacent to it.\n3. Pushing the box from (4, 4) to (4, 3) will not eliminate it immediately but allows optimal positioning for future moves.\n\nGiven this, the next logical move is to push the box at (4, 4) towards the box at (3, 5) to create a chain reaction:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nI expect that this move will help align the boxes closer to the holes, setting up for potential future placements into the holes, in line with the suggested strategy."

The immediate strategy should be to explore nearby spaces while considering walls and holes, and looking to push boxes towards holes to effectively reduce the box count.\n\n### Key Positions:\n- **Avatar Position**: (4, 1)\n- **Nearby Boxes**: \n  - (4, 4)\n  - (5, 2)\n- **Holes**:\n  - (1, 3)\n  - (2, 3)\n\n### Strategy Application:\n1. The avatar can move down to (5, 1) or to the right (4, 2).\n2. Moving right to (4, 2) would place the avatar next to a box at (4, 4). \n3. Moving down to (5, 1) does not provide immediate access to a box.\n4. Given that there is a box at (4, 4), pushing that box into the hole at (1, 3) would be a long-term goal, but we need to plan the steps to get there.\n\nSince moving right (to (4, 2)) allows for a follow-up action to push the box at (4, 4) if the avatar is successfully moved there, I will choose that.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to (4, 2) keeps all options open and positions the avatar closer to the boxes. This aligns with the strategy of optimizing box handling."
