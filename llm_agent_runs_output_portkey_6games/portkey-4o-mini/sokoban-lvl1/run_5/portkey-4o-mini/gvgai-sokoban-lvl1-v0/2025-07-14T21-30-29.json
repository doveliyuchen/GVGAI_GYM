Instead, it may set you up for the next action toward your right (to `(5, 3)` where the approach to the box `(5, 0)` can happen next). \n\nThus, I will choose to move `LEFT`:\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\nThis action should provide me with a chance to better position for the next strategic move and explore available options around the boxes nearby."

Given the avatar's current position, it appears to have easy access to the box at (5, 1) and (5, 8).\n4. The holes are positioned at (3, 5) and (6, 3), which suggests strategic moves need to consider the most efficient path toward these holes while handling the boxes properly.\n\n### Movement Analysis\nThe avatar can move left, right, up, or down but needs to be aware of the possible interactions with the boxes and walls. Moving left (to (5, 2)) might take the avatar away from optimal action as there are no boxes nearby in this direction and primarily leads into floor space.\n\n**Next Action**\nTo take meaningful action towards winning the game, I will direct the avatar to interact with the box at (5, 1) by moving left to (5, 2) first. This movement keeps our options open, as the box will then still be available for interaction in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this action will allow a better strategic position to then move the box subsequently, following our established strategy of grouping boxes for easier manipulation."

Since the avatar can move left to (5, 1), it will collide with the box and apply a bouncing effect that will push the box towards the left.

Currently, we have the boxes arranged with some proximity to holes.\n\n### Possible Actions\nThe avatar can move in four directions but needs to focus on moving in such a way that assists in getting the boxes to the holes.\n\n1. **Evaluate**: Moving left (to column 0) would not serve the purpose since it\u2019s a wall.\n2. **Moving Right** to (row=6, col=2) is not blocked and moves closer to the open area.\n3. **Moving Up** to (row=5, col=1) would keep the avatar in the same column without advancing on holes.\n4. **Moving Down** to (row=7, col=1) is also possible but moves further away from the operational area where most of the boxes are positioned.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\nGiven that the nearest box is at (row=5, col=1), **moving right** to (row=6, col=2) allows us to hover near more viable holes (both at (row=6, col=3) and (row=6, col=11)).\n\nTherefore, I will choose the action to move right. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action will bring the avatar closer to both the boxes and the holes, potentially allowing for an efficient strategy to move the boxes into holes on subsequent turns."

The avatar is adjacent to a box at (5, 1). Moving left would result in the avatar colliding with this box.\n2. Upon colliding with a box, the avatar will bounce forward into another position.\n3. To win, we need to strategically move the boxes into the holes while avoiding unnecessary losses.\n\n### Possible Actions\n- Moving **left (1)** would cause the avatar to collide with the box at (5, 1), causing it to bounce to (5, 0) (which is a wall), effectively keeping the avatar in the same row.\n- Moving **right (2)** would not be effective because it only leads to empty space.\n- Moving **down (3)** leads to an empty space, allowing us to create a possible maneuver.\n- Moving **up (4)** would also move upwards to (4, 2), which is also empty.\n\nConsidering the goal to manipulate the boxes and not cause any immediate losses, moving **down (3)** seems to create opportunities to move later since there are more open paths in the lower rows where more holes are located. \n\n### Conclusion\nI will choose to move **down (3)** since it keeps me away from sending any boxes into holes prematurely while progressing to more strategic positions.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows repositioning the avatar to explore further options without risking a box falling into a hole.

The objective is to move the boxes into the holes without running out of boxes. \n\nLet's review the potential actions:\n\n- **Moving Left (ACTION_LEFT)** to (5, 1):\n  - This position contains a box ('@'). The avatar will interact with the box and bounce to (5, 0) but will hit a wall ('w') and not move further. This allows for future strategic positioning relative to the box but doesn't immediately achieve the objective of moving a box into a hole.\n\n- **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (5, 3):\n  - This position is free ('.') and would allow the avatar to reposition away from the box at (5, 1). \n\n- **Moving Down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (6, 2):\n  - This position is free ('.') and would allow the avatar to reposition further towards the next hole and potentially plan for moving boxes.\n\n- **Moving Up (ACTION_UP)** to (4, 2):\n  - This position is free ('.'), allows the avatar to reposition upward, but may not lead to an immediate beneficial interaction without considering the future movements.\n\nGiven the choices, let's proceed to assess the best option. Moving down to (6, 2) opens up more possibilities toward the holes on the next turn. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action will allow for greater flexibility in the next move and also brings the avatar closer to the holes, aligning with the strategy of ensuring boxes can be manipulated toward those holes efficiently in the following moves."

The avatar can interact with the box at (5, 1) by moving left (5, 3), which allows it to rebound forward and potentially maneuver towards a hole. \n2. The hole directly below (6, 3) can be a target for the box at (5, 8), requiring movement over to the right.\n3.
