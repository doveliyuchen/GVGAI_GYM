Move Left to (6,5) -> This space is empty and will not directly help with box removal.\n2. Move Right to (6,7) -> This space is also empty.\n3. Move Up to (5,6) -> This space is empty as well.\n4. Move Down to (7,6) -> This space is empty. \n\nNone of these immediate moves will establish a direct interaction with the boxes. However, since I need to take significant action and my current position is unhelpful, I will consider a different approach to ensure the avatar does not stay stagnant.\n\nTherefore, I will move Left to (6,5). This may not advance towards moving boxes but is necessary to make a change in position.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action does not directly contribute to box elimination, but it alters my position and prepares for potential future moves.

No boxes are pushed and it does not create any immediate scoring move.\n4. **Up (ACTION_UP)**: This moves the avatar to (4, 6), where there is a box. However, bouncing from the box does not create a scoring move either.\n\n### Best Move Strategy:\nSince both lateral (left/right) moves do not yield progress, and moving downwards does not facilitate any box interactions, the more strategic movement lies in pushing the box located at (5, 8) into the hole at (6, 11).\n\nTo do this, we need to first move to (5, 8).

Move down (A_ACTION_DOWN) --> would result in (6, 6) which is floor '.' and doesn't help.\n4. Move up (A_ACTION_UP) --> would result in (4, 6) which is floor '.' but is limited in usefulness for now.\n\nSince the box at (row=5, col=8) needs to be moved to row=6 to reach any hole, I can attempt to push it.\n\nI will take the action of moving right to push the box at (row=5, col=8) to facilitate further actions towards completing the puzzle.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to push the box, aligning with the strategy of targeting the box to eventually push it into a hole.

The box at (row 7, col 11) can be pushed towards (row 6, col 11), which would mean pushing the box to get it closer to the hole at (row 6, col 3) or down to (row 5, col 11) later.\n2.

The hole at (row 3, col 5) is reachable from (row 2, col 4) with two moves vertically. However, we need to focus on boxes either closer to holes or that can be easily maneuvered.\n\n### Analyzing the Possible Actions:\nSince the avatar is currently at (7, 7), let's outline the possible action:\n\n- **Left (ACTION_LEFT) to (7, 6):** Potentially move towards the box closer to (row 7, col 11).\n- **Right (ACTION_RIGHT) to (7, 8):** No boxes exist there; this move might not be effective.\n- **Up (ACTION_UP) to (6, 7):** This position does not lead to a compelling action regarding removing boxes.\n- **Down (ACTION_DOWN) to (8, 7):** Similar to moving right; it won't facilitate achieving the objective.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nThe most promising immediate action that aligns with the strategy of maneuvering the boxes effectively involves moving to the left to ensure we can push the box at (7, 11) closer to a hole.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action is expected to set up further moves to effectively clear the nearby box in the subsequent turns."

Moving left to (7, 7) would move the avatar adjacent to the box and allow us to push it.\n\n### Recommended Action\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis move is expected to position the avatar closer to the box, enabling a potential push into an adjacent hole in the subsequent move.

The immediate moves available are:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3): This position is a floor (.), so it\u2019s valid to move.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 5): This position is also a floor (.), so it\u2019s valid to move.\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 4): This position is a floor (.), so it\u2019s valid to move.\n- Moving UP to (4, 4): This position is a floor (.), so it\u2019s valid to move.\n\nFor my next move, I am considering moving DOWN to (6, 4) because this keeps me heading towards the area where I can work on the holes, specifically the holes at (6, 3) and (6, 11). This seems strategically beneficial as it keeps options open for future moves. \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should move the avatar down and allow for strategic planning for pushing boxes towards the holes in the next steps."

By pushing the box at (row=3, col=6) into (row=3, col=5) on my next turn, I'll be moving towards the win condition.\n\nSince one of our goals is to make a movement that will change the avatar's position and considering the strategy of targeting isolated boxes:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nMoving LEFT now to the hole at (row=6, col=3) should open up more possibilities for box interactions in the next turn."
