Since the map doesn't allow pushing the box with the current avatar orientation, I should rotate and then attempt to push the closest box forward to create a pathway for movement.\n\nThus, I will execute the **Action Right (2)** to see whether it brings any closer to engaging with the box at (7, 11).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows me to position myself adjacent to a box, preparing for the next play to reduce the box count strategically."

The box needs to be moved left or further down to setup for future moves since the only possibility to drop a box is down (if aligned directly above a hole). \n\nGiven that the avatar is currently at (3, 8), the logical first move is to push the box situated at (3, 11) down into the empty space at (3, 10).\n\n### Action Determination\n- **Action**: Move RIGHT (to (3, 9)) \u2014 This allows the avatar to move next to the box at (3, 11).\n- However, since there are two empty spaces to the right and the box is still unreachable, I can't perform an action that changes the avatar's position. \n\nNext logical action here, since I can't effectively push the box at this moment, would be to move the avatar UP (to (2, 8)) or to (down to (4, 8)) to utilize further space or take advantage of the layout.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up gives an additional layout perspective, providing more room to consider for future moves regarding the boxes.

This would not be a valid move as it would undo the action due to box collision with a wall.\n\nMoving up is a more strategic choice, allowing you to reposition yourself without causing any box to fall or become obstructed.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven this analysis, the best action to take would be to move **up** into an empty space:\n\n``` \nAction:4\n```\n\n### Feedback\nThis move allows you to position yourself safely while keeping the boxes in their current strategic positions, potentially giving you the opportunity to better manage them in subsequent moves as per the plan.

Your goal is to manipulate the boxes and eliminate them by pushing them into the holes while avoiding having the boxes fall into the holes accidentally.\n\nGiven the current avatar position at (5, 8), the next potential moves need careful consideration because:\n\n1. **Box Management**: There is a box at (1, 10), (3, 11), and (7, 11) which can be pushed toward holes.\n2. **Avatar Movement**: Since moving left (5, 7), down (6, 8), or up (4, 8) will not result in any box manipulation, those directions are not strategic at this moment.\n3. **Avoiding Walls**: Rows above and below contain walls ('w') on either side, meaning that lateral movements must first be carefully planned as they could lead to the avatar bumping into walls.\n\nGiven that the current position of the avatar does not change, the next logical action should involve attempting to move downward to inspect opportunities below.

The avatar is positioned at (7, 7) and there is a box directly above it at (6, 11).\n2. There is a hole at (6, 3) and another at (6, 11). The box above cannot fall into the hole at (6, 11) since our avatar will push it but need to be cautious.\n3.
