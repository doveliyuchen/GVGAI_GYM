In this scenario, we have access to two holes, and thus strategic moves must focus on pushing the boxes towards either of these holes.\n\n### Current Situation\n1. The avatar can move to the left (col=4), right (col=6), down (row=8), or up (row=6).\n2. The box at (row=7, col=11) can potentially be pushed into one of the holes.\n3. The box at (row=5, col=2) is farther away but can be accessed by moving up.\n\nGiven the current position (7, 5) of the avatar and the surrounding environment:\n\n1. Up (row 6, col 5) is a valid move, but there\u2019s a hole at (row 6, col 3) that\u2019s too far for the immediate next move.\n2. Moving down (to row 8) also appears viable, but it doesn't help with reaching a box.\n3. Moving left to (row 7, col 4) continues to keep options available but doesn't directly help in moving a box.\n4. Moving right (to row 7, col 6) keeps the avatar in the same row but doesn't additionally help manage boxes.\n\n### Deciding on Action\nGiven all options, an immediate and logical step would be to push one of the boxes towards the hole. However, pushing boxes will require carefully maneuvering the avatar into position.\n\nI will choose to move **left** to (row 7, col 4) as it positions the avatar better while keeping options open for future moves.\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\nFeedback: This left movement keeps options open for better positioning next turn while analyzing how to move the box effectively; I expect to assess the surrounding for a more significant move next round."

The box at (4, 8) can potentially be pushed down to (5, 8) since the cell below (5, 8) is walkable.\n2. The box at (5, 1) could potentially be pushed to (5, 2) or to (4, 1) if we line up correctly.\n3. The box at (7, 11) incidentally is next to our avatar at (7, 9), which means we can push it directly left.\n\nGiven this context, let's first try to push the box at (7, 11) left into (7, 10).\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis should align with the strategy of removing boxes efficiently. I'm expecting to move the box to a position where further moves can lead to its elimination or repositioning towards a hole."

This is a strategic step toward eliminating the box in the next turn.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action aims to position the avatar closer to the box, allowing us to push it into the hole in subsequent turns, aligning well with the strategy of sequential manipulation."

The box at `(row=7, col=11)` can be pushed left, but it requires careful management as it goes towards a wall and doesn't provide a hole option directly.\n\n### Planned Action\nSince there are holes available at `(row=3, col=5)` and `(row=6, col=3)` where immediate box placement could benefit from the box in `(row=6, col=11)`, I will consider moving towards that box for potential future moves instead.\n\nThus, since the avatar is currently positioned at `(row=6, col=4)`, I will move the avatar right to `(row=6, col=5)` to prepare for pushing the box at `(row=7, col=11)` towards that hole in future moves.\n\nExecuting this action should help align the avatar with more options to deal with the other boxes.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action sets the avatar up by moving right and potentially allows interaction with the box in a future turn.
