(background).\n- Below (row=3, col=19): There is a '@' (boulder).\n- Above (row=1, col=19): There is a random object '@' (boulder).\n\n### Strategy Analysis\nBased on the strategies outlined:\n1. **Resource Focus**: The priority is to collect diamonds. Currently, there are diamonds in adjacent cells that can be accessed:\n   - (row=2, col=2) - Diamond\n   - (row=3, col=2) - Diamond\n   - (row=4, col=2) - Diamond\n   - (row=5, col=2) - Diamond\n   - (row=6, col=8) - Diamond\n   - (row=7, col=18) - Diamond\n   - (row=8, col=2) - Diamond\n   - (row=9, col=14) - Diamond\n\n2. **Avoiding Damage**: The avatar should remain cautious of enemy entities (like crabs): \n   - The crab located at (row=8, col=20) directly below the avatar\u2019s column could pose a risk if the avatar moves too close.\n  \n3. **Movement and Rotation**: The avatar is currently surrounded by walls and boulders which restrict movement in multiple directions. The avatar cannot move left or down due to the boulders, and moving right will just put it next to empty space.\n\n### Recommended Action\nGiven that left and down movements are blocked, and right will not lead to any immediate benefit, the most advantageous action is to **move upwards (row=1, col=19)** where there is a boulder. \n\nHowever, all upward positions lead to entities that don't provide diamonds at the immediate turn. Therefore, the avatar should use the available direct diamond option by moving right to explore more.\n\nThus, I will choose the action to:\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis action is meant to improve the strategic positioning of the avatar for better choices in upcoming moves and potentially access unknown resources or diamonds on the right side."

The closest diamond to the avatar's current position horizontally is at (3, 2).\n\nTo reach the diamond at (3, 2), the avatar would need to move left through the following positions:\n\n1. **First Move (3, 20) to (3, 19)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n2. **Second Move (3, 19) to (3, 18)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n3. **Third Move (3, 18) to (3, 17)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n4. **Fourth Move (3, 17) to (3, 16)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n5. **Fifth Move (3, 16) to (3, 15)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n6. **Sixth Move (3, 15) to (3, 14)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n7. **Seventh Move (3, 14) to (3, 13)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n8. **Eighth Move (3, 13) to (3, 12)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n9. **Ninth Move (3, 12) to (3, 11)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n10. **Tenth Move (3, 11) to (3, 10)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n11. **Eleventh Move (3, 10) to (3, 9)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n12. **Twelfth Move (3, 9) to (3, 8)** - Clear path (dirt `&`)\n13. **Thirteenth Move (3, 8) to (3, 7)** - Clear path (boulder `@`) (Cannot pass)\n   \nSince we cannot reach the diamond directly, I will take a step towards the left to analyze further options or find a new way to diamonds avoiding a blockage.\n\n**Action**: Move left one step to (3, 19).\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\nBy taking this action, I expect to keep heading towards the main objective of collecting diamonds and survey further surroundings for advantageous moves."

Move towards positions that have diamonds.\n2. Avoid enemies (notably the crab '$' at (8, 20)).\n3. Utilize walls and boulders to maneuver safely across regions with enemies.\n\nNow, my avatar's current position is (2, 19), and based on the rules, the immediate action I can take is to navigate towards a nearby diamond. The diamond at (2, 2) is quite far, while there's a diamond at (2, 11) with a clear pathway. \n\nSince I need to collect diamonds and avoid staying idle, I will first move left to (2, 18). This action will rotate my position towards left and, on the next turn, let me move to (2, 17) if I need to continue left, or I can decide based on the next state of the game.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy of collecting diamonds while keeping an eye on enemy movements.
