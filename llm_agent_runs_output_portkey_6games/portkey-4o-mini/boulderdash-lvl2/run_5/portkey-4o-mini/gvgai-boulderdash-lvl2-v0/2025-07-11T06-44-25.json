The primary objective is to collect diamonds while navigating through the environment. \n\nAnalyzing the immediate area, I see that there is a diamond ('%') at row 6, column 8 and several other collectibles at different locations, but since there's a maximum cap of 9 diamonds to retain before reaching the exit (row 11, column 20), the strategy will depend on how many diamonds we currently have.\n\nWe should prioritize movement toward the exit while being aware of how many points we've gathered. Since the immediate area doesn't suggest any enemies, our path appears clear. \n\nGiven that we're currently positioned at (6, 22), the next step would be to move toward the exit at (11, 20). The move towards the exit is also necessary to ensure we're making progress as indicated in the strategies provided.\n\nThus my action will be:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n``` \nThis move will head down towards the row where the exit is located, keeping in line with our objective of reaching the exit while managing diamond collection."

    "content": "Given the current state, you are positioned at (6, 22) with the avatar represented by 'a'. Notably, there are several diamonds (symbol: '%') in the vicinity, and you need to manage your diamond collection to ensure you can safely reach the exit (symbol: '*') at (11, 20).\n\nYour current diamond count isn't specified, but it is crucial not to exceed the limit of 9 diamonds in total.\n\n### Map Overview (near your position):\n- **Bottom Row**: \n  - At (7, 19), there is a diamond that you could collect.\n  - At (8, 2) and (8, 3), there are more diamonds.\n- **Accessing Exit**: \n  - The exit door at (11, 20) is just a few rows below and towards the left.\n\n### Directional Potential:\n1. **Down (7, 22)**: Free space; you can move here.\n2. **Left (6, 21)**: Free space; you can also move here.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n1. Collecting the diamond at (7, 19) which is below would keep you on the right track to further explore before heading to the exit.\n2. Make sure the action doesn't cause your position to remain unchanged.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will move **down** to (7, 22) for an additional strategy that would allow for potential diamond collection while cautiously navigating towards the exit.\n\n```Action: 4```\n\nI expect this will allow for potential diamond collection in the next move while keeping an eye on my overall count in a safe manner."
