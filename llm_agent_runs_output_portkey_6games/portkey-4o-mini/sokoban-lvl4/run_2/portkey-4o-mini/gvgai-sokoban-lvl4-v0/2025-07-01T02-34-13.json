Surrounding the avatar, we have a box at row 1, column 2, and a variety of walls and floor tiles nearby. \n\n### Objective:\nThe goal is to eliminate all boxes by pushing them into holes while navigating the confined space, avoiding walls, and ensuring the avatar does not fall into any holes.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- The avatar is positioned adjacent to a box (1,2) on the left and empty floor to the right (1,4 and 1,5). \n- Below the avatar, there are several accessible floor tiles (row 2).\n- There is a hole located at (6,3), which is far from the avatar's current position and will require maneuvering of the boxes to reach.\n\n### Deciding Action:\nFrom the current position, the most logical initial action is to push the box at (1,2) to the left and move the avatar to (1,2). This will also make space for future moves towards the hole.\n\nHowever, the game's mechanics state that if the avatar cannot move in its intended direction due to a wall or box, it will step back and can rotate to attempt again. It doesn\u2019t seem like the box will push into any walls as they are not adjacent to it, and there are no immediate dangers in terms of holes in the vicinity.\n\n### Action:\nI will attempt to push the box to the left. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should successfully move the box to that position and help start lowering the count towards winning the game. I expect to see the box move to (1,1), leaving my avatar at (1,3)."

The walls ('w') completely surround the area except for the current row where the avatar is located, making movement somewhat restrained.\n\n### Analysis of Actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: It would move the avatar to (2, 2), which is open but does not seem to directly facilitate pushing any boxes into holes.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Would move to (2, 4), which is also an open floor but again does not directly contribute to the goal.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Moving down to (3, 3), this is free space but similarly does not produce an advantageous outcome.\n4. **ACTION_UP (4)**: This would take the avatar to (1, 3), which is not allowed since that position contains a hole (0) and would mean a loss.\n\nGiven that the optimal goal is to push boxes into holes but must navigate carefully to achieve this, the best immediate action is to push the box that is adjacent to the avatar upwards toward the hole. \n\nSince the last position was checked and moving to the left, right, or down does not create any immediate gain and moving up is not allowed, the focus shifts back to recalibrating the movement strategy to utilize box movement effectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo effectively eliminate the box, I will take the action to move the avatar **LEFT (1)** to position (2, 2). This action will set me up to move back in the next turn to push the nearby box upward.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis places me in a better position to eventually facilitate the box's movement into the hole in subsequent turns, adhering to the strategic plan of systematically eliminating boxes."

The hole is located down at (6, 3), and to do this, the avatar must push the box downwards.\n\nFollowing the prescribed strategies:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: I need to push the box into the hole at (6, 3).\n2. **Use Walls to Your Advantage**: There are walls surrounding the area, so careful movement is key.\n3. **Be Cautious with Boxes**: I can only push the box, and it needs a clear path to the hole.\n4. **Work Systematically**: Start by pushing the box downward into an open space.\n5. **Monitor the Count**: Keep track of how many boxes are left.\n\nAs the first step, I will push the box down into the space at (2, 2). The action to take is `ACTION_DOWN`.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis should push the box at (1, 2) downward to (2, 2).
