No boxes nearby.\n- **Up (ACTION_UP):** Moves to (1,4), also a floor (.), but does not bring the avatar any closer to a box.\n- **Down (ACTION_DOWN):** Moves to (3,4), a floor (.), again does not provide immediate benefit.\n\nThe best potential action appears to be moving **left (ACTION_LEFT)** to position (2,3), after which the avatar may determine the next move towards the box.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```  \nMoving left positions us close to exploring further actions around the box and hole effectively."

The holes offer points when a box falls into them.\n\nGiven that the avatar can move and potentially interact with the box positioned to the left at (1, 7), the most efficient approach is to assess lateral movement before attempting to push any boxes.\n\n### Proposed Action\nSince the avatar is at (6, 6) with nothing in the immediate right (6, 7) and (6, 5) is open space, the next logical move is to go **down** towards (7, 6), as this could open additional options, since currently, the left (5, 6) is also blocked by walls, and moving up or left would not result in box interaction.\n\nLet's execute the following action:\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n### Feedback\nBy moving down, I expect that this might create additional movement options for the future turns since it keeps the avatar engaged with open spaces and potential pathways to interact with the boxes effectively."

Additionally, there's a box (`@`) at (1, 7) that I can potentially interact with.\n\nHowever, in the current state, I cannot reach the box since the only valid moves would be to either move up or right\u2014both of which will not eliminate a box. Since my last action has not resulted in movement, I should plan my immediate action carefully. \n\n### Available Actions\n1. **Move Up (5, 4)** to explore upward where no immediate action towards eliminating a box occurs.\n2. **Move Right (6, 5)** also leads to just moving to an empty space without any box interaction.\n\nSince the left direction would be to a hole but is not interacting with a box currently, and moving down is blocked by a wall, I will opt to **move up (5, 4)** for now to perhaps find a route afterward. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move is exploratory, allowing for better position reevaluation, which is crucial for long-term strategy in the current box-and-hole context."

The only box currently visible is at (row=1, col=7).\n\n### Strategy Analysis\nGiven that the avatar can move freely in all directions except through walls or into boxes directly:\n1. To access the box at (row=1, col=7), the avatar needs to move vertically up to row 2, then navigate to the box and push it down into the hole at (row=6, col=3).\n\n### Expected Action\nAs the next action is focused on positioning the avatar for better access to the box:\n- Moving **left (ACTION_LEFT)** to (row=3, col=2) is a feasible option since it opens up space and positions the avatar closer to moving up into a position to access other potential moves without directly interacting with the box or the hole yet.\n\nThus, the selected action is as follows:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action keeps the avatar mobile, and I expect to be able to plan a subsequent action towards pushing the box into the hole effectively."

The nearest hole is at (row=4, col=3), which is two movements down and one movement right from the avatar's current position. However, the box itself must be brought into a position where it can roll into the hole.\n\nBefore making any push, I can move the avatar one step to the right to approach the box for the next push. \n\nTherefore:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis should allow me to get closer to the box positioned at (row=1, col=7) on the next turn, moving strategically towards pushing it into the hole afterwards."
