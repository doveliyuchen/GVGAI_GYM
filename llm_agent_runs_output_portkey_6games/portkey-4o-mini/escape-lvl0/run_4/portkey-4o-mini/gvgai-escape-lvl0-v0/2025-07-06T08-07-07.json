There are blocks ('@') scattered throughout the level, which I may need to manipulate to create a path toward the exit and avoid the holes.\n\nBased on the layout and my current position, moving to the right (ACTION_RIGHT) appears to be the most logical move since there is a box (@) in (6, 6) that provides flexibility, and it also moves me closer to the exit path without encountering any immediate danger.\n\n### Executing the Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right makes sense to progress toward the exit, and I expect to see whether I can interact with the box on the next move or create a possible pathway without getting trapped."

    "content": "Analyzing the current state of the game, the avatar 'a' is located at position (6, 6). The immediate surroundings include boxes '@', empty spaces '.', and holes '$'. The exit is located at (1, 11), which is significantly above the avatar's current row.\n\nTo strategize for the next move:\n1. **Immediate Layout**: The avatar can move to the right (6, 7) and is currently next to two boxes at (6, 7) and (6, 8).\n2. **Objective**: The ultimate goal is to navigate the avatar upwards towards the exit without falling into any holes. The current best option appears to be moving towards boxes that can help maneuver through the level.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will choose to move the avatar **up** to position (5, 6) since there are no walls blocking that direction and it could lead to a potential path towards rearranging or using boxes in row 5 strategically.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action aims to assess potential movement opportunities upward while keeping in line with the objective of reaching the exit efficiently."
