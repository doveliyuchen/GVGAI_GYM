An immediate concern is to assess whether I have collected enough diamonds. Currently, I don't have that data, but I will assume I have fewer than 9 diamonds since reaching the exit is a goal.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\nTo reach the exit door while ensuring I have fewer than 9 diamonds, I can either move up to the exit if the diamond condition is satisfied, or explore for more resource collections if the optimal action isn't possible at this moment.\n\nSince it appears that I might not have confirmed the diamond condition, the safest action is to explore. Moving right could potentially unblock a diamond or useful path while keeping access to vertically move and check my resources.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect that moving right will allow me to find more items or gain more information about my current diamond count while positioning myself closer to any potential pathways."
