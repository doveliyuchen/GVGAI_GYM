I can see multiple paths ahead, but my initial goal should be to clear obstacles and maintain a safe route toward the exit.\n\nThe immediate area around my avatar (10, 13) contains:\n- (10, 12): dirt (`&`)\n- (10, 14): additional dirt (`&`)\n- (10, 17): butterfly (`#`)\n- (10, 18): boulder (`@`)\n\nTo move toward the exit, I need to clear the dirt block at (10, 12) first to create a clearer path forward. \n\nTherefore, I will use my sword to clear the dirt at (10, 12) first.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nThis will allow me to clear the obstacle and create a path toward the exit while keeping my diamond collection in check.
