Moreover, it keeps the potential of discovering more diamonds on future turns.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action feels prudent as it leads me to a safe spot while targeting further resources for my next moves."

The nearest diamond is at (3, 4), located below my current position.\n\nFor my movement, I'll first adjust my avatar's direction downwards (to (11, 5)), and shift down again if there is no obstruction on the next turn to reach (3, 4).\n\nI'll initiate by moving down:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis should allow me to gather resources and create an advantage while avoiding enemy confrontation for now."
