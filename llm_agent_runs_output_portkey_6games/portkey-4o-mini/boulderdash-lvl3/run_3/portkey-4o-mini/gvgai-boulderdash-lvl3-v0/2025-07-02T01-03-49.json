Moreover, the boulder directly above (10, 7) limits movement upwards.\n\nRegarding movement, the best immediate action is to navigate to the left (to (11, 6)), which is a safe dirt space and moves you away from the crab. The next immediate danger is avoided while opening up future movement options.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will keep me safe from the crab threat while exploring nearby areas and managing resources accordingly.

According to the strategy discussed, I need to assess the surroundings and act accordingly.\n\n1. **Surroundings:** The area around my avatar has an exit door (at (2, 6)) that I am far from. There are various collectibles (diamonds) and enemies (including a crab at (11, 3) or $(row=11, col=3) and a butterfly at (2, 17) or #(row=2, col=17)) that need to be navigated around or confronted carefully.\n\n2. **Potential Actions:** \n   - Moving in any cardinal direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN) could either lead me to collect resources (like diamonds) or engage with enemies. Since I need to avoid enemies unless necessary, careful navigation is required.\n   - The map indicates there are several '@' (boulders) nearby that I can use to create barriers or possibly navigate around.\n\n3. **Current Position Analysis:**\n   - Moving LEFT to (11, 7) is a safe option as it is a dirt tile ('&') that won\u2019t threaten my avatar.\n   - Right (11, 9), down (12, 8), and up (10, 8) either stay in dirt tiles or lead towards potential issues.\n\nFollowing the strategy of movement and resource management, I will move LEFT to take a safe route.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is intended to ensure my position becomes a little closer to potential collectibles while maintaining a safe distance from the threatening enemies."

The safest action seems to be to move either left or right to create distance from the crab while exploring my surroundings for valuable items.\n\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (4, 0):** This would move me currently to (11, 4), but there are no diamonds. \n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (4, 3):** This would move me to (11, 6), which opens up potential for later exploration in rows with more items, particularly towards the diamonds located at (4, 1) and potentially closer to the exit.\n\nConsidering these options, moving right will also keep me further away from the crab and provide more options for future turns.\n\nI will take the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action should help me avoid immediate danger from the crab while allowing me to look for diamonds or safe paths.
