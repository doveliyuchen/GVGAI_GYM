There are walls (b), dirt (&), boulders (@), and enemies (butterflies (#) and crabs ($)) around my position.\n3. The exit door is located at row 2, column 6.\n\nMy primary goal is to collect at least 9 diamonds and safely navigate to the exit. I need to act wisely to avoid enemies while simultaneously moving towards the diamonds.\n\nFor now, to progress, I will move **Down** in order to approach occupancy in Row 9 where I could shift towards the diamonds row-wise.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should provide me with better positioning and an opportunity to assess my next moves towards collecting the diamonds while avoiding hazards. I expect that this aligns with my strategy of collecting diamonds early and avoiding enemies or hazards on the way."
