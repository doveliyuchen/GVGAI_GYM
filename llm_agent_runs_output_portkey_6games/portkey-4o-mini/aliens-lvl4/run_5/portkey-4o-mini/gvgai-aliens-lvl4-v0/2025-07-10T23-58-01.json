My avatar is in the leftmost column. \n2. **Move Right**: I could reposition towards the right to find a better attack angle on the aliens.\n3. **Use Missile or Is Sam**: If I can effectively target any aliens directly above or to the right of me.\n\nGiven the observed positions of aliens:\n- There are enemies directly above in columns 0 to 5 in rows 1 and 2, which should be prioritized.\n\nTherefore, moving right (col 1) would not only potentially give me a better position to reposition but also allow me to set up for attacking aliens in the next action phase.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis move is intended to position my avatar better for defensive and offensive maneuvers while targeting the immediate threats.

The aliens are currently too far away to be attacked directly by missiles, but I can prepare for the next turn.\n2. **Move to Action Position**: Since the avatar has not moved, I need to move appropriately to take action against the aliens or to dodge bombs.\n\n### Next Action Decision\nI will **move left (2)** to give myself a better angle to either attack the aliens or respond to any bombs that might drop in the next turn.

However, since the avatar is at column 0, moving left might not be possible, but it can rotate.\n   - **Right** (`ACTION_RIGHT`), which could potentially bring the avatar closer to shooting the aliens directly ahead.\n\n### Strategy\nThe primary strategy is to prioritize eliminating aliens so they don\u2019t damage the base. The avatar's position at (10, 0) is quite distant from the aliens but still functional. However, since the avatar has not moved from the last turn, it's essential to take a more aggressive action to engage the aliens.\n\n#### Suggested Action\nGiven that there are aliens directly above:\n\n- I will choose to shoot at them (`ACTION_USE`).\n\n### Action Execution\n``` Action: 1 ```\nShooting at the aliens is crucial to prevent them from damaging the base and to potentially score points.
