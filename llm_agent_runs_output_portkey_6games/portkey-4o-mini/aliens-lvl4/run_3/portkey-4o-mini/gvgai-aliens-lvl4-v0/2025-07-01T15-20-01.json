The aliens are currently above you, but they're not immediately attacking since they are positioned at row 0.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince you cannot shoot directly at the aliens right above you (not indicated as an action) and to prepare for future actions against these aliens, you should move horizontally to position yourself optimally.\n\nI will proceed with moving to the right.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\n### Feedback on Action\nMoving right keeps you at row 10 and should allow for potential better positioning against future threats from the aliens, while also keeping you away from immediate danger regarding their projectile attacks.

At row 1, column 26 and 27, there are enemy aliens present.\n- There are no visible portals on your current row, but it is essential to keep an eye on the rows above for potential spawn points or incoming threats.\n\n### Immediate Next Steps\nTo adhere to the overarching strategy of defensive play and focusing on portals:\n\n1. **Movement Decision**: Since the avatar's position needs to change to actively engage with the playing field and align with the strategy of targeting portals and protecting the base, moving the avatar to the right (2) will allow a better overview and potential engagement with the nearest alien threats while also positioning for future actions.\n\n### Proposed Action\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, which should help position it to potentially engage with aliens and scout for any alien portals that may need to be destroyed in subsequent turns.

Directive from the strategy indicates that maintaining a viable position to shoot at aliens while minimizing exposure to enemy attacks is crucial.\n   \n2. **Game Mechanic Review**: You can perform four actions: do nothing (ACTION_NIL), shoot (ACTION_USE), move left (ACTION_LEFT), or move right (ACTION_RIGHT). It's essential to check if there are immediate threats present or if your position needs adjustment.\n\n3. **Nearby Enemy Threats**: Observing the map, there are a few alien green sprites ('@') on lines above your current row, specifically row 0 (multiple) and some in row 1. However, no direct projectiles or bombs are currently threatening your avatar. \n\n4. **Strategy Alignment**: The strategy suggests targeting alien portals and defending your base. Since neither portals nor your base are immediately under threat, moving strategically can place you to engage.\n\nGiven the above points, your current position does not allow for projectile attack due to the height requirement as all alien threats are above. Thus, a lateral movement is advisable to potentially reposition for a better attack angle.\n\n### Action Selected\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis move to the right could allow repositioning towards columns with alien threats above while maintaining a safe distance and without immediate threats towards the base.
