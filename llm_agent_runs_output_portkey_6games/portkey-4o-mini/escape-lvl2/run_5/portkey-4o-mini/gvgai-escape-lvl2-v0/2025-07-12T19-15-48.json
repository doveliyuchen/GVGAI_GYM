The goal is to navigate to exit (row=1, col=1) while avoiding holes and managing box placements effectively. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The exit (`#`) is directly above the avatar, but there are walls surrounding the path.\n- The avatar needs to navigate around obstacles such as boxes (`@`) and avoid holes (`$`).\n\n### Strategic Move:\nIn this scenario, the most meaningful action to attempt is to move the avatar upwards (action `ACTION_UP`, i.e., `4`), as this is the direction towards the exit.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this action to lead me closer to the exit; however, I may need to find a different approach if the avatar does not move."

This would potentially allow me to assess nearby boxes or move towards the exit\u2019s direction more effectively, as moving downwards would lead me to a row with more boxes (@) available.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should shift the avatar downwards, potentially providing more options to reach the exit while avoiding holes. I will assess the new position after this action."
