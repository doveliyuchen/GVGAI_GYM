The exit is located at (1, 1) and there are several holes ('$') and boxes ('@') present throughout the level.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the immediate surroundings and determine the best course of action:\n\n1. The avatar at (7, 11) has a wall above it at (6, 11), a hole directly below at (8, 11), and a pathway to the left at (7, 10), which is also a wall.\n2. Moving left is blocked by a wall, so the only available move is to go down.\n3. However, moving down would put the avatar on a hole (at (8, 11)), resulting in a loss of points and potential game over.\n\nGiven that the avatar can't move left or down without falling into a hole or hitting a wall, I need to consider whether moving up might be an option, but since the row above has a wall, that won't work either.\n\nThus, I must take a different approach. Since all immediate moves lead to either walls or holes, I need to reposition elsewhere while avoiding getting stuck.\n\nTo advance towards the exit, I should explore the open pathways. Thus, I will take the following action to avoid falling into a hole and explore alternative avenues instead.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nFeedback: I will move left, even though it is blocked by a wall, as I need to ensure that I cannot perform any further actions in the current state.
