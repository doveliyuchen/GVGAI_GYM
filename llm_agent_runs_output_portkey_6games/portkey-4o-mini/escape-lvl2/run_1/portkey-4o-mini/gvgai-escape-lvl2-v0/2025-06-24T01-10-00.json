The valid actions to take from (7, 7) are:\n   - **Left (7, 6)**: Contains a box ('@') and will result in a box placement interaction.\n   - **Right (7, 8)**: Contains a floor ('.') which is a safe move.\n   - **Up (6, 7)**: Contains a box ('@'), which can be pushed.\n\nGiven the context, moving right to (7, 8) is a safe maneuver and avoids pushing boxes unnecessarily. This allows me to maintain my position while analyzing the next possible choices.\n\n### Action Decision:\nBased on the considerations and strategy, I will take the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action is to move **RIGHT** to (7, 8).
