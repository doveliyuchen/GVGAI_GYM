Therefore, I will need to move right to position myself better. \n\nThe best action right now is to move right to (row 3, col 4) so I can plan a future move towards pushing the box at (row 3, col 2) left.\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\nI expect this action to allow for future interactions with the box located at (row 3, col 2), aligning with the strategy of manipulating boxes effectively."
