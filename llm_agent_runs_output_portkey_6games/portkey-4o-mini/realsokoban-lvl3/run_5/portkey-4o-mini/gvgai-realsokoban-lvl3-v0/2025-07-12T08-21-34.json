Moving right to `(2, 2)` allows interaction with the box, but moving up to `(1, 1)` puts the avatar directly in a hole, which isn\u2019t allowed since it does not interact with the boxes.  \n\nThus, the optimal move is to push the first box into the right, which involves moving right first.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should allow the avatar to prep for pushing a box into a hole, following the plan to manipulate the boxes effectively for scoring points.

Moving left should result in the avatar pushing the box into the hole directly above it.\n2. **Right (to (3, 4))**: This cell is empty ground ('.'), and moving right would not lead to a strategic advantage in the context of pushing boxes.\n3. **Up (to (2, 3))**: This cell is also empty ground ('.'), and corresponds to the same consideration as moving right.\n4. **Down (to (4, 3))**: This cell is empty ground ('.'), offering no strategic advantage either.\n\nThe most logical move, according to the strategy of pushing boxes into holes for points, is to move left to (3, 2) where the box is located. This will allow us to push the box into (2, 2) next turn if it's clear.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move left, which should serve to help manage the boxes on the ground.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left toward the box is a logical step in order to push it into the hole on my next move."

From the avatar's current position (3, 3), moving left (to (3, 2)) would allow the avatar to push the box situated at (3, 2) into the hole at (1, 1), but the wall (at (3, 0)) and the other box create constraints.\n3. Moving down or left will not allow the avatar to immediately make progress because the path contains walls or requires the same action again.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next best action seems to be to move **down** to (4, 3), which is free and might create more options for moving the boxes next:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down, allowing me to explore further for potential box movements next while avoiding being stuck."

The closest box to the avatar is at (row=3, col=2). My best action is to move upwards (to (row=3, col=3)), as this brings my avatar closer to the box at (row=3, col=2) and prepares me for future actions.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to position my avatar adjacent to the box, allowing for further manipulation in the next turn."
