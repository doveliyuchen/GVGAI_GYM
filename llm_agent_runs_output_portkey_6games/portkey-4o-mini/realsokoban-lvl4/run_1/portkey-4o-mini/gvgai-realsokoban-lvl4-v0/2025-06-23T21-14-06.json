To do so, one of the strategies is to navigate the avatar to transform boxes (by moving them into holes). Since you are already adjacent to a box (at 8, 5), it is more strategic to move right to begin manipulating the boxes effectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering that moving right puts us in a position to interact with the box, I will choose to move right first.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow the avatar to interact with the box on that position, leading towards the goal of reducing boxes on the board."
