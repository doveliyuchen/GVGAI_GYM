I expect to see a progression towards gathering the key for further advancements in the game."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I see that my avatar is located on row 7, column 5 and is currently in the 'nokey' state ('*'). There is a key on row 5, column 9 ('#') that I need to collect to unlock the goal. \n\nTo reach the key, I will have to navigate through the map. Since the direct path to the key is blocked by walls and requires maneuvering around them, I will implement a systematic movement strategy to get closer to the key.\n\nFirst, I will move **down** to row 8, column 5. This will also allow me to explore additional possible moves toward the right direction.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to move closer to the key and explore the map further. I expect to see if the position facilitates subsequent moves toward the right or up towards the key."

    "content": "Given the current map state and the player avatar's position 'a', we analyze our next actions:\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar is on row 7, column 5, denoted as '*', which means it is currently in a state of not having a key (nokey).\n- The goal ('@') is located at row 1, column 4 (k), and a key ('#') is available at row 5, column 9.\n- Moving towards row 5, column 9 to collect the key is essential, as the avatar cannot access the goal without it.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. From the current position (row 7, col 5), the immediate upward position (row 6, col 5) is occupied by a quick monster ('%').\n2. A direct upward move may be too risky as it may result in losing health. Therefore, we need to choose a safer route.\n\n### Strategy Suggestion:\nTo reach the key at (5, 9), it's advisable to move through the safest path while avoiding the monster. Since the upper row (row 6) is dangerous, we can first navigate around safely while observing the situation.\n\n1. Move left to row 7, col 4 (which is a floor).\n2. From there, execute upward movements towards (5,9) where the key is located while avoiding the monster.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince immediate upward action is blocked, I'll first take a step left.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left to row 7, col 4 allows for better positioning to plan the next move towards obtaining the key."
