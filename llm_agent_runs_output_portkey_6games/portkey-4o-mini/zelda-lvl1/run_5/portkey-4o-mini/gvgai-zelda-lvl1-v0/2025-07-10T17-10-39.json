Since keys are critical to progress, the first goal would likely be to move towards the area containing the key.\n2. The safest route might involve navigating around walls and avoiding enemies. For now, the immediate action from the starting position should focus on either moving down to access the path leading towards the key at (5, 9) or assessing if there's a better option.\n\nGiven that no specific avatar position was stated, I'll initiate an upward action as a general strategy to navigate towards the key area safely.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\n**Feedback:** This action aims to move downwards in hopes of proceeding toward the area where the key is located.
