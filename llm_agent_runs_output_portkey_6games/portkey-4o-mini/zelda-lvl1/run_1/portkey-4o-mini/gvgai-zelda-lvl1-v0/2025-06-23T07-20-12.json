The monster slow (`&`) is at (3,2) but isn't directly blocking the way to the key or goal at this moment.\n  \n### Strategy Recap\n1. Collect the key (`#`) first. \n2. Avoid enemy engagement unless necessary.\n3. After collecting the key, make your way to the goal (`@`).\n\n### Current Action Decision\nThe avatar should first move towards the key. Given that the position of the avatar is not specified, I will consider it at its starting position before any movement to reach the key.\n\nSince the key is directly below the potential starting point of (5,8):\n\nNow I will choose to move **downward** to collect the key.
