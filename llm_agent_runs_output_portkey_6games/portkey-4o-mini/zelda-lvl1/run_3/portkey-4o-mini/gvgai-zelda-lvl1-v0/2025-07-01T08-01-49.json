Moving to the right from the current position at (5, 7) to (5, 8) is blocked by a wall, meaning the most logical move is to go right to (5, 9) to collect the key. This transformation from `nokey` to `withkey` will allow access to the goal.\n\nHowever, I need to first move to position (5, 8), and since that's blocked, I will need to move first to position (5, 6).\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nBy moving left to (5, 6), this positions me to then subsequently move to (5, 7), potentially navigate to (5, 9), and collect the key on the next turn.

Additionally, there are some tiles that represent open paths (denoted by `.`).\n\n### Objective:\nGiven that the goal is to collect the key to proceed toward the goal door, the immediate task is to reach the key located at (row 5, col 9).\n\n### Considerations:\n1. Movement Options:\n   - I need to navigate through the level and avoid any possible enemy engagements, especially since I can currently lose to them.\n2. Next Move:\n   - Since my current position is on row 7 and column 6, the key at (row 5, col 9) can be accessed by moving up or right. But based on the walls and current state, I need to decide which direction effectively avoids enemies and walls.\n\n### Best Action:\nFrom position (7, 6), I can move:\n- Up (to 6, 6) \u2192 still in danger from potential enemies nearby\n- Right (to 7, 7) \u2192 still an open path\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will make the action to move up to (6, 6), which provides a clearer path potentially toward the key without engaging immediate combat.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nFeedback: Moving up should bring me closer to the key, allowing me to pursue the goal effectively. The expectation is to reach a position where I can directly approach the key next turn."
