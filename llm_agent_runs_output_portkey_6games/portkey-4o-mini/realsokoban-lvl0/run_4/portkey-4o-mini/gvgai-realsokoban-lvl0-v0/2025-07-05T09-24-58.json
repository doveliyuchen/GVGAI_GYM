Two boxes are located nearby at (5, 6) and (1, 2). The holes available for pushing boxes into are located at (2, 3) and (4, 3).\n\nThe optimal strategy is to push the box at (5, 6) into the hole at (4, 3) since moving left won\u2019t yield any progress and moving down or up also won't have any available moves due to walls.\n\nTherefore, the first action will be to move to the right and push the box into the hole at (4, 3).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nI expect this action will push the box into the hole, transforming it into a 'boxin' sprite and increasing the score, which aligns with our strategy to get all boxes into holes."

Since the ultimate aim is to manipulate the boxes into holes, we need to consider:\n\n- **Potential future moves** after this immediate action.\n- **Positioning**: Moving left or right would keep the avatar versatile for interacting with boxes immediately next to it (at (5, 6) or (5, 2)/(5, 4)). \n\nBy moving **left to (5, 3)**, I can potentially access the hole at (4, 3) in further actions and be close to the box at (5, 6) so I can push it into the hole if other conditions align.\n\nThus, I'll choose to execute the action to move left:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis move is directly part of the strategy to better position my avatar for future interactions with the box at (5, 6) and aim for the holes promptly."

Since there are boxes at positions (1, 2) and (1, 4), you could push one of these boxes towards its nearest hole.\n2. Moving left or right will not change the position of the avatar if it reaches a wall because walls (marked as '$') border the area above and below the avatar's row.\n\nSince we want to push one of the boxes into position but need to be mindful of the movement restrictions:\n\n- I will move left to (1, 2) to push the box at (1, 2) towards the hole at (2, 3).\n\nThus, I'll proceed with the action as follows:\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action aims to also set up trying to push the box into the hole.
