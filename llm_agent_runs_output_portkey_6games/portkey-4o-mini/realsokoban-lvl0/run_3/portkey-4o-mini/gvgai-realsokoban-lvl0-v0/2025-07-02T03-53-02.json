It does not directly help in pushing any box into it because there is no box adjacent.\n2. **Move RIGHT to (2, 5)**: This square is another hole. However, this position does not immediately help either, since the rules specify needing to push a box into a hole.\n3. **Move UP to (1, 4)**: This square is open (floor). Moving there could provide more options in the next turn, but doesn\u2019t help with immediate box actions.\n4. **Move DOWN to (3, 4)**: This square is also a floor. Similar to the UP move, it doesn't yield immediate box interaction but could provide strategic positioning.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nMoving left into the hole or right seems to be ineffective to manipulate boxes since both holes are only adjacent to boxes (and won't allow setup for a move next). Ideally, we want to position the avatar such that we can push a box into an adjacent hole.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven these observations, moving UP to (1, 4) would potentially set up future moves to push boxes into holes as it opens left and right options. \n\nI will execute the UP action.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move opens up further avenues for box manipulation in the upcoming turns by facilitating alternate paths."

(5, 6) -> box (`@`)\n\n### Current Direction:\nFrom the initial position (3, 2), the avatar can move:\n- Up to (2, 2): This is possible and the space is clear.\n- Down to (4, 2): This is possible and the space is also clear.\n- Left to (3, 1): This action leads to a wall (`$`), which is blocked.\n- Right to (3, 3): This is a floor (`.`) and accessible.\n\n### Actions:\nSince the objective is to position ourselves to eventually push boxes into holes, the most effective action is to prepare for interacting with the box located at (1, 2). To reach there, moving upward first is a good option to access the box since it is directly above. \n\n### Decision:\nThus, the best action now is to move **up** to coordinate (2, 2).\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of planning ahead to access the boxes and aids in moving closer to achieving the goal of eliminating all boxes.

Here are the immediate options:\n\n### Available Directions from Current Position\nLooking at the avatar's surroundings:\n- **Up (2, 3)**: There is a hole ('#').\n- **Down (4, 3)**: There is a hole ('#').\n- **Left (3, 2)**: There is ground ('.').\n- **Right (3, 4)**: There is ground ('.').\n\n### Actions to Consider\n1. **Up to (2, 3)**: Move to a hole ('#'), but the avatar cannot push any box into the hole since it's just a hole without a box on the adjacent side to push.\n2. **Down to (4, 3)**: Move to a hole ('#'), but again, with no adjacent box to push into it.\n3. **Left to (3, 2)**: This is just ground ('.'), moving into an empty space.\n4. **Right to (3, 4)**: This is also ground ('.'), moving into an empty space.\n\n### Proposed Action\nSince the avatar cannot push any boxes into a hole directly from its position, the best move is to shift horizontally or vertically to prepare for future moves. Moving left or right is the same in terms of the game mechanics since neither move results in immediate box pushing.\n\nThus, I will move the avatar left to (3, 2).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move allows the avatar to explore potential new positions while keeping an eye on nearby boxes for future movements.

Notably, there are holes directly next to your avatar's position and boxes that can be pushed toward these holes.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves:\n1. **UP (to row 3, col 4)**: You would move onto the ground '.' which does not affect the box count.\n2. **DOWN (to row 5, col 4)**: You would also land on the ground '.' which keeps your position neutral.\n3. **LEFT (to row 4, col 3)**: You would move to the hole '#', which does not allow movement because the avatar cannot enter holes.\n4. **RIGHT (to row 4, col 5)**: You would land into the hole '#', which is the same restriction as moving left.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nBoth moves (UP or DOWN) keep your position safe, but you need to progress toward pushing the boxes into the holes. The box to the right of your avatar at (row 1, col 6) could potentially be pushed into the hole at (row 2, col 5) by first navigating your avatar into position.\n\n### Best Move Decision:\nGiven the information above, a logical move would be to go **UP (to row 3, col 4)**. This allows you to position your avatar closer to manipulate the boxes above, potentially opening a path towards pushing boxes toward their respective holes in future moves.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows me to reposition closer toward the boxes while still being able to push them into holes later on.

Thus, the available actions available are to go up or to the right.\n\n- **Action Up (move to (row=2, col=4))**: This position is valid since it spaces closer to holes where boxes can be pushed.

However, we should plan our actions to push boxes towards the holes effectively because we need to eliminate the boxes in the level.\n\nAnalyzing potential moves:\n1. **Move Up (row=2, col=2)**: The avatar would move to an empty space. No box interactions occur here.\n2. **Move Down (row=4, col=2)**: The avatar would move to another empty space. No box interactions occur here.\n3. **Move Left (row=3, col=1)**: The avatar would also move to another empty space. No interaction.\n4. **Move Right (row=3, col=3)**: Again, the avatar moves to an empty space without interaction.\n\nSince we don't want to aimlessly move without strategy, the optimal action would be to push boxes toward the holes. However, striking at them is not possible at the moment, since all nearest boxes are either blocked or too distant to engage directly.\n\nSince moving in any direction at this moment will yield no change in sprite status\u2014meaning the avatar position will remain unchanged and not fulfill the win condition\u2014the next step to consider is to push towards the closest box.\n\nCurrently, the strategy indicates needing to push boxes into holes, without further interactions leading to a reverse deduction. My best option now is to try and get closer to the first box on my left (row=1, col=2). Therefore, the action should be to move **Left** to stay in the vicinity of the box.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should put me closer to potentially pushing the box next, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing box movement towards holes."
