Given that the avatar is currently adjacent to several boxes, the movement should prioritize facilitating box movement into holes.\n- The box at (3, 6) is closest to the holes below it. Thus, the immediate focus should be on moving that box down.\n\n**Next Action**:\n- I will move down to (2, 6) to position myself to later push the box at (3, 6) down towards the hole at (4, 5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will help set up the next movements to push a box into the holes effectively."

The avatar's current position is (4, 5), where there is a box ('@') directly to the right at (4, 6) and another box below it at (5, 5).\n2. There are two holes (in row 2 at (2, 3) and (2, 5), and one hole at (4, 3)), which should be prime targets for pushing boxes into.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- Moving left to (4, 4): This would move the avatar closer to the hole at (4, 3).\n- Moving right to (4, 6): This would move the avatar to the box and potentially allow interaction.\n- Moving up to (3, 5): The avatar would still remain in the row of boxes.\n- Moving down to (5, 5): This will have no change as there\u2019s already a box there.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nConsidering I need to act efficiently towards transforming the boxes into holes and evaluating the need to manage space correctly, moving **RIGHT** to (4, 6) will position me to push the box towards the hole in row 2.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nBy moving right, I am positioning myself to push the box located at (4, 6) towards available holes, which is a key part of the strategy for progressing towards the win condition."

However, moving **right** allows the avatar to push the 'box' at (4, 6) towards the hole.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nChoosing to move **right** towards the box allows for pushing it down into an optimal placement towards the hole in future turns.\n\n```Action: 2```\nThis action is anticipated to push the box towards the hole, setting up for subsequent moves to transform it effectively into a 'boxin'."
