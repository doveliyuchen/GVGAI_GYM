However, the most immediate action is potentially ineffective since there are no boxes adjacent to this hole to push in.\n\nInstead, to strategize better, I'll move up (to (2, 5)), getting closer to the box at (2, 2) for a potential push towards the hole in my next moves.

The avatar can potentially push a box into one of the holes to transform it into `boxin`, increasing the score.\n2. The nearest box is located at (3, 2).

However, since there's a hole directly to the left where the box can be pushed from (3, 2) into the hole at (3, 5), I should instead backtrack and shift the focus towards making the box available for pushing.\n\n### Best Course of Action:\nTo push a box into the hole, I should move up to either (2, 2) or down to (4, 2), but since (3, 6) puts me adjacent to (3, 5, #) and (3, 7, #) that can be pushed after manipulation, I will need to approach from above.\n\n**Moving Down does not result in a new position, thus I will reorient and move left continuously until a box is successfully pushed into the hole.** \n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the conditions, I will take the action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect this will allow my avatar to rotate and potentially enable more actions to effectively handle the boxes while adhering to strategic recommendations based on the game's mechanics."

The box at (3, 2) can be pushed towards one of the holes at (3, 5) or (3, 6).\n\nTo execute this plan, I will move the avatar left to (3, 6) which will allow me to push the box at (3, 2) towards one of the holes next turn as it leans closer to the hole.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nThis action means I will move the avatar to the right, which is counterintuitive as my position will remain the same unless the action succeeds in changing the direction first.

I can perform actions to move left, right, up, or down.\n2. Since the holes are located to the right of my avatar, I might want to move towards them or create a path that allows me to slide a box into the hole.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n- **Moving Up (Action 4)** to (2,5): This movement accomplishes nothing as it hits the wall ('$') at (2, 5).\n- **Moving Down (Action 3)** to (4, 5): This does not provide immediate assistance.\n- **Moving Left (Action 1)** to (3, 4): This is also not helpful as there are walls above and below at (3, 4) blocking further movement.\n- **Moving Right (Action 2)** to (3, 6): This moves the avatar into a hole and would be a valuable action, as it positions the avatar close to the boxes to interact with.\n\n### Decision:\nI should move right to (3, 6) where there is a hole. While it does not directly manipulate the boxes, I should align myself properly for future moves.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will enable me to position myself advantageously toward the holes and prepare for box manipulation in subsequent moves."

If the avatar moves to this position, it will be able to push a box into this hole in subsequent moves.\n2. If the avatar were to move RIGHT, it would not change position as there's another hole at (3, 7), which will lead to the same scenario.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\nFollowing the strategy of maximizing box transformations, moving LEFT to the hole at (3, 5) aligns with the plan since it might allow pushing one of the boxes into the hole on the next turn (if we're allowed to move the boxes after moving the avatar).\n\nBased on the above insights, I will execute the action of moving LEFT.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nI expect this action will allow interaction with the hole at (3, 5) in the next turn, which is part of our strategy to clear boxes from the field."

The box at (3, 2) can be pushed forward into the hole at (3, 5), which will result in a positive score transformation (box to boxin).\n3. The avatar appears to be able to push from its current position horizontally since no walls are immediately to the left or right.\n\nNow, I will take the action to move right (from (3, 6) to (3, 7)) to position myself adjacent to the hole and prepare for the next action of pushing the box. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should result in the avatar aligning with the hole, ready to push a box into it in the next move, maximizing score and strategically moving towards winning."

The nearby holes reside at (row 3, col 5) and (row 3, col 6).\n\nTo proceed strategically and following the rules mentioned, the optimal action is to push a box into one of the holes to increase the score:\n\nCurrently, the avatar cannot directly push the boxes at (row 3, col 2) or (row 2, col 2) towards the holes due to their respective distances. Therefore, the most logical action is to move left, which won\u2019t change the avatar's position initially (due to wall interactions), necessitating a subsequent move.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Attempt to move left**: I will execute the action to rotate towards left to see if the avatar can move closer to either box for potential interaction in the next turn.\n\nThus, the action to perform is:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left should position the avatar to prepare for future box manipulation."

To the left of my avatar (at (3, 5)), there is a hole, and to the right, there is space.\n- The box at (3, 2) is directly manageable, as I can push it into the hole at (3, 5) to transform it into a boxin, which helps in reaching the win condition of removing boxes.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\n- I will move right to (3, 7), which is empty ground. This action may also allow for a transition towards future moves where I can analyze how to best position myself to push boxes.\n\nGiven that I can move to an empty space and analyze further strategies, I will proceed with the action. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving to the right to evaluate further options is crucial and aligns with the overall strategy of maximizing box transformations."

The most immediate actionable box is at (3, 2). To remove the box at (3, 2), the avatar needs to move towards that box, which means moving left.\n\nNow we will summarize the current actions:\n\n1. **Left Action** (`ACTION_LEFT`, which is action 1) will move the avatar closer to box (3, 2), where it can potentially push it towards the hole (3, 5) or (3, 6) in subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the action of moving left:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nMoving left is strategic as it positions the avatar closer to the box and ultimately towards achieving the goal of removing all boxes from the level. I expect this will allow the avatar to push the box in the next moves towards the hole for scoring points."

The quickest route to the closest box at (3, 2) is to move left from the position (3, 5):\n\n1. Move left to (3, 4) - this is clear ground.\n2. Move left again to (3, 3) - this is clear ground.\n3. Move left again to (3, 2) - where the box is located.\n\nRegarding the given mechanics, since the movement to the left is valid and would produce a movement towards a box for interaction, I will proceed to execute a left action.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action should effectively bring the avatar one step closer to interacting with a box, aligning well with the strategic plan to clear the level efficiently."
