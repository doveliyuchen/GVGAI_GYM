However, checking the immediate adjacent spots, the avatar can either move up, down, left, or right:\n\n- **Left (3, 5)**: This position has a wall ($) which would cause the avatar to step back.\n- **Right (3, 7)**: This position is a hole (#) which is not applicable since the avatar cannot use the hole directly.\n- **Up (2, 6)**: This position is a floor space (.) which doesn't contain any obstacles.\n- **Down (4, 6)**: This position is also a floor space (.).\n\nThe most effective play is to move up to (2, 6), allowing me to assess better options from there to push the boxes into the holes since it's impossible to move horizontally (due to walls and the hole).\n\nThus, the action to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should enable the avatar to move upwards, avoiding walls and positioning strategically for the next turn.

The action here has to be strategic, considering the boxes' movements toward the holes, especially since my avatar can only interact with boxes by pushing them.\n\n### Immediate Actions\nSince the avatar is currently free to move:\n- Moving up (to 2, 6) results in staying on the ground but does not affect boxes. \n- Moving down (to 4, 6) also stays on the ground and keeps the situation unchanged.\n- Moving left (to 3, 5) or right (to 3, 7) would cause the avatar to directly interact with holes but does not push the boxes on its own.\n\nGiven the immediate options and since the goal is to eliminate boxes efficiently and the avatar's current position does not change upon interaction, it would be wise to first prioritize getting closer to the boxes or directly into a position that allows pushing them into holes.\n\n### Action Choice\nInstead of unnecessary motions, the best initial action is to push the boxes closer to a hole. The box directly above the avatar at position (3, 2) can be moved. \n\nSince the avatar is currently at (3, 6), moving left (to 3, 5) would not move the avatar yet.
