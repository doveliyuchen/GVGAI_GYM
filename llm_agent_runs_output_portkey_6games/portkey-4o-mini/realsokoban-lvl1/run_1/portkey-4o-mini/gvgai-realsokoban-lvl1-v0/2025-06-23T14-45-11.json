The avatar can move right to (3, 6) (toward the hole), which allows interaction with the box at (3, 2) in subsequent moves.\n2. The best strategy is to start moving right to position the avatar adjacent to the hole.\n\nGiven the objective to maximize efficiency in moving boxes into holes, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action should allow the avatar to get into a position where it can move towards a box in the next turn.

The objective is to move the boxes (@) into the designated holes (#) while ensuring there are no boxes left in play.\n\nCurrently, there are two boxes:\n1. One located at (row 2, col 2).\n2. Another one located at (row 3, col 2).\n\nGiven that there is a hole at (row 3, col 5) directly adjacent to my avatar, my potential actions involve moving the boxes toward the hole.\n\nSince I am currently positioned adjacent to a box (row 3, col 2), I'll aim to move the box into the hole I can reach. However, I must first move the avatar to ensure that I can push the box effectively.\n\nBy analyzing my position, I can either move down to row 4 (But that area is filled with walls), move up to row 2 (It's just a box), left or right doesn't change my current position since hole is at right, but there is also a box in row 3, col 2. \n\nMy best action here is to move left, which will position me to eventually move one of the boxes into the hole on the next turn.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this action will help me reposition and allows for better box management in my next move."
