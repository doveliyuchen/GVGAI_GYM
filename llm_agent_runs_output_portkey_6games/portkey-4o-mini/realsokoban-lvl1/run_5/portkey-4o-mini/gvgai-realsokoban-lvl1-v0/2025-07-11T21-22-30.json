The objective revolves around manipulating the boxes located at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) to convert them into \u201cboxin\u201d states by moving them onto the holes.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. The avatar is currently at (3, 5) and can act either to the left or right. \n2. The hole is directly to the right, which means the best initial move is to push one of the boxes into the hole.\n3. Since there are boxes at (2, 2) and (2, 3) accessible by moving the avatar, we need to think about which box to move. Moving the box at (2, 3) into (3, 6) will help in earning points towards the objective.\n4. We should also consider the movement mechanics; if the avatar doesn't move after an action, further actions may be required.\n   \nGiven that the avatar can move right to (3, 6) and utilize the hole immediately without obstruction, the best action to take right now is to move to the right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right should allow the avatar to interact with the hole positively, aligning with the strategy of converting a box to \u2018boxin\u2019 and optimizing the score."

The objective remains to manipulate the boxes (represented by '@') to transform them into \"boxin\" states and address any necessary score considerations.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the immediate surroundings. The positions of the boxes are:\n- Box1: (2, 2)\n- Box2: (3, 2)\n\nThe holes in the game are located at:\n- Hole1: (3, 5)\n- Hole2: (3, 7)\n\nThe climbing mechanism is that a box can't move through walls, so our goal would be to move one of the boxes into the nearest hole. \n\nTo progress, let's first consider moving closer to Box2 at (3, 2). Moving to the left (to (3, 5) to access the hole) would not be possible without first moving the box.\n\nHence, the immediate and logical action we can apply would be to move the avatar left towards Box2 at (3, 2) to interact with it.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this move will position the avatar correctly next to Box2, allowing it to push the box into the hole on the next turn, thus aligning with the strategy of box management effectively."

The hole directly below allows for an easy placement of a box, which can then generate points.\n3. As there are two boxes in the immediate vicinity, moving one of them toward the hole seems to be the best next action.\n4.
