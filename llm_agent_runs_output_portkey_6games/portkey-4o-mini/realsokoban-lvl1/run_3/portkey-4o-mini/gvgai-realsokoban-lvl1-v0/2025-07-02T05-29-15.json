However, we should be careful as the hole is to receive a box, not the avatar.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (move to (4,5)):** This would move the avatar further down into more ground and away from the intended mechanisms.\n4. **ACTION_UP (move to (2,5)):** This would place the avatar at (2, 5), which is again ground ('.').\n\n### Strategic Move\nThe desired approach is to push one of the boxes into the holes effectively.
