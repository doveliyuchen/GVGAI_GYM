Although this indicates I need to take a different action than before to adapt to the current threats.\n2. **Threats**: The bombs are directly above my avatar at (6, 18) and (7, 18). If I do not move and take action, I could be hit by these bombs. \n3. **Objectives**: My priorities include eliminating aliens for score maximization and protecting my avatar from threats.\n\n### Current Strategy Efficiency:\nIn line with the strategy to prioritize defense and maintain movement, I need to reposition myself. Moving either LEFT or RIGHT might allow me to dodge the threats while enabling me to aim towards or shoot at the nearby aliens that are present on the map.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that staying stationary could result in damage from the bombs, I will choose to move LEFT from (10, 2) to (10, 1).\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action aims to reposition my avatar to enhance survival chances while still keeping a line of sight to attack the aliens. I expect this movement will better align with the goal of maintaining my avatar's health and adding to my score by targeting the aliens."

The aim should be to eliminate them while ensuring the avatar remains safe.\n3. **Movement Tactics**: The avatar needs to either move closer to the aliens to engage them or reposition to avoid any potential incoming threats in the future (none detected right now).\n\nGiven that the previous position of the avatar has not changed yet, a directional action is necessary to either get closer to the aliens or prepare for a shot.\n\n### Decision\nThe avatar can move to the right to take a position closer to the aliens.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action will reposition the avatar closer to the aliens, aligning with the strategy of maximizing scoring by preparing to engage them."

The left action (2) would move your avatar to (10, -1) (which may not be allowed since it's off the grid), while the right action (3) would keep you within bounds at (10, 1). \n\nSince you need to move away from your current position and you want to get closer to the aliens, the best action would be to use your projectile ('%') to attack. However, first, you need to position your avatar properly to aim at the aliens effectively. Given that both aliens are two rows above you at (8, 2) and (8, 3), moving right to (10, 1) keeps you safe while potentially allowing for future projectile usage.\n\nMy chosen action is:\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis action moves your avatar to the right while staying safe from the current alien threats. I expect this aligns with the strategy of repositioning to improve your chances of attacking the aliens while maintaining distance from any bombs or missiles."
