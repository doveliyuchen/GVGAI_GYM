Since your avatar's position has not changed from the last state, it\u2019s essential to determine the best course of action.\n\n### Game Analysis\n- There are aliens above your current position, and your objective is to eliminate them while protecting your base located at (row=1, col=0) to (row=2, col=2).\n- The current position of your avatar means you're getting close to the aliens; however, they are quite far currently (up at row 0), which requires you to engage them effectively.\n\n### Strategy Suggestion\n1. **Resource Management**: Since you need to eliminate all aliens, consider firing missiles towards the aliens directly. However, if you currently cannot shoot, repositioning may be necessary.\n2. **Positioning**: If the avatar does not change position, repositioning left or right is essential to get into a better shooting angle.\n\n### Current Action and Expectation\nGiven that the only action you can perform right now relates to repositioning or using available weapons, my recommendation is as follows:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action moves your avatar to the right. By moving to the right, you can potentially reposition to engage the enemies, ensuring the safety of your base by keeping a distance from the enemies\u2019 projectiles.

Specifically, they occupy rows 6, 7, and 8 in columns 17 to 22 and column 2.\n\nAs the game objective is to eliminate enemies while protecting your base, the priority should be to move towards the aliens to attack them. Since your avatar is currently at position (10, 1) and hasn't moved, the next action should involve moving left or right to attack an alien.\n\nUpon analyzing the map, the closest accessible alien is in position (8, 2).
