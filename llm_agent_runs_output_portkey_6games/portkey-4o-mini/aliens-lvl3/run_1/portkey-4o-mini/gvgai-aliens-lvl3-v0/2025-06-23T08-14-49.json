The potential move to the right (to (10, 2)) will likely keep the avatar safe from immediate threats while looking to engage the aliens.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nI expect moving to the right will provide a better angle for effective targeting at upcoming threats while maintaining mobility to dodge any attacks."
