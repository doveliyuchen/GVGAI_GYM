The `box` located at (2, 5) is the closest to a hole (2, 4) that can be pushed into.\n\nNext, to push the box at (2, 5) into the hole at (2, 4), we need to be positioned to the left of the box at (2, 5). Currently, our avatar at (2, 1) needs to move to the right to get in position.\n\nHere's the action that we'll take:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThe action is to move right, which should change our position to (2, 2). This will then allow us to evaluate our next move towards the box which is at (2, 5). The feedback here is to optimize our positioning towards transforming the boxes into `boxin`. My expectation is that this move will position us closer to the boxes, enabling further actions leading to the transformation goal."

I can push this box to the left if I subsequently move in that direction.\n2. **Move Right (to (6, 3))**: This space is empty `(.)`, which allows rotation but does not push any boxes.\n3. **Move Up (to (5, 2))**: This space contains `(.)`, which is also empty and would allow movement but doesn't allow pushing a box or scoring.\n4. **Move Down (to (7, 2))**: This is also a wall (`$`), making it an invalid move.\n\n### Determining a Meaningful Action:\nSince the aim is to transform boxes (`@`) into `boxin` (`#`) by pushing them off into holes, moving left to (6, 1) to push the box aligns with my strategic goal.

Since the avatar can't reach any box directly from the current position, I should first check if I can navigate toward the left or up.\n\nMoving **Left to (3, 2)** does not provide an immediate opportunity to interact with the boxes, but from there, I can check options to move further left or up.\n\nLet's take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action allows me to analyze further options, potentially moving upward next to engage with the box directly above."
