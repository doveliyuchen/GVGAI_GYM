The immediate layout around the avatar and the boxes is as follows:\n- There are boxes at (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 5), (5, 1), and (5, 5).\n- There are holes located at (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2).\n\n### Current Plan\nTo make effective progress, the strategy suggests focusing on the nearest box that can reach a hole without causing any unwanted reversions back to `box`. \n\n### Possible Moves\n1. **Left to (5,3)** - Not useful as there is a ground space.\n2. **Right to (5,5)** - There is a box present there. Moving this box would be beneficial if there's a subsequent hole to move it to.\n3. **Down to (6,4)** - This will result in the avatar moving to an empty position.\n4. **Up to (4,4)** - This would allow access to a hole (4, 2) next, but there are no nearby boxes.\n\n**Best Action: Move Right to (5,5)** \nThis allows for the next potential move to actively engage with the box at (5,5) since it is directly above (4,5) which leads back down towards potential holes.\n\n### Action and Expectation\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right to box (5,5), will allow for later interactions leading to transforming boxes into 'boxin' states while managing score effectively."

The avatar can interact with the surround boxes, which we can possibly move into the holes.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- If we move **LEFT (to 5, 3)**: The avatar would try to move into a hole ('#'). This doesn't cause the avatar to move since it cannot occupy a hole directly, but it can rotate towards that direction.\n- If we move **RIGHT (to 5, 5)**: The avatar would move into a box ('@'), causing it to bounce back since it can't push the box to a hole immediately. \n- If we move **UP (to 4, 4)**: The avatar will also occupy a hole ('#'), which is also an ineffective move. \n- If we move **DOWN (to 6, 4)**: The avatar would just move down into the ground ('.'), which doesn't help in progressing towards our objectives regarding boxes or holes.\n\n### Strategy Recommendation:\nBased on the analysis, the most sensible action is:\n- **Move RIGHT (to 5, 5)** to make the avatar interact with the box next to it. This provides options to possibly move the box next turn toward the hole in some further step if favorable.\n\nAs the avatar does not move immediately into the box, we need to take care of repositioning it correctly while preparing for the next interaction/push.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action allows the avatar to engage with the box for potential movement toward the hole in subsequent turns."

Move `LEFT` to (5, 4) - this would result in a rotation towards the left without any immediate movement.\n2. Attempt another `LEFT` to (5, 3) - here, I can interact with both the box at (5, 1) and the hole at (5, 3).\n\nSince my avatar must first attempt to actively move before interacting further, I'll initiate my first action as moving `LEFT` towards exploration.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis should allow repositioning near the boxes, facilitating future interaction with them.

The left action just moves me into the box, which does not contribute positively towards the win condition.\n\nI'll choose to **move right** to explore the empty ground and see if it allows for further useful actions or opportunities.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should position me better for future moves without causing a neighbor-box or wall bounce.
