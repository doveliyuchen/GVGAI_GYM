The closest box that can be pushed to a hole is at (5, 1) beneath the avatar's position. \n\n### Best Action Consideration\nMoving upwards to (2, 3) gives the opportunity to start maneuvering towards the nearby hole at (2, 2) or (2, 4) and facilitate the movement of the adjacent box if necessary. \n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n```Action: 4```\nThis action should begin to open paths for pushing boxes into holes, aligning with the overall strategy of box management and optimizing scoring opportunities."

This keeps the option open to push the box above it against the hole in future actions and secures immediate interaction with the box.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should facilitate the first steps toward clearing a box and managing their positions effectively in the upcoming moves."

The avatar needs to maneuver boxes toward the nearest holes while also being cautious of wall interactions.\n\n#### Possible Actions for the Avatar\n1. Since the avatar is currently at (3, 2) and can only move to adjacent floor spaces (not walls), the avatar can take the following actions:\n   - **Move Down (3, 2) to (4, 2)**: This moves toward a hole but also puts the avatar next to a box that could be moved in future turns.\n   - **Move Up (3, 2) to (2, 2)**: This directly enters a hole but does not help in moving boxes significantly as the box at (2, 5) is inaccessible from here.\n   - **Move Left (3, 2) to (3, 1)**: This just moves toward an empty space, giving no advantage.\n   - **Move Right (3, 2) to (3, 3)**: This leads to a hole but doesn't affect any boxes.\n\nConsidering all this, the best immediate action is to **move down to (4, 2)** to access the hole directly next to another hole in the next row and potentially manipulate boxes around.\n\n### Decision\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down allows me to access the hole at (4, 2) and prepares me for an optimal next turn as I can then interact with the boxes more effectively."

The **main objective** is to eliminate all boxes. The player can do this by moving the boxes into the holes.\n2. The avatar needs to be maneuvered around the boxes to interact with them as efficiently as possible.\n3.
