We have to plan which box to move first and the best direction to achieve this.\n- **Box Movement**: Since there are walls around, I need to ensure that I can push boxes without getting them stuck.\n- **Avatar Manipulation**: I need to move the avatar to a location where it can push a box toward a hole.\n\n### Current Actions and Planning:\n1. To reach the box at `(1, 4)`, the avatar will have to navigate around some obstacles. It cannot push the box left due to walls blocking it.\n2. The most immediate action should involve either getting closer to the box at `(1, 4)` or pushing it toward the hole `(5, 10)` afterward.\n\n### Action Decision:\nTo begin, I should move the avatar down to row `6`.

The goal is to push boxes located at (row=1, col=4), (row=1, col=7), (row=2, col=11), (row=5, col=1), and (row=5, col=10) into the holes at (row=3, col=10) and (row=5, col=10). The strategy suggests analyzing the layout and planning the movements carefully.\n\nCurrently, I will proceed to check for possible immediate actions. Since I am at (row=6, col=3), I can move left (to (row=6, col=2)), right (to (row=6, col=4)), up (to (row=5, col=3)), or down (to (row=7, col=3)).\n\n1. **Checking possible moves**:\n   - Moving left would go to (row=6, col=2) which is a floor space ('.').\n   - Moving right would go to (row=6, col=4) which is also a floor space ('.').\n   - Moving up (to (row=5, col=3)) is a floor space ('.').\n   - Moving down would land on (row=7, col=3) which is also a floor space ('.').\n\nAll proposed movements lead to valid tiles. I need to consider my options carefully.\n\n2. **Next best step**: Since there is a box at (row=5, col=1) and (row=5, col=10), it's better to focus on moving towards those boxes. Moving *up* to (row=5, col=3) brings me closer to the box on row 5. After moving up, I can strategize about pushing that box toward the hole at (row=5, col=10) in the next move.\n\nI will execute the move:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nMoving up towards row 5 will allow me to assess further moves next turn and potentially push a box soon."
