Moving **UP** to (5, 4) can potentially allow for further movement to (4, 4), but there are walls on either side of (4, 4).\n2. Moving **DOWN** to (7, 4) stays within the unblocked floor.\n3.

ACTION_DOWN (move down)\n4. ACTION_UP (move up)\n5.

However, since it can't currently do that direction, it would be prudent to first push the box at (5, 1) to make progress.\n\n**Recommended Action**: Since the avatar is right next to the box at (5, 1), moving up to (5, 1) will not change its position, so I'll attempt to push the box upward. \n\nThe available action would be to move to the box first, and since the current priority is pushing that box immediately:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nI expect that moving up will mean the avatar will push the box up into the area at (4, 1) and open up future paths in the game for strategy execution."

The immediate move down (ACTION_DOWN) may not result in a change in position since it would lead into a wall.\n2. Since the avatar can't currently move horizontally or downward to interact with a box, the next best action is to take a step back and re-evaluate potential moves. \n\nTo decide on the most advantageous move, I'll keep the avatar in its original row and explore upward, which provides access to available boxes.\n\nGiven that moving down is ineffective, let\u2019s analyze a left move instead:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will allow the avatar to check if there are any movement opportunities toward the boxes.

Since the boxes are at (5, 1), (2, 1), (3, 7), and (4, 7), we want to find the most strategic movement to potentially push a box towards a hole.\n\nThe closest hole is at (5, 10). The box at (5, 1) can be pushed, but first, the avatar needs to find a way to get to it and it is currently blocked by walls if we were to move up to access it.\n\n### Action Decision\nThe best move considering the positions available and aiming to advance towards removing a box could be to move left to position (5, 3). This opens up paths next turn either to push towards or access other boxes, which is essential for the next actions.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is expected to position the avatar more strategically for future box movements while avoiding any immediate dead ends against walls."

The avatar is surrounded by a lot of open floor at its current row.\n2. The boxes are reachable, and some are already aligned toward the holes:\n   - The box at (row=5, col=1) can be accessed and pushed.\n   - The box at (row=3, col=7) is directly above one of the holes, making it easy to push there.\n   - There is also a box at (row=4, col=7) which can be pushed up to the hole at (row=3, col=10).\n\n### Best Move:\nTo start the process of removing boxes from the board, the best action would be to push the box at (row=3, col=7) into the hole at (row=3, col=10). However, for the avatar to be able to push the box up, it needs to move up to (row=6, col=7) first.\n\nSince the avatar is currently at (row=7, col=5) and has to move to push the box, I will take ACTION_UP to move the avatar upward.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move will position the avatar closer to the box, preparing it for the next move to push the box into the hole.

There are opportunities to push boxes located at (5, 1), (4, 7), and (3, 7) towards the hole (5, 10).\n2. You cannot move through walls, hence any movements must consider the walls' positioning; however, there\u2019s a clear path towards the box at (5, 1).\n\n### Strategy Consideration\nGiven your current strategy guidelines, the next step would be to advance towards an actionable box. Since moving left (to (5, 2)) would be futile as it would not lead to any box movement, and downwards is also blocked:\n\n#### Optimal Action\nSince your goal is to clear boxes and there is a box directly above (4, 7), moving up to (4, 7) would allow you to eventually push that box into the hole located at (5, 10) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion\nProceeding with the action to interact with the box will help manipulate it towards the goal better.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move allows me to position myself effectively next to a box, preparing for subsequent actions to push it towards the hole."

    "content": "Given the current state, our avatar 'a' is located at (6, 2). Around the avatar, we can see that the area is mostly clear (with '.' indicating the floor) on rows 6 and 7, but there are boxes ('@') scattered in rows above. The objective is to move boxes into the holes (represented by '0') in order to win.\n\nAnalyzing the current state:\n- The immediate row (row 6) above is clear, and below it (row 7) is also largely clear.\n- To the right of the avatar in row 6 (6, 3), there's floor space, but to the left (6, 1), there's no box or wall.\n- There are holes located in (3, 10) and (5, 10).\n\nThe best course of action here is to move into an empty space that positions us better for future box manipulations. In this case, the only reasonable move is to the right, towards (6, 3).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nI expect this action to move the avatar to (6, 3), positioning it to plan its next moves better towards the holes or getting closer to the boxes so they can be manipulated effectively."

The holes where boxes can be placed are located at (row=3, col=10) and (row=5, col=10).\n\nLooking at the avatar's surroundings, there are no walls directly adjacent to it on the left, right, or below. This means the avatar can move freely without any immediate restrictions.\n\nGiven the following analysis:\n- The avatar cannot move up since it's already at the lowest opened row in this segment.\n- Moving left or right does not directly facilitate pushing a box due to their locations.\n- However, moving down allows access to (row=7, col=3), which could provide more movement or allow for further strategic options.\n\nGiven this reasoning:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to open up new pathways or set up for subsequent moves towards removing boxes from the play area."

    "content": "To determine the next action, we analyze the current position of the avatar and the surrounding environment based on the provided map layout.\n\n### Current Position\n- The avatar 'a' is located at (row=6, col=3).\n- The adjacent positions are:\n  - Up (5,3): empty floor (.)\n  - Down (7,3): empty floor (.)\n  - Left (6,2): empty floor (.)\n  - Right (6,4): empty floor (.)\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves\n1. **ACTION_UP (to row=5, col=3)**: This is a valid move as it leads to an empty floor. However, the next potential action could become limited depending on the placements of boxes nearby.\n  \n2. **ACTION_DOWN (to row=7, col=3)**: This is also a valid move to an empty floor, providing similar opportunities for further movement.\n\n3. **ACTION_LEFT (to row=6, col=2)**: Leads to empty floor without any immediate obstacles or boxes.\n\n4. **ACTION_RIGHT (to row=6, col=4)**: This leads to empty floor as well.\n\nSince the goal is to remove boxes by manipulating them into holes, the initial actions should focus on bringing the avatar closer to the boxes.\n\n### Strategy\nConsidering the immediate surrounding:\n- All moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) would position the avatar on empty floors but do not interact with boxes. \n- However, moving **UP** to (5,3) or **DOWN** to (7,3) could provide future opportunities to maneuver around nearby boxes located at (5,1), (3,7), and (4,7).\n\nFor effective box management, **I will choose to move UP** as that may simplify later access to boxes around rows 2-5 where multiple boxes exist.\n\n### Decision\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving **UP** may yield new opportunities to push boxes into the holes in the next turns."
