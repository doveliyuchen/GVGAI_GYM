Our main objective is to eliminate boxes by moving them into holes, but the avatar needs to be in a strategic position to do so.\n\nGiven that there\u2019s no immediate action possible towards the boxes from the current position, I will pick an action that allows for greater maneuverability and a potential plan to reach the boxes later.\n\n### Next Move:\nI will move **down to (7, 4)** since it keeps options open and takes the avatar toward another level row where more strategic movements involving boxes can happen in future turns. This move will also create spacing from the ones above and allow for more insight into potential actions concerning the boxes.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action keeps my options flexible for future moves, and I expect more room to strategize movement towards the boxes."

The only boxes we have are at (1, 1), (1, 7), and (2, 11). To win, we need to push these boxes into holes.\n2. The closest holes to the avatar are at (3, 10) and (5, 10). However, moving towards those holes will not allow direct access to any box.\n3. The player is currently positioned at (5, 3), which allows movement options.\n\nThe best action to take is to move UP to (4, 3) to create more options since we can't push any boxes while directly next to them due to an obstacle.\n\nWith all this in mind, I will take the action to move the avatar UP:\n\n```Action:4``` \n\nThis action is expected to open up new potential moves while strategizing towards pushing boxes into holes more efficiently."

The goal is to eliminate all boxes by pushing them into holes ('0').\n\n## Current Layout Analysis:\n- The nearest hole is located at (row=3, col=10) and another one at (row=5, col=10).\n- The current position of the avatar has only one possible action, which is to move either left or up, because there is a wall on the right, down, and immediately above the avatar is a wall up but to the left, there is a box to interact with.\n\n## Chosen Action:\nMoving LEFT (to (row=4, col=2)) seems the most logical next step since it allows the avatar to potentially move to the box at (row=1, col=1) in future moves, setting up necessary conditions to push the box into a hole later.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should let me reposition, preparing for the next move towards interacting with the box.
