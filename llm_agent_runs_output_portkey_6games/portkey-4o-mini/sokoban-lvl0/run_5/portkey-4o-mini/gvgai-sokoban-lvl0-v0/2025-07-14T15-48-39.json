This may allow for a better positioning for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThe action is chosen to navigate towards empty space, with the expectation of opening up more movement options on the next turn."

To begin pushing the boxes towards the holes, the avatar could consider moving either left, right, or down.\n2. The boxes at (row 1, col 1) and (row 1, col 8) are far from holes, but the box at (row 1, col 5) could potentially be moved towards the hole at (row 5, col 10) by using the avatar correctly.\n3. Since the row with the important hole (row 3, col 10) also needs to be accessed, it's crucial to find a path to remove boxes efficiently.\n  \n### Action Decision\nGiven the avatar's current position, the most strategic action to take is to move **UP (4)**. This will not only allow the avatar to rotate itself towards potentially engaging with boxes but also gives access to more options on the higher row (row 5), where another box can be manipulated towards the hole.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move should align with the strategy to position the avatar better for future actions involving the boxes.
