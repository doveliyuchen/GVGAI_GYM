The closest box is at (1, 5). Although it's two rows away and directly beneath a wall, the only box we can effectively aim for is to position ourselves.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1.

Since the avatar is currently at (6, 1), the possible moves within the boundaries are:\n\n1. **Up (to row=5, col=1)**: There is a floor space, so the avatar can move up.\n2. **Down (to row=7, col=1)**: There is a box, which can be pushed.\n3. **Left (to row=6, col=0)**: This is a wall, movement not allowed.\n4. **Right (to row=6, col=2)**: This is a floor space, so the avatar can move right.\n\n### Targeting the Win Condition:\nTo win, we need to eliminate all boxes. Since two boxes are located directly below (7, 1) and above (5, 1) the avatar's current position, we may want to consider which way can help us continue clearing as efficiently as possible.\n\nIf I choose to move down:\n- The avatar will move to (7, 1) where there's a box. \n- The following move could then be to push this box either left, down, or right (depending on its surroundings) to further facilitate clearings.\n\nIf I move up:\n- The avatar will go to (5, 1) where there\u2019s an empty space but would not immediately interact with any box.\n\nCurrently, the most strategic move seems to be to **move down to (7, 1)**, which will allow the avatar to push a box right away.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy as it utilizes the nearby box for immediate elimination and opens up further movement options."

The objective is to eliminate all boxes while avoiding falling boxes into holes (which are located at (row 3, col 10) and (row 5, col 10)).\n\n### Analysis of Current Position\nFrom the avatar's position (7, 2), the potential actions are as follows:\n- **Left (7, 1):** This position contains a box '@', which can be pushed.\n- **Right (7, 3):** This position is empty ('.'), allowing for movement.\n- **Up (6, 2):** This position is empty ('.'), allowing for movement.\n- **Down (8, 2):** This position is a wall ('w'), prohibiting movement.\n\n### Strategy Application\nBased on our strategy, we want to consider pushing boxes into spaces that allow for easy navigation while avoiding edges where they could be pushed into holes. Since the left (7, 1) position contains a box, it would be strategic to move the avatar left to push this box out of the way.\n\n### Recommended Action\nI will execute the action to move left, which is beneficial as it allows me to interact with a box and potentially position it for an efficient elimination.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to engage with the box is necessary and aligns with the strategy of leveraging box interactions effectively."

The box at (2, 1) can be accessed from your current row but will require some maneuvering.\n\n### Suggested Action\nTo push a box from your current position towards an accessible area, the most straightforward move is to shift up to (6, 2), getting closer to boxes in row 2.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis move will position the avatar closer to the boxes; after analyzing the state, I expect that this action will not only advance the avatar to a new position but also provide more options for moving boxes in subsequent turns."
