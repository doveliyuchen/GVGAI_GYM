To reach the exit, I need to create a path through strategic movements while avoiding holes and walls. \n2. The primary movement from the avatar is likely upward since the exit is significantly above (7, 6) to (1, 1).\n3. I must also consider that moving into walls will result in a step back, and navigate around them wisely. \n\n### Proposed Action:\nFrom the current position (7, 6), I have the following valid actions:\n- Moving left to (7, 5).\n- Moving right to (7, 7).\n- Moving down to (8, 6) is an open path but adds no progress toward the exit.\n- Moving up to (6, 6), where there is a box, will allow me to potentially push or bounce.\n\nThe most strategic action here would be to move **up** into (6, 6), as it allows the avatar to potentially push the box to create pathways moving up towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action to push the avatar into a position closer to the boxes, where more movements can be analyzed for clarity in reaching the exit."

Under the rules, it seems like moving towards the exit requires maneuvering around the boxes and avoiding the holes.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the avatar is currently at a position where it has the ability to interact with nearby boxes or move towards an open space, the best immediate move is to navigate up, as the exit is vertically positioned above the avatar.\n\nThus, I will execute the action to move **up**.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is a strategic choice to advance towards the exit while considering the obstacles and avoiding any interaction with dangerous holes or walls.
