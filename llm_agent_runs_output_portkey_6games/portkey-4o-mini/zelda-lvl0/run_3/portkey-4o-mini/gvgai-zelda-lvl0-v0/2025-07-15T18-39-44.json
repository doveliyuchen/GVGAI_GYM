If I move down to row 6, col 10 (there is an empty space below), and then plan to navigate towards the key thereafter, that would be the safest strategy to avoid any quick encounters with enemies.\n\n### Execution of Action\nI'll take the action to move downwards where I can safely navigate next.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving down seems prudent as it opens up more opportunities to explore the map further and collect the required key without immediate threat from enemies."

We should maneuver to collect the key and avoid any unnecessary engagements with the monsters.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Move UP from row 5, column 10 to row 4, column 10 first. This will allow us to scope out the situation at the last-minute before directly approaching the key.\n- Assuming row 4, column 10 is safe to traverse, we\u2019ll then engage UP again to row 3, column 10 to collect the key.\n\n### Executing the First Move:\nI will first move UP to check the area just above me.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nI expect to safely approach row 4, column 10 and assess my next steps from there."
