Since there hasn\u2019t been a specific avatar location given in the state description, I will assume the avatar is situated at a logical point in the grid, preferably near accessible keys or goals.\n\n### Known Entities around Avatar\n- The floor contains passageways (represented by '.') and other entities such as keys (#), goals (@), and monsters ($).\n- Based on the provided grid, the nearby key is present at `(3, 10)`, and the goal is at `(5, 10)`.\n- Notable enemies are positioned around the vicinity, notably at `(3, 6)` and `(7, 3)`.\n\n### Next Actions\nAssuming the avatar is positioned near `(5, 9)` (considering it needs to move towards key and goal):\n1. **Key Collection**: Moving towards `(3, 10)` to collect the key first seems prudent.\n2. **Avoiding Monsters**: There is a monster at `(3, 6)` and engaging with it directly could risk losing points as the goal is present at `(5, 10)` and will require a key to unlock.\n3. **Movement Strategy**: Using the movement can sometimes involve rotations, so it is essential to ensure the avatar consistently moves towards collecting keys while evading enemy encounters.\n\nGiven this understanding and interpretation, I will now issue the action to move left toward the key (assuming the avatar starts facing down or correctly towards the key).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is to move left towards the key while potentially avoiding an enemy and ensuring I remain engaged in collecting keys to reach the goal effectively."
