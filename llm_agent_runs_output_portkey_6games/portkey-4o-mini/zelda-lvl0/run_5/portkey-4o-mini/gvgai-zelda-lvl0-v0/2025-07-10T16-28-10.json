I need to determine the avatar's position and the locations of keys and the goal.\n\n- **Avatar Position:** The avatar is positioned at (5, 10), where there is a goal sprite represented by '@'.\n- **Goal Location:** The goal is located at (5, 10) and requires a key to be reached.\n- **Key Location:** There is a key at (3, 10) represented by '#'.\n- **Enemies:** There is one enemy (monsterNormal) at (6, 3) represented by '$' that could be a potential threat.\n\n### Current Action Analysis:\n\nThe immediate goal is to collect the key at (3, 10) before heading to the goal. Moving to collect the key should be prioritized before trying to reach the goal since the avatar currently has no key (state 'nokey').\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n\n1. Move UP from (5, 10) to (4, 10) - The area is clear, allowing for movement without obstruction.\n2. Then move UP again from (4, 10) to (3, 10) to collect the key.\n\nMy current action would be the first step towards collecting the key: \n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy of acquiring keys before attempting to reach the goal. I expect to successfully move towards the key's location."

    "content": "To start, let's analyze the current state of the game environment:\n\n1. The avatar is represented as 'a', but its position is not explicitly provided in the current map description. \n2. The goal ('g') is located at (5, 10) on the map.\n3. There is a key ('#') located at (3, 10).\n4. There are various enemies ('$', in this case) located throughout the map, and walls ('w') block certain paths. \n5. There are additional obstacles and strategic points, such as movable walls or interactable sprites, primarily around rows 5 to 8.\n\nGiven that we need to reach the goal at (5, 10) and that there is a key at (3, 10), we should consider the most efficient route while taking any enemies and walls into account.\n\n## Recommended Action:\nFirst, if we are at or near the key at position (3, 10), we should prioritize collecting it since it is essential for winning the level. Then, without the avatar's specific position, we can assume we are close to an action point.\n\n### Taking the Action:\nIf our avatar is indeed positioned to the left of the key at (3, 10), we can move right to collect it.\n\n**Action:**\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThis action is aimed at collecting the key, positioning us to unlock the door later on. Upon collecting the key, we should be in a stronger position to navigate towards the goal, aligning with the strategy of securing keys promptly."
