The only available movement for my avatar is to the left, towards (5, 10).\n2. Up and down are blocked by walls, and right is also blocked by a wall. \n3. I cannot move further up since I am adjacent to a box, and the next applicable square that might be my strategic interest gets blocked naturally.\n\nThus, to prevent stalling my progress and to begin moving towards a safer position, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left seems optimal to open further avenues while avoiding any risks of falling or interacting in potentially dangerous mechanics."

The surrounding area includes walls which are impassable, as well as holes '$' which are dangerous. \n\nAnalyzing the player's possible movement options, the immediate moves available are:\n\n- **UP (4)**: to (4, 10) -> box '@' \n- **DOWN (3)**: to (6, 10) -> wall '%'\n- **LEFT (1)**: to (5, 9) -> floor '.'\n- **RIGHT (2)**: to (5, 11) -> floor '.'\n\nSince moving down leads to a wall (which blocks the movement), that's not an option. \n\nMoving **UP** would result in the avatar moving onto a box, which can be useful for future navigation. Although I could also move **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, these moves will only put me on the floor, without significant advantage since they don\u2019t lead closer to the exit.\n\nTo maximize my strategy, I will take the action to move **UP** onto the box, setting myself up in a potentially advantageous position for my next turn where I may push or manipulate the boxes.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move should provide better positioning towards potentially using the boxes in future moves as I navigate towards the exit."

The exit (`#`) is located three rows below my current position in the same column but all the way to the left.\n2. There are several obstacles such as holes (`$`) and boxes (`@`) in the path towards the exit which require careful maneuvering to avoid falling or getting blocked.\n\n### Path Planning:\nTo reach the exit:\n- The most straightforward vertical movement would be downwards to row 7 (to row 5 first).\n- However, row 5 has a hole at (5, 6) and is adjacent to several boxes that can be used strategically.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- First, I can move `DOWN` to (5, 10). From (5, 10), I have the option to either:\n  - Move LEFT to (5, 9) to navigate around the box and hole.\n  - Move LEFT to reach (5, 8) and further explore ways to navigate downwards, still considering the presence of the holes.\n\nSince I need to get closer to the exit and avoid hazards, I will choose to move downwards first.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down should allow me to progress towards the exit and assess further navigation options while avoiding immediate hazards. I expect to get closer to the exit in a safer manner, providing flexibility for subsequent moves."

Pushing it upward may open up more path opportunities.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Since the avatar has several options but can\u2019t go down due to a wall, I will first push the box to create more maneuvering space.\n\nThus, the action will be to push the box up.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should result in moving the avatar in such a way that I can consider further movements afterward.
