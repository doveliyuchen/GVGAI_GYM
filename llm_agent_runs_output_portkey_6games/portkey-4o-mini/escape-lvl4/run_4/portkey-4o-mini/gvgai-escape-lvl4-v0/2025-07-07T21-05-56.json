Moving down is not an option due to the wall, and moving up leads to a floor that could potentially allow interaction with boxes. \n\n### Objective and Strategy\nFollowing the overall strategy, the primary goal is to avoid hazards while maneuvering towards the exit. The exit is three rows down but requires lateral movement as well, particularly to the left since the exit is far left on the map at (7, 1).\n\n### Next Move Calculation\nCurrently, there are no immediate hazards in the vertical and horizontal movements available, but left movement will help navigate toward possible gaps to get down toward the exit row.\n\nGiven that left (to 4, 8) is a safe move and will help align the avatar toward further movement options, the next action will be:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis move should allow better access to navigate downwards toward the exit in the next turns, aligning with the overall strategy of planning moves and avoiding hazards."
