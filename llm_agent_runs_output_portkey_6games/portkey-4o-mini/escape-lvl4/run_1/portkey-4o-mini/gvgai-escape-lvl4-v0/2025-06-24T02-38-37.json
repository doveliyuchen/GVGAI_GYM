The avatar is located at (5, 10) which is one row above walls and just above one possible hole at (6, 6). Below that row, in (7, 1), there is an exit (#) that needs to be reached.\n2.

This will allow assessing if that method aids in clearing potential paths, or manipulating the boxes as advised in the strategy.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nI expect that moving left may enable the avatar to potentially manipulate boxes more effectively in the impending action turns."
