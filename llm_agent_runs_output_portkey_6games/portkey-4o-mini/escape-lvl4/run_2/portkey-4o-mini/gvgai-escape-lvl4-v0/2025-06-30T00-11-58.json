However, there are two clear options to the left and right. Given the overall strategy of maneuvering towards the exit while avoiding potential hazards, moving either left or right needs to be evaluated.\n\n### Exit Position:\nThe exit is located at (7, 1) which is several rows below the avatar's position. \n\nConsidering the available actions:\n\n1. **Moving Left (5, 9)**: This may help navigate towards the exit, but it seems to lead further from the path directly below to the exit.\n2. **Moving Right (5, 11)**: This maintains the horizontal position and keeps options open for further movements downwards after the left as well. \n\nGiven the layout and potential pathways towards the exit (which is more to the left and down), I will choose to move **left**.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nMoving left from the current position is expected to provide better navigation options towards the exit, maintaining strategic alignment without hitting walls or hazards directly."

There are holes and many strategic boxes present in other rows, but they do not directly affect the next immediate movement of the avatar at this moment.\n\n**Strategic Choices**\n- Since we are currently at (5, 10), we can move left to (5, 9) or right to (5, 11) as both are possible movements.\n- Neither movement approaches the exit directly; however, it is important to explore to potentially set up more advantageous positions for future moves.\n\n**Action Decision**\nGiven the analysis, we can move to the left (5, 9) to explore more options but not block ourselves in the process. Moving to (5, 9) still keeps multiple options available for the next move, while (5, 11) would also maintain that flexibility. \n\nBased on the immediate possibilities and potential paths toward the exit, I will choose the left movement option.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action allows potential exploration with the expectation of making further insightful moves towards reaching the exit in subsequent turns."
