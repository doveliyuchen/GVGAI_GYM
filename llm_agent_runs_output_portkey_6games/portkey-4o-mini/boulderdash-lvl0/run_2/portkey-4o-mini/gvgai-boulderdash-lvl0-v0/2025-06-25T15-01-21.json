It's crucial to avoid this enemy and use other strategies for dealing with enemies.\n\n### Proposed Action\nConsidering that I need to collect diamonds and potentially fetch the sword while avoiding enemies, the **most logical action** is to move **down** to (11, 8). This gets me closer to the sword without directly confronting threats.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action allows for a strategic relocation, positioning myself for the collection of items next while monitoring enemy proximity."
