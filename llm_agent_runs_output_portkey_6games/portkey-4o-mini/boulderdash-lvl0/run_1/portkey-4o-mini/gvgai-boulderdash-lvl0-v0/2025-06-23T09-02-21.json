Immediately to the left (7, 10) is an empty space, and above (6, 11) also contains the background.\n- There are diamonds (represented by '%') located around: (1, 6), (1, 19), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 18), (7, 23), (7, 24), (9, 7), (9, 16), (10, 9), (10, 14), etc.\n- The exit is located at (11, 6). \n\n### Action Considerations:\n1. **Resource Collection:** Since the player\u2019s primary goal is to collect diamonds and reach the exit with at least 1 diamond, identifying a path to diamonds would be advantageous.\n2. **Movement Options:** As the avatar is currently in a position where movement is limited by walls and boulders, I need to consider whether moving left or down might set up subsequent moves efficiently.\n3. **Safety:** Avoiding enemies (butterflies and crabs) is crucial. Currently, there are no immediate threats around the avatar's position.\n\nGiven the above considerations, I'll decide to take the action to move left (to (7, 10)), as it opens potential pathways for future moves towards diamonds. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis move should allow further navigation towards collecting resources while potentially avoiding any enemy interactions.
