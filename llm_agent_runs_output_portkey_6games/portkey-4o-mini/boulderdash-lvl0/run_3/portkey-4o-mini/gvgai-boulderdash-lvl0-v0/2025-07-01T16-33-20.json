The avatar can collect diamonds located directly north (at (8, 6), (6, 22), etc.). \n2. There is a potential enemy '$' at (10, 1) directly below us and a butterfly '#' at (7, 1) above.\n3. Based on the previously planned strategies, we need to prioritize moving in safe directions that allow us to collect diamonds while avoiding immediate confrontation.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nThe available actions involve moving left, right, up, or down, or using the sword. Given our current position:\n- **Up (to (8, 7))**: This position has a boulder 'o' and thus cannot be moved into.\n- **Down (to (10, 7))**: This position is clear and allows to potentially explore or collect if there are any diamonds further south.\n- **Left (to (9, 6))**: This will take us to a diamond position (collectable).\n- **Right (to (9, 8))**: This is an empty space and does not further our objectives.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most strategic move is to go left (to (9, 6)) to collect the diamond at that location. \n\n### Conclusion:\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis left move is expected to yield a diamond and get us closer to the target of at least 9 diamonds needed to win."
