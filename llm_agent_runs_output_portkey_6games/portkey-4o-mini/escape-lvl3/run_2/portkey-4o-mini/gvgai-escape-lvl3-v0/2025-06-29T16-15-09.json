The avatar can interact with boxes, and the right moves will help maneuver toward the exit.\n\n1. The avatar can potentially move:\n   - **Left** to (row 2, col 2)\n   - **Right** to (row 2, col 4) where a box is located (this may require pushing a box)\n   - **Up** to (row 1, col 3)\n   - **Down** to (row 3, col 3)\n\n2.
