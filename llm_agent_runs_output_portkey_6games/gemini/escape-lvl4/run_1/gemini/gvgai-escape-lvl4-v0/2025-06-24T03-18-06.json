Always be aware of hole locations and avoid accidental movements toward them.\n3.  **Use Boxes to Block or Fill Holes:** If a hole is in a strategic location, consider using a box to fill it, creating a safe path.\n4.  **Efficiency is Key:** With a limited time, minimize unnecessary movements and box pushes. Find the most direct route to each exit.\n\nI will first try to move towards the exit at row 7, col 1. It is to the left and down.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI'm moving the avatar left.
