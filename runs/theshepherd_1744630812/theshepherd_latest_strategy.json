  "strategy_description": "Optimized Sheep Herding with Treat Management and Path Optimization - Enhanced to prioritize converting scared sheep first, manage treat usage efficiently, and utilize dogs to guide sheep towards entry points while avoiding obstacles. This version includes specific pathing for the current level layout and prioritizes the closest sheep.",
  "implementation_guidance": "1. Collect the treat near the avatar. 2. Shoot the treat towards the hungry dog to convert it into a helpful dog. 3. Use the helpful dog to chase the closest scared sheep. 4. Guide the scared sheep towards the entry point once it becomes seeking. 5. Repeat the process for the remaining scared sheep, ensuring efficient treat usage and path optimization.",
  "long_term_plan": [
    "Step 1: Move the avatar to collect the treat located near it.",
    "Step 2: Position the avatar to shoot the treat towards the hungry dog.",
    "Step 3: Ensure the hungry dog catches the treat and becomes helpful.",
    "Step 4: Direct the helpful dog towards the closest scared sheep.",
    "Step 5: Allow the helpful dog to catch the scared sheep, converting it into a seeking sheep.",
    "Step 6: Guide the seeking sheep towards the nearest entry point.",
    "Step 7: Once the sheep reaches the entry point and becomes tamed, collect the treat again if available.",
    "Step 8: Repeat the process for the next closest scared sheep.",
    "Step 9: Monitor the movement of the helpful dog to ensure it doesn't get stuck or blocked by obstacles.",
    "Step 10: Continue the cycle until all scared sheep are converted and tamed."

  "anticipated_challenges": [
    "The single treat limitation may cause delays if the treat is not used efficiently.",
    "Obstacles like walls and fences may block the path of the sheep or dogs, requiring careful navigation.",
    "The helpful dog may revert to hungry state before catching all scared sheep, necessitating repeated treat usage."
  ],
  "success_metrics": [
    "All scared sheep are converted to seeking sheep.",
    "All seeking sheep reach the entry points and become tamed.",
    "The total score increases as sheep are tamed (5 points for scared sheep, 1 point for seeking sheep)."

  "fallback_strategy": "WaitnSee",
  "reasoning": "The current state shows multiple scared sheep and a treat near the avatar, making it optimal to use the treat to convert the hungry dog into a helpful dog. This strategy prioritizes converting scared sheep first due to their higher point value and utilizes the available resources efficiently. The path optimization ensures minimal movement and maximum efficiency in herding the sheep.",
  "new_insights": [
    "The treat is located near the avatar, making it easy to collect and use immediately.",
    "The hungry dog is positioned such that it can be easily targeted with the treat.",
    "The scared sheep are scattered but can be systematically herded towards the entry points with the help of the dog."
