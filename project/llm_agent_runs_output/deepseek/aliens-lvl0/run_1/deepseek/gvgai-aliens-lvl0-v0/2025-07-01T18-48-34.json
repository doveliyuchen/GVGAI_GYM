The player must protect it from bombs.\n5. **Portals:** No portals (`1` or `2`) are visible in the current state, suggesting they might be off-screen or already destroyed.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority:** Shoot aliens (+2 points) while avoiding collisions. The clustered aliens at the top are prime targets.\n- **Base Protection:** The missile is already in motion, so no immediate risk to the base. Avoid firing downward.\n- **Movement:** Since the avatar is near the center-bottom, moving left or right to align with alien clusters would optimize missile shots.\n\n### Action Decision:\n- **Optimal Action:** Move right (`ACTION_RIGHT`) to position the avatar under the densest alien groups (`col=3-4`, `col=7-8`, `col=11-12`). This maximizes chances to hit multiple aliens with upward missiles.\n- **Avoid:** Staying stationary (`ACTION_NIL`) or moving left (fewer targets to the left).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nMoving right should position the avatar closer to the alien clusters, enabling efficient upward shots while maintaining safe distance from bombs. The next action would likely be `ACTION_USE` to fire a missile.\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove right to align under dense alien clusters for optimal missile shots, while staying mobile to dodge potential bombs."

Some are clustered (e.g., col=16,17 and col=20,21), which could be dangerous if they drop bombs.\n3. **Base**: The base ('#') is spread across rows 1-2 and 7-9. The avatar is currently above a safe area (no base directly below at row=10, col=23).\n4. **Portals**: No portals ('1' or '2') are visible in the current state, suggesting they might be off-screen or already destroyed.\n5. **Threats**: The main threats are the aliens at the top. Bombs could drop from them, so the avatar should avoid staying directly below aliens for too long.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Prioritize Targets**: Shoot aliens to score points (+2 per alien) and reduce enemy numbers. The clustered aliens (e.g., col=16,17) are high-value targets.\n- **Protect the Base**: The avatar is not in immediate danger of colliding with the base, but missiles fired downward could hit it. Avoid firing downward.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is near the right edge (col=23 out of 29). Moving left might help avoid potential bombs from aliens on the right (col=28,29).\n\n### Action Decision:\n- **Action 1 (ACTION_USE)**: Fire a missile upward to target the aliens. Since the avatar is near the right edge, firing now can hit aliens above (e.g., col=20,21 or col=28,29).\n- **Follow-up Movement**: After firing, consider moving left (ACTION_LEFT) to reposition and avoid potential bombs.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nFiring a missile should hit one of the aliens above, scoring +2 points. The avatar is safe from immediate collision, and moving left afterward will reduce bomb risk.\n\n``` Action:1 ```  \nFiring a missile upward to target clustered aliens above, expecting to score +2 points and thin out enemy numbers."

This is near the bottom of the screen, which is good for base defense but limits upward missile range.\n\n2. **Threats**:\n   - Multiple AlienBlue (@) groups at rows 1-5, mostly clustered in the middle/right side.\n   - Bombs (&) are descending near the base at (7,20-21) and (8,20-21), which are immediate threats to the base.\n\n3. **Opportunities**:\n   - There's an active missile ($) at (4,22) heading upward, which may hit aliens.\n   - No visible portals in this snapshot, so focus is on clearing existing aliens.\n\n4. **Action Choice**:\n   - The bombs are close to hitting the base, so I should prioritize moving toward them to intercept.\n   - Since the avatar is currently at col=22 and bombs are at cols 20-21, moving LEFT would position me better to shoot the bombs.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n(ACTION_LEFT to move toward the bombs threatening the base, aiming to intercept them before they hit.) \n\n**Expected Outcome**: Moving left should position the avatar under the descending bombs, allowing me to shoot them down with a subsequent ACTION_USE (missile) before they hit the base. This aligns with the strategy of base protection and avoiding point loss."

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Player Position (Avatar 'a'):** Located at (row=10, col=22). This is near the bottom of the screen, which is a good position to defend the base (planet) and shoot upward at aliens.\n2. **Enemies:**\n   - Multiple **AlienBlue ('@')** are present in rows 1-5, mostly clustered around columns 16-17.\n   - **Bombs ('&' and '%')** are descending from aliens, particularly near columns 20-21 and 17-18.\n3. **Missile ('$'):** There is one missile at (row=2, col=22), already fired and moving upward.\n4. **Base ('#'):** The base is spread across rows 7-9, with some gaps. Bombs are approaching the base near columns 20-21 and 17-18.\n5. **Portals:** Not visible in the current state (likely off-screen or already destroyed).\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority:** Shoot aliens ('@') to score points (+2) and prevent them from dropping bombs.\n- **Danger:** Bombs near the base (columns 20-21 and 17-18) must be intercepted or avoided to prevent base damage.\n- **Movement:** The player is currently safe at (10,22), but should be ready to dodge bombs if they descend further.\n\n### Action Decision:\n- **ACTION_USE (1):** Fire a missile upward to target the cluster of aliens at (row=1-5, col=16-17). This aligns with the strategy of prioritizing aliens to reduce enemy count and prevent more bombs.\n- **No Movement Needed:** The current position is safe, and moving might expose the base to bombs.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Firing a missile should hit one of the aliens, earning +2 points and reducing enemy pressure. The existing missile (row=2, col=22) is already on its way, so this adds another projectile to clear aliens faster.\n\n``` Action:1 ```  \nFire a missile upward to target the alien cluster, aiming to score points and reduce bomb threats. Expect the missile to hit an alien (+2 points) or at least force aliens to change direction."
