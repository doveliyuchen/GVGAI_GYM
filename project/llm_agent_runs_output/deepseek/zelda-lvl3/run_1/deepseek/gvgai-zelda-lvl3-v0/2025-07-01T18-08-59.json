Alternatively, `g` (floor goal) might be the true goal, but it's not in the current map. Assuming `n` is the goal with an enemy on it.\n5. **Walls**: Surrounding the playable area, with some internal walls blocking paths.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority 1**: Get the key (`#`) first to transform into `withkey`.\n- **Priority 2**: Avoid or eliminate enemies, especially fast ones (`%` and `n`).\n- **Priority 3**: Reach the goal (`@` or `n`) after obtaining the key.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move left to pick up the key at `row=4, col=1`. The path is clear (no walls or enemies in the way).\n   - Current position: `row=4, col=3`.\n   - Next position: `row=4, col=2` (wall, cannot move there). Wait, no: `row=4, col=1` is the key, and `row=4, col=2` is a wall. So the key is adjacent to the left, but `row=4, col=2` is a wall. This suggests the key is at `row=4, col=1`, and the avatar is at `row=4, col=3`, so moving left twice should reach the key (first to `row=4, col=2`, then to `row=4, col=1`). But `row=4, col=2` is a wall, so this is impossible. Wait, the map shows:\n     - `row=4, col=1` -> `#` (key)\n     - `row=4, col=2` -> `w` (wall)\n     - `row=4, col=3` -> `*` (avatar)\n   - So the key is blocked by a wall. This contradicts the initial assumption. Rechecking:\n     - The key is at `row=4, col=1`, but the avatar is at `row=4, col=3`. To reach the key, the avatar must move left twice, but `row=4, col=2` is a wall. Thus, the key is inaccessible from the current position. This suggests a misinterpretation.\n   - Alternative interpretation: The avatar is `*` at `row=4, col=3`, and the key is `#` at `row=4, col=1`. There is a wall at `row=4, col=2`, so the key cannot be reached directly. The avatar must find another path.\n   - Possible path: Move up or down to go around the wall. Let's explore moving up:\n     - `row=3, col=3` is `.` (floor), then left to `row=3, col=2` (wall), so no. Moving right to `row=3, col=4` (wall), no. Moving down is back to start.\n   - Moving down: `row=5, col=3` is `.`, then left to `row=5, col=2` (`.`), then left to `row=5, col=1` (`w`). Still no path to the key.\n   - Conclusion: The key is unreachable in the current state, which suggests a mapping error or the key is not required (unlikely). Alternatively, the avatar might already have the key, but the sprite is `*` (nokey). This is confusing.\n\n### Re-evaluating:\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the avatar is `*` (nokey) and must reach `#` (key), but the path is blocked. Alternatively, `#` might not be the key, but another sprite. Rechecking the sprite mapping:\n- `#` is indeed the key.\n- `*` is nokey (avatar without key).\nThus, the key is at `row=4, col=1`, but the avatar cannot reach it due to the wall at `row=4, col=2`. This suggests the level is unsolvable as presented, which is unlikely. Perhaps the avatar can push blocks or use swords to clear walls, but the rules don't mention this.\n\n### Fallback Action:\nSince the key seems unreachable, the next best action is to avoid enemies and explore other paths. Move down to `row=5, col=3` (safe, no enemies nearby).\n\n``` Action:4 ```  \nMove DOWN to explore alternative paths and avoid nearby enemies (`$` at `row=4, col=5`). Expect to find a way around the wall blocking the key."

This is the primary objective to pick up before heading to the goal.\n3. **Goal Position**: The goal (`@`) is at (row=1, col=11). This is the final objective after obtaining the key.\n4. **Enemies**:\n   - `%` (monsterQuick) at (row=2, col=6) and (row=4, col=11). These are fast and dangerous.\n   - `$` (monsterNormal) at (row=5, col=4).\n   - `&` (monsterSlow) at (row=7, col=7). This is slow and less threatening.\n5. **Walls (`w`) and Path**: The level is surrounded by walls, with some internal walls blocking direct paths. The key is accessible by moving down and left from the avatar's position.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\n- **Step 1: Get the Key**  \n  The immediate goal is to reach the key at (4,1). From the avatar's position (2,3), the path is:\n  - Move **DOWN** to (3,3).\n  - Move **LEFT** to (3,2), but this is a wall (`w`), so this is invalid.\n  - Alternative path: Move **DOWN** to (3,3), then **DOWN** to (4,3), then **LEFT** to (4,2) (wall), then **LEFT** to (4,1) (key).\n\nHowever, there's a wall at (4,2), so the correct path is:\n- Move **DOWN** to (3,3).\n- Move **DOWN** to (4,3).\n- Move **LEFT** to (4,2) (wall, blocked).\n- Instead, move **LEFT** from (3,3) to (3,2) (wall, blocked).\n\nThis suggests the avatar cannot directly reach the key from its current position without encountering enemies or walls. Let's re-evaluate:\n- From (2,3), move **RIGHT** to (2,4), then **DOWN** to (3,4) (wall at (3,4)), which is invalid.\n- From (2,3), move **DOWN** to (3,3), then **RIGHT** to (3,4) (wall), invalid.\n- From (2,3), move **UP** to (1,3), then **LEFT** to (1,2), then **DOWN** to (2,2), then **LEFT** to (2,1), then **DOWN** to (3,1), then **LEFT** to (3,0) (wall), which is too convoluted.\n\nThis indicates the key is not directly reachable without passing near enemies. The safest immediate action is to move **DOWN** to (3,3) to avoid the fast enemy (`%`) at (2,6).\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:5 ```  \nMove **UP** to (1,3) to start navigating toward the key while avoiding the fast enemy at (2,6). This may not directly lead to the key but avoids immediate danger.  \n\n**Feedback**: Moving up to (1,3) avoids the fast enemy and opens a path to potentially loop around walls toward the key.

Wait, the key is at (4,1), and the avatar is at (3,3).

There must be another way.\n\nWait, looking again:\n- From (3,3), move RIGHT to (3,4) (wall at (3,4)? No, (3,4) is `w` (wall), so cannot go right.\n- From (3,3), the only possible move is DOWN to (4,3).

From the avatar's position (5,4), the path is:\n  - Move LEFT (from 5,4 to 5,3).\n  - Move UP (from 5,3 to 4,3).\n  - Move LEFT (from 4,3 to 4,2). This is a wall (`w`), so this path is blocked.\n  - Alternative path: From (5,4), move UP to (4,4), then LEFT to (4,3), then LEFT to (4,2) (wall), which is also blocked.\n  - Correct path: From (5,4), move LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (4,3), then LEFT to (4,2) (wall), but this is invalid.  \n  **Correction**: The only viable path is from (5,4), move UP to (4,4), then LEFT to (4,3), then UP to (3,3), then LEFT to (3,2) (wall), which is also blocked.  \n  **Realization**: The key is actually directly accessible by moving LEFT from (5,4) to (5,3), then UP to (4,3), then LEFT to (4,2) (wall). This suggests the key is behind a wall, which contradicts the initial observation.  \n  **Re-evaluation**: The key is at (4,1), and the avatar is at (5,4). The path is:\n  - Move LEFT to (5,3).\n  - Move UP to (4,3).\n  - Move LEFT to (4,2) (wall). This is blocked.  \n  **Conclusion**: The key is not directly reachable from the current position. The avatar must find another path, possibly involving moving RIGHT first to go around the walls.\n\n### Revised Plan:\nFrom (5,4):\n1. Move RIGHT to (5,5).  \n   - This avoids the wall at (4,2) and opens a path to loop around.\n2. From (5,5), move UP to (4,5), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (3,4), then LEFT to (3,3), then DOWN to (4,3), then LEFT to (4,2) (wall). Still blocked.  \n   **Alternative**: From (5,4), move UP to (4,4), then LEFT to (4,3), then UP to (3,3), then RIGHT to (3,4), then UP to (2,4), then LEFT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3), etc. This seems too convoluted.  \n   **Final Decision**: The key is likely reachable by moving LEFT from (5,4) to (5,3), then UP to (4,3), then LEFT to (4,2) (wall). Since this is blocked, the game may allow diagonal movement or another mechanic (e.g., pushing blocks). However, the rules don't mention diagonal movement, and `+` (movable blocks) are not present near the key.  \n\n### Action Choice:\nGiven the confusion, the safest first move is to move LEFT to (5,3) to explore the path toward the key. If the avatar doesn't move, it means the path is blocked, and we must try another direction.\n\n``` Action:2 ```  \nAttempting to move LEFT to (5,3) to approach the key. If blocked, will adjust strategy next turn.  \n\n**Feedback**: Expect to move closer to the key at (4,1). If blocked by a wall, will need to find an alternative route."
