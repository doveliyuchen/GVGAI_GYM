However, the aliens are spread out, so the player may need to move left or right to target them effectively.\n- **Action Choice**: Since the avatar is stationary, the first action should likely be to fire a missile (`ACTION_USE`) to start eliminating aliens. If the avatar needs to reposition, a directional action (`ACTION_LEFT` or `ACTION_RIGHT`) can follow.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the spread of aliens, the most urgent targets are the ones closest to the base (row=0, cols=0,1,4,10,11). The avatar is currently aligned with col=7, which is between two groups of aliens (cols 0-4 and cols 10-11). \n\n1. **First Action**: Fire a missile to target the nearest alien group. Since the avatar is centered, it can likely hit aliens moving down the middle.\n   - **Action**: `ACTION_USE` (fire missile).\n   - **Expectation**: The missile will travel upward and hopefully hit one of the aliens, reducing the threat to the base.\n\n### Next Steps:\nAfter firing, observe if the missile hits an alien and whether the avatar needs to reposition to target other aliens. If the avatar's position doesn't change, consider moving left or right to align with more aliens.\n\n``` Action:1 ```  \nFiring a missile to target incoming aliens, expecting to reduce the threat to the base and score points.
