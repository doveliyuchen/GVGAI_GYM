The bombs at row=2/3, col=26/27 are descending and could hit the avatar if it stays near col=19-20.\n- **Priority 2**: Shoot aliens. The missile already in flight (row=6, col=19) will likely hit aliens above. Another shot may not be needed immediately.\n- **Priority 3**: Move to a safer position to dodge bombs. The avatar is currently stationary (no recent movement noted).\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe closest bomb is at row=3, col=26 (moving downward). The avatar is at col=19, so the bomb is to the right. To avoid it:\n- Move **left** (away from the bomb's trajectory) to col=18 or further.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:2 ```  \n(ACTION_LEFT to move away from the bomb's path and reposition for better defense.)  \n**Feedback**: Moving left should dodge the descending bomb and position the avatar to fire at incoming aliens from a safer location.

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Player Position**: The avatar ('a') is at (row=10, col=1). This is near the bottom-left of the screen.\n2. **Enemies**: There are four alienGreen ('@') at positions (6,0), (6,1), (7,0), and (7,1). They are clustered in the top-left corner.\n3. **Base**: The base ('#') is at (8,3) and (8,4), with a sam ('$') above it at (9,2).\n4. **Projectiles**: One sam ('$') is already in flight at (9,2), likely fired by the player earlier.\n5. **Threats**: No bombs ('%' or '&') are visible yet, but the aliens are positioned such that they could drop bombs soon.\n6. **Portals**: No portals ('1' or '2') are visible in the current state, so no new enemies are spawning at the moment.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority**: Shoot aliens ('@') to earn points (+2 per hit) and reduce threats. The clustered aliens in the top-left are the immediate threat.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is at the far left. Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) would position it better to shoot upward at the aliens.\n- **Shooting**: After repositioning, firing (ACTION_USE) is critical to eliminate the aliens before they drop bombs or reach the base.\n\n### Action Choice:\nSince the avatar is at the far left, moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) will help center it for better shooting angles. The sam already in flight may hit one alien, but more shots are needed to clear the cluster.\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \n*Moving right to position the avatar for better shooting angles at the clustered aliens. Expect to fire next turn if the position changes.*  \n\n(Note: If the avatar doesn't move after this action, the next step would be to fire (ACTION_USE) or repeat the movement to confirm rotation.)"

The avatar should reposition to avoid potential bombs or collisions.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince the missile is already in motion and the aliens are clustered, the best action is to **move left or right** to prepare for future threats. Given that the avatar is near the left edge (col=2), moving **right** would provide more space to maneuver.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:3 ```  \n**Feedback:** Moving right to reposition the avatar for better coverage and to avoid potential bombs from the aliens. Expect to see the avatar shift rightward, maintaining a safer distance from the alien cluster."
