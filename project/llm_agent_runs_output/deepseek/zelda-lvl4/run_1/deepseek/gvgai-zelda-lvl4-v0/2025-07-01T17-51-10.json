The key is accessible via a clear path to the right of the avatar, but the quick enemy (`%`) is nearby.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Priority**: Collect the key (`#`) first to unlock the goal (`@`). The key is nearby (right of the avatar), but the quick enemy (`%`) is a threat.\n- **Enemy Threat**: The quick enemy (`%`) at `row=7, col=10` is dangerous. If it moves toward the avatar, it could cause a score penalty (-1). \n- **Sword Use**: The sword has limited uses (5), so avoid unnecessary combat. However, the quick enemy is too close to ignore.\n- **Path to Key**: The direct path to the key is clear (right direction), but the quick enemy is adjacent. \n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Kill the Quick Enemy First**: Use the sword (`ACTION_USE`) to eliminate the quick enemy (`%`) at `row=7, col=10` before it moves closer. This prevents a score penalty and clears the path to the key.\n2. **Move Toward the Key**: After killing the enemy, move right (`ACTION_RIGHT`) to collect the key.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe quick enemy (`%`) is adjacent to the avatar's right (at `row=7, col=10`). The avatar is at `row=7, col=1`, so the enemy is not directly next to the avatar yet, but it is in the same row and could move quickly. To preemptively eliminate the threat, the avatar should move right toward the key and be ready to use the sword if the enemy approaches.\n\nHowever, the quick enemy is at `col=10`, and the avatar is at `col=1`, so it is not immediately adjacent. The correct move is to start moving right toward the key (`ACTION_RIGHT`), as the enemy is not yet in attack range.\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove right toward the key, avoiding unnecessary combat unless the quick enemy approaches. Expect to progress toward the key while monitoring enemy movement."

We need the key first.\n4. **Enemies**:\n   - A `monsterNormal` (`$`) is at (row=3, col=4) and (row=7, col=11).\n   - A `monsterQuick` (`%`) is at (row=3, col=8).\n5. **Obstacles**: Walls (`w`) surround the map, and there are internal walls blocking some paths. The key is accessible by moving right twice from the avatar's position.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Priority**: Collect the key first (move right twice to (row=7, col=6)).\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: The `monsterQuick` at (row=3, col=8) is far away and not an immediate threat. The `monsterNormal` at (row=7, col=11) is closer but not in the direct path to the key.\n- **Path**: Move right twice to reach the key. No enemies are blocking this path.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move right to (row=7, col=5). This is a wall, but the key is at (row=7, col=6), so the first move should be to (row=7, col=5), which is a floor (`.`). Wait, no: the avatar is at (row=7, col=4), and (row=7, col=5) is `w` (wall). Oops! The key is at (row=7, col=6), but (row=7, col=5) is a wall. This means we cannot move directly right to the key. We need an alternate path.\n\n### Re-evaluating Path:\nLooking at the map:\n- From (row=7, col=4), moving up to (row=6, col=4) is possible (`.` floor).\n- Then, from (row=6, col=4), we can move right to (row=6, col=5) (wall), but that's blocked.\n- Alternatively, from (row=6, col=4), move up to (row=5, col=4) (`.` floor), then right to (row=5, col=5) (`.` floor), then down to (row=6, col=5) (wall), but that's blocked.\n- Another option: from (row=7, col=4), move down is not possible (row=8 is all walls).\n- From (row=7, col=4), move left to (row=7, col=3) (`.` floor), then up to (row=6, col=3) (`.` floor), then right to (row=6, col=4) (`.` floor), then up to (row=5, col=4) (`.` floor), then right to (row=5, col=5) (`.` floor), then down to (row=6, col=5) (wall), but blocked.\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the key is not reachable directly, but the map suggests it is. Let me re-examine:\n- The key is at (row=7, col=6), and (row=7, col=5) is `w` (wall). So the key is blocked by a wall. Is there another way? Maybe the key is accessible from below, but row=8 is all walls. This seems like a dead end. \n\n### Possible Misinterpretation:\nWait, the sprite mapping says `floor key -> '+'`, but the key in the map is `#`. Is `#` the key? The mapping says `key -> '#'`, so yes, `#` is the key. But it's blocked by a wall at (row=7, col=5). This seems like a level design issue unless there's another path.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nPerhaps the avatar can push the wall? But the rules say walls block movement, and only \"movable\" objects can be pushed (not mentioned in the map). This seems like a dead end. Maybe the key is reachable from another direction, but the map doesn't show it.\n\n### Final Decision:\nGiven the current map, the key seems inaccessible due to the wall at (row=7, col=5). However, since the key is a primary objective, I must assume there's a way to reach it. Maybe the wall at (row=7, col=5) is a typo or the avatar can interact with it. I'll try moving right to see if the wall can be bypassed or if it's a mapping error.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nAttempting to move right to (row=7, col=5) to test if the wall can be bypassed or if the key is reachable. Expectation: If the wall blocks, the avatar won't move, and I'll need to find another path. If it moves, the key is reachable. \n\n(Note: If the action fails, the next step would be to explore upward or leftward to find an alternate route, but the map suggests the key is blocked.)"

The one at (row=5, col=6) is closer to the key but not directly in the path.\n4. **Goal**: The goal (`@`) is at (row=1, col=10), but the player cannot reach it without the key.\n5. **Walls and Paths**: The path to the key is straightforward: move right twice from the avatar's position (to col=6). There are no walls blocking this path.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority**: Collect the key first (`+1 point`), then proceed to the goal.\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: The `monsterNormal` at (row=5, col=6) is nearby but not directly in the path to the key. The `monsterQuick` is far away and not an immediate threat.\n- **Sword Use**: Avoid using the sword unless absolutely necessary (only 5 uses). No need to engage enemies here.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move right twice to reach the key at (row=7, col=6). \n   - First, rotate right (if needed) and then move right. \n   - Verify if the avatar moves after the first `ACTION_RIGHT`. If not, send `ACTION_RIGHT` again to confirm movement.\n\n### First Action:\n``` Action:3 ```  \n(ACTION_RIGHT to start moving toward the key. Expectation: Avatar moves from (7,4) to (7,5) or rotates right if position doesn't change.)  \n\nFeedback: If the avatar does not move, the next action will be `ACTION_RIGHT` again to confirm movement. If it moves, proceed to the next step.  \n\n### Next Steps:\nAfter reaching (7,5), send `ACTION_RIGHT` again to reach the key at (7,6). Once the key is collected, plan a path to the goal (`@`).  \n\nWould you like to proceed step-by-step or see the full path to the goal after key collection?  \n\n(Note: The current action is `ACTION_RIGHT` to initiate movement toward the key.)  \n\n``` Action:3 ```  \n(Expectation: Avatar moves right toward the key, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing key collection while avoiding unnecessary combat.)"

This avoids immediate enemy contact and gives more options for subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action:5 ``` \nMoving UP to (6,4) to begin navigating around the wall toward the key while avoiding enemies.

Let me correct:\n\nThe immediate right at (7,5) is a wall, so we cannot go right directly. We need to:\n1. Go UP to (6,4)\n2. Then RIGHT to (6,5) (wall - blocked)\n3. Alternative: Go UP to (6,4), then UP to (5,4), then RIGHT to (5,5) (enemy - risky)\n4. Better alternative: Go LEFT to (7,3), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (6,6), then DOWN to (7,6)\n\nBut the quickest safe path seems to be:\n1. LEFT to (7,3)\n2. UP to (6,3)\n3. RIGHT to (6,6)\n4. DOWN to (7,6) to get key\n\nFirst action should be LEFT to move away from the wall.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving LEFT to (7,3) to start navigating around the wall toward the key, following the strategy of prioritizing key collection while avoiding unnecessary enemy contact."

The one at (row=7, col=3) is directly to the left of the avatar and poses an immediate threat.\n   - A `monsterQuick` (`%`) is at (row=1, col=11), far from the avatar for now.\n4. **Goal**: The goal (`@`) is at (row=1, col=10), but we need the key first.\n5. **Walls**: The path to the key is blocked by a wall to the immediate right (row=7, col=5 is `w`), so we cannot move directly right to the key.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Priority**: Collect the key first, then proceed to the goal.\n- **Immediate Threat**: The `monsterNormal` at (row=7, col=3) is adjacent to the avatar (left side). If we don't act, it might move into the avatar next turn, causing a score penalty.\n- **Path to Key**: \n  - The direct path right is blocked by a wall. \n  - Alternative path: Move down to (row=8, col=4) is blocked by a wall. \n  - Move up to (row=6, col=4) is possible, then right to (row=6, col=6), then down to (row=7, col=6) to get the key.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Avoid Enemy**: The `monsterNormal` to the left is dangerous. We can either:\n   - Kill it with the sword (but sword uses are limited, and this enemy is not fast).\n   - Move away from it (up is safe for now).\n2. **Move Toward Key**: Move up to (row=6, col=4), then proceed right and down to the key.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the enemy is to the left, moving up (away from it) is the safest choice. \n\n``` Action:5 ```  \n(ACTION_UP to move to (row=6, col=4)).
