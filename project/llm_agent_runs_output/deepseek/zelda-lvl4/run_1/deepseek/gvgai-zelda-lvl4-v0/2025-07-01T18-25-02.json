This is the highest priority.\n- **Avoid Enemies**: The `monsterQuick` is nearby, so we should avoid unnecessary combat until we have the key.\n- **Path to Key**: From (7,4), the key is at (7,6). The path is clear:\n  - Move RIGHT to (7,5) (a wall is at (7,5), but the key is at (7,6), so this seems incorrect. Wait, looking again: (7,5) is a wall (`w`), so we cannot go right directly. We need to find another path.\n  - Alternative path: From (7,4), move UP to (6,4), then RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (7,5) (but (7,5) is a wall, so this won't work.\n  - Another path: From (7,4), move DOWN to (8,4), but (8,4) is a wall (`w`), so this is invalid.\n  - Wait, the only possible move from (7,4) is LEFT to (7,3), but the key is to the right. This suggests the map might be more complex than it appears, or there might be a hidden path.\n\nWait, looking again:\n- At (7,4), the possible moves are:\n  - LEFT to (7,3): `.` (floor), safe.\n  - RIGHT to (7,5): `w` (wall), blocked.\n  - UP to (6,4): `.` (floor), safe.\n  - DOWN to (8,4): `w` (wall), blocked.\nSo, from (7,4), we can go LEFT or UP.\n\nBut the key is at (7,6), which is to the right.

This aligns with the \"Key First\" strategy.\n- **Combat Carefully**: The quick monster (`%`) is close but not directly in the path to the key. The normal monsters (`$`) are further away and can be avoided for now.\n- **Avoid Unnecessary Fights**: The path to the key is clear, so fighting is not immediately necessary.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move right twice to reach the key (`row=7, col=6`). \n   - First, move right to `row=7, col=5` (this is a wall, but the key is at `row=7, col=6`). Wait, no: `row=7, col=5` is a wall (`w`), so moving right from `row=7, col=4` would hit the wall. This is a problem.\n   - Alternative: The key is at `row=7, col=6`, but `row=7, col=5` is a wall. So the key is blocked by a wall. This means we need to find another path to the key.\n\n### Re-evaluating Path to Key:\nLooking at the map:\n- From `row=7, col=4`, moving up to `row=6, col=4` is possible (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=6, col=4`, moving right to `row=6, col=5` is a wall (`w`), so no.\n- From `row=6, col=4`, moving left to `row=6, col=3` is possible (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=6, col=3`, moving down to `row=7, col=3` is possible (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=7, col=3`, moving right to `row=7, col=4` is the avatar's starting position. This is a loop.\n\nAlternative path:\n- From `row=7, col=4`, move down: but `row=8, col=4` is a wall (`w`).\n- From `row=7, col=4`, move left to `row=7, col=3` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=7, col=3`, move up to `row=6, col=3` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=6, col=3`, move left to `row=6, col=2` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=6, col=2`, move up to `row=5, col=2` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=5, col=2`, move right to `row=5, col=3` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=5, col=3`, move right to `row=5, col=4` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=5, col=4`, move right to `row=5, col=5` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=5, col=5`, move down to `row=6, col=5` (wall `w`), no.\n- From `row=5, col=5`, move right to `row=5, col=6` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=5, col=6`, move down to `row=6, col=6` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=6, col=6`, move right to `row=6, col=7` (`.` is floor).\n- From `row=6, col=7`, move down to `row=7, col=7` (`.` is floor, and the key is at `row=7, col=6`). Wait, this doesn't reach the key.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe the key is unreachable due to walls, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the key is reachable by moving right from `row=7, col=4` to `row=7, col=5` (wall), but the key is at `row=7, col=6`. This suggests the key is behind a wall, which contradicts the game's design (keys should be reachable).\n\n### Possible Misinterpretation:\nLooking back at the sprite mapping:\n- `floor key` is `+`, but `key` is `#`. The key at `row=7, col=6` is `#`, which is `key`, not `floor key`. So perhaps `#` is the key pickup, and `+` is something else (maybe the sword pickup). \n\nGiven that, the key is at `row=7, col=6`, and the avatar is at `row=7, col=4`. The path is blocked by a wall at `row=7, col=5`. This seems like a level design issue, but perhaps there's another way.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nMaybe the avatar can shoot swords to break walls or enemies. The rules mention:\n- `ShootAvatar` with `stype=sword`, and swords disappear after hitting enemies or walls. But it doesn't say walls are destroyed, just that swords disappear. So likely walls are indestructible.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe key seems unreachable due to a wall blocking the direct path. This might be a level generation error, or perhaps the key is meant to be reached from another direction. Given the current state, the best action is to move away from the quick monster (`%` at `row=6, col=8`) and explore other paths.\n\n### Action:\nMove left to `row=7, col=3` to avoid the quick monster and explore alternative paths.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nMoving left to avoid the quick monster and explore alternative paths to the key. Expectation: The avatar moves left to `row=7, col=3` safely."

Here's a possible path:\n- From `(5,1)`, move **UP** to `(4,1)` (open floor).\n- Then move **RIGHT** to `(4,2)` (open floor).\n- Continue **RIGHT** to `(4,3)` (wall blocked), so instead go **UP** to `(3,2)`.\n- From `(3,2)`, move **RIGHT** to `(3,3)` and then `(3,4)` (open floor).\n- Then move **UP** to `(2,4)` (wall), so go **RIGHT** to `(3,5)` (wall), then **UP** to `(2,5)` (wall). This suggests a detour is needed.\n- Alternative: From `(3,4)`, go **UP** to `(2,4)` (wall), so instead go **RIGHT** to `(3,5)` (wall), then **DOWN** to `(4,4)` (wall). This area is tricky; the correct path is likely:\n  - From `(3,4)`, go **UP** to `(2,4)` (wall), so instead go **LEFT** to `(3,3)`, then **UP** to `(2,3)` (open floor).\n  - From `(2,3)`, go **RIGHT** to `(2,4)` (wall), so go **UP** to `(1,3)` (open floor).\n  - From `(1,3)`, go **RIGHT** to `(1,4)` (open floor), then `(1,5)` (wall), so go **UP** to `(0,4)` (wall), then **RIGHT** to `(1,6)` (open floor).\n  - Continue this way toward the goal.\n\nHowever, this is complex. A simpler approach is:\n1. Move **UP** from `(5,1)` to `(4,1)`.\n2. Move **RIGHT** to `(4,2)`.\n3. Move **UP** to `(3,2)`.\n4. Move **RIGHT** to `(3,3)`.\n5. Move **UP** to `(2,3)`.\n6. Move **RIGHT** to `(2,4)` (wall), so go **UP** to `(1,3)`.\n7. Move **RIGHT** to `(1,4)`, then `(1,5)` (wall), then `(1,6)` (open floor).\n8. Continue right to `(1,7)`, `(1,8)`, then `(1,9)` (monsterNormal). Here, either fight or avoid the monster.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe first step is to move **UP** from `(5,1)` to `(4,1)`. This is safe (no enemies nearby).\n\n``` Action:5 ```  \n(ACTION_UP to move from `(5,1)` to `(4,1)`).  \n**Feedback**: Moving upward to start navigating toward the goal while avoiding nearby enemies. The next step will likely involve moving right or further up."

From the mapping, `nokey` is `&`, but it's not present. The closest is `s` (sword withkey), but since we start as `nokey`, the avatar is likely at `A` (floor nokey). However, `A` is not in the state either. This is confusing. Let's assume the avatar is at an unlisted position or hidden. For now, we'll proceed with the assumption that the avatar is at `row=1, col=1` (`.`), as it's a floor tile near the start.\n\n2. **Key (`+`)**: The key is represented by `+` in the mapping, but it's not listed in the current state. The `key` is `#`, but it's also not present. This suggests the key might already be picked up or not spawned yet. The `s` (sword withkey) at `row=1, col=3` implies the avatar might already have the key (`withkey`), but we start as `nokey`. This is inconsistent.

Alternatively, `s` might be a pickup.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Locate the Key**: Since the key is not visible in the state, we might already have it (if `s` implies `withkey`).

The sword at (row=1, col=5) is blocked by a wall (`d`), so it cannot be picked up.\n- The safest option is to move toward the goal and try to dodge the enemy. If the enemy moves randomly, there is a chance it may move away.\n\n### Action Choice:\n- Move right (ACTION_RIGHT) toward the goal. If the enemy does not block the path, proceed. If the enemy blocks, reassess.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- The avatar will move right to (row=1, col=5). If the enemy does not interfere, continue moving right toward the goal. If the enemy blocks, the next action may involve attacking (if a sword is available) or changing direction.\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove right toward the goal, hoping the fast enemy does not intercept.

From the sprite mapping, `goal` is `@`, but it's not listed in the current state. However, the `goal monsterQuick` (`c`) is at (row=1, col=10), which might be a goal with an enemy nearby.  \n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A `monsterQuick` (`c`) is at (row=1, col=10).  \n   - A `monsterNormal` (`$`) is at (row=2, col=7).  \n   - Another `monsterNormal` (`$`) is at (row=6, col=1).  \n4. **Walls**: The map is surrounded by walls (`w`), with internal walls forming a maze.  \n5. **Key**: The player already has the key (`*`), so the next step is to reach the goal.  \n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- Since the player already has the key (`withkey`), the priority is to **reach the goal** while avoiding or defeating enemies.  \n- The `monsterQuick` (`c`) at (row=1, col=10) is near the top-right corner, which might be close to the goal (assuming the goal is in that direction).  \n- The player should move cautiously toward the goal, avoiding unnecessary fights or using swords to clear paths if needed.  \n\n### Possible Actions:\n- The player is at (1,4).

Another option: From (row=2, col=3), move **DOWN** to (row=3, col=3), then **RIGHT** to (row=3, col=4), and then **UP** to (row=2, col=4), but this is a wall. This path seems blocked.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe safest immediate action is to move **UP** to (row=1, col=3), then reassess. This avoids the enemy at (row=1, col=4) for now and gets closer to the goal.\n\n``` Action:5 ```\n**Feedback**: Moving UP to (row=1, col=3) to get closer to the goal while avoiding immediate enemy contact. Expect to reassess the path after this move."

This means the player already has the key and can now aim for the goal.\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (`@`) is at (row=1, col=10). It is to the right of the avatar but blocked by walls and enemies.\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A `monsterNormal` (`$`) is at (row=1, col=4) and (row=1, col=9), close to the avatar and the goal.\n   - A `monsterQuick` (`%`) is at (row=7, col=11), which is far from the current position but could be a threat if the player moves downward.\n4. **Walls**: The maze is tightly packed with walls, and the path to the goal is not straightforward. The player must navigate around walls and avoid or defeat enemies.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- Since the player already has the key (`withkey`), the priority is to reach the goal (`@`) while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n- The goal is to the right (col=10), but the direct path is blocked by a wall (row=1, col=5) and enemies. The player must find an alternative route.\n- The map suggests a possible path downward (row=2, col=3) and then rightward to loop around the walls.\n\n### Next Action:\nTo move toward the goal, the player should first move downward to avoid the `monsterNormal` at (row=1, col=4) and start navigating around the walls. \n\n``` Action:5 ``` (ACTION_UP) is incorrect here because the goal is to the right, and moving up would not help. Instead, the correct action is:\n``` Action:4 ``` (ACTION_DOWN). This should move the avatar to (row=2, col=3), opening a path to loop around the walls toward the goal.\n\n**Feedback**: Moving down should allow the avatar to start navigating around the walls and avoid the nearby `monsterNormal`. The next steps will involve moving right and then up to approach the goal."

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar (`*`) is at (row=1, col=3). The `*` symbol indicates the avatar is holding the key (`withkey`), so the next objective is to reach the goal (`@`) at (row=1, col=10).\n2. **Obstacles & Enemies**:\n   - Two `monsterNormal` enemies (`$`) are nearby at (1,4) and (1,9).\n   - A `monsterQuick` (`%`) is at (7,11), but it's far away and not an immediate threat.\n   - Walls (`w`) block direct paths, so navigation requires careful movement.\n3. **Goal Accessibility**: The goal (`@`) is at (1,10), but there's a `monsterNormal` (`$`) at (1,9) blocking the path. The player must either defeat the enemy or find a way around it.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- The priority is to reach the goal (`@`) since the key is already collected.\n- Combat is risky (enemies reduce score and may kill the avatar), so dodging is preferable if possible.\n- The path to the goal is partially blocked by a `monsterNormal` at (1,9). The player can:\n  - Try to move toward the goal and kill the enemy if necessary (using `ACTION_USE` to shoot swords).\n  - Alternatively, take a longer path around the walls to avoid the enemy.\n\n### Immediate Action Plan:\n- The most direct path to the goal is to the right (col=4 to col=10). However, the enemy at (1,9) is in the way.\n- Since the player is already facing the right direction (assuming default orientation after movement), the next step is to move right and engage the enemy if needed.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove RIGHT toward the goal, expecting to encounter the `monsterNormal` at (1,9). If the enemy blocks the path, the next action will involve attacking or repositioning.  \n\n**Feedback**: Moving right aligns with the goal of reaching `@` at (1,10). If the enemy is encountered, the next step will involve combat or evasion."
