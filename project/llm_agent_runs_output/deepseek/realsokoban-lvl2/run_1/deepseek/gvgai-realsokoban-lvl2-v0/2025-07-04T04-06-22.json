However, looking at the map, (1,3) is a bbox ('.') which would bounce me forward. \n\nAlternative better approach:\nMove LEFT to (2,2) - but that's a hole, can't go there.\nMove RIGHT to (2,4) - that's a hole, can't go there.\nMove DOWN to (3,3) - that's a boxin ('%'), can't go there.\n\nActually, the only safe move is UP to (1,3), which is a bbox that will bounce me forward to (0,3) - but (0,3) is a wall ('$'), so I'll bounce back to (2,3). This won't make progress.\n\nWait, looking again - the box at (3,5) could be pushed left towards hole (4,4), but it's already a boxin there. Alternatively, push it up towards (2,4) hole.\n\nTo reach (3,5), I should move DOWN to (3,3) but that's occupied by boxin. \n\nAlternative plan: Move RIGHT to (2,4) - but that's a hole.
