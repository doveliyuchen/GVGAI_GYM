However, staying mobile is important to avoid future bombs.\n\n4. **Action Choice**: \n   - `ACTION_USE` (1) is the best immediate action to fire a missile upward at the aliens.

The base is represented by '#' symbols at the bottom rows (rows 1, 2, 8, 9). \n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. **Prioritize Shooting Aliens**: The immediate threat is the AlienBlue entities descending from the top. They must be shot down before they reach the base.\n2. **Positioning**: The avatar is currently near the center (col=11). Moving left or right to align with the aliens and firing missiles (ACTION_USE) is the best course of action.\n3. **No Bombers Visible**: There are no Bomber aliens or bombs in the current state, so the focus is on the descending AlienBlue entities.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:1 ```  \nI will fire a missile (ACTION_USE) to shoot down the nearest AlienBlue entities. Since the avatar is centered, this should help clear some of the incoming threats. If the position doesn't change, I will adjust by moving left or right to better align with the aliens.  \n\n**Expectation**: The missile should destroy one or more AlienBlue entities, reducing the threat to the base. If no aliens are hit, I will reposition and fire again."

The closest aliens are at row=0, col=4, 12, 16, 17.\n2. **Move horizontally** to position the avatar under the aliens to shoot them efficiently.\n3. **Avoid staying still** to dodge potential bombs from bombers (though none are visible in this state).\n\n### Action:\nThe avatar is currently at col=11.

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar ('a') is at row=10, col=12. This is near the bottom of the screen, which is good for defending the base ('#') located at row=5, col=7 and other positions (e.g., row=8, col=2-3, etc.).\n2. **Enemies**: \n   - Multiple AlienBlue ('@') are present in rows 0-2, moving downward. Some are clustered (e.g., row=0, col=0-1 and col=5-6).\n   - Bombs ('&') are at row=7, col=13-14 and row=8, col=13-14, moving downward toward the base.\n3. **Projectiles**: \n   - A SAM ('$') is at row=0, col=13, moving upward. This might already be targeting an alien.\n4. **Base**: The base is intact but threatened by bombs and aliens. The bombs are close (rows 7-8) and need immediate attention.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority 1**: Destroy bombs ('&') before they hit the base.\n- **Priority 2**: Shoot down aliens ('@') closest to the base or in large groups.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is centered horizontally (col=12). To intercept bombs, moving left (toward col=13-14) is optimal.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove RIGHT to position the avatar under the bombs at col=13-14 and fire upward (ACTION_USE next) to destroy them before they reach the base. This aligns with the strategy of defending the base as the top priority.  \n\n**Feedback**: Expect the avatar to move right toward the bombs, setting up for a clear shot to neutralize the immediate threat to the base. If position doesn't change (due to rotation), I'll press RIGHT again next turn."

This is near the center of the bottom area, close to the base ('#' at row=5, col=7 and others scattered around row=8-9).\n2. **Enemies**: Multiple AlienBlue ('@') are present at the top (rows 0-2), moving downward. Bombs ('&') are present at row=8, cols 13-14, descending toward the base.\n3. **Base**: The base is fragmented (multiple '#' symbols at row=8-9), but the main central base is at row=5, col=7.\n4. **Threats**: \n   - Bombs at row=8, cols 13-14 are the most immediate threat to the base (directly above the central base).\n   - Aliens are still high up but will eventually reach the base if not stopped.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority**: Destroy bombs first to protect the base, then focus on aliens and portals (though no portals are visible in this state).\n- **Movement**: The avatar is centered, so moving left or right to align with the bombs is critical.\n- **Action**: Fire missiles (ACTION_USE) while positioning to intercept bombs.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe bombs are at cols 13-14, and the avatar is at col=13. The avatar is directly below one of the bombs, so firing upward should intercept it. However, if the avatar doesn't move, it risks being hit by the bomb or failing to intercept both bombs.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:1 ```  \nFire a missile (SAM) upward to intercept the bomb at (row=8, col=13). Expectation: The missile will destroy the bomb, preventing it from hitting the base. If the avatar doesn't move next turn, I will reposition to handle the second bomb or incoming aliens.  \n\n### Follow-up Plan:\n- If the bomb is destroyed, move left or right to dodge the second bomb or target aliens.\n- If the bomb is not destroyed, reposition immediately (ACTION_LEFT or ACTION_RIGHT) to avoid collision."

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar ('a') is at row=10, col=13. This is near the bottom of the screen, just above the base (which is at row=5, col=7 and row=8, col=2-3, etc.).\n2. **Enemies**: There are multiple AlienBlue ('@') at the top (rows 0-2). Some are clustered (e.g., col=1-2, col=6-7, etc.), and others are spread out. No Bombers or bombs are visible in the immediate vicinity of the avatar.\n3. **Projectiles**: \n   - A bomb ('&') is at row=9, col=14 (directly above the avatar's position). This is a threat to the base if it continues downward.\n   - A SAM ('*') is at row=9, col=13 (just above the avatar). This might be a player-fired projectile, but it's unclear if it's moving upward.\n4. **Base**: The base is represented by '#' symbols at multiple positions (e.g., row=8, col=2-3; row=5, col=7). The bomb at row=9, col=14 is heading toward the base area.\n5. **Portals**: Not explicitly visible in the current state (no '1' or '2' symbols), suggesting they might be off-screen or already destroyed.\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n- The bomb at row=9, col=14 is the most pressing threat, as it is close to the base and the avatar. If not intercepted, it could destroy the base or the avatar if they collide.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority**: Destroy the bomb first (defensive action to protect the base).\n- **Movement**: The avatar is currently at col=13, and the bomb is at col=14. The avatar needs to move right to align with the bomb and fire a SAM upward to intercept it.\n- **Action Plan**: \n  1. Move right to col=14 (ACTION_RIGHT).\n  2. Fire a SAM (ACTION_USE) to destroy the bomb.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:3 ```  \n(ACTION_RIGHT to move toward the bomb's column).  \n**Feedback**: Expect the avatar to move right to col=14, aligning with the bomb for interception. Next action should be ACTION_USE to fire a SAM.  \n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If the avatar doesn't move after ACTION_RIGHT, it might need to be issued again (due to rotation mechanics).  \n- After destroying the bomb, focus on clearing AlienBlue clusters at the top to reduce pressure on the base.  \n- No portals are visible, so the current goal is survival and bomb interception."
