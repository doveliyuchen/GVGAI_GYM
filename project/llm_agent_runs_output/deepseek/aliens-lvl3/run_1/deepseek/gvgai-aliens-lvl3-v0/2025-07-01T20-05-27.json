Moving left would position it better to intercept aliens.  \n\n### Action Choice:\n- **Action 2 (LEFT)**: Move the avatar left to position it centrally for better coverage and to avoid being cornered.  \n- **Follow-up**: After moving, use `ACTION_USE` to fire missiles at the closest aliens (`@` at rows 3-5).  \n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Moving left will reposition the avatar to a safer and more strategic location, allowing better defense against incoming threats.  \n\n``` Action:2 ```  \nMoving left to centralize the avatar for better defense and missile targeting."
