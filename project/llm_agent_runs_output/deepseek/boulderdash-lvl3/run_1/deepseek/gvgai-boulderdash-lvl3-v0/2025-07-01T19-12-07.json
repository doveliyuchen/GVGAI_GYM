The immediate surroundings of the avatar include dirt ('.') and a boulder ('@') to the right (row=7, col=12). \n\n### Strategy Considerations:\n1. **Collect Diamonds**: The primary goal is to collect at least 10 diamonds to unlock the exit door. There are diamonds nearby at (row=7, col=23-24) and (row=6, col=23-24), but they are blocked by walls ('b'). Closer diamonds are at (row=3, col=5-7) and (row=4, col=1), but these require careful navigation due to boulders and enemies.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: The boulder at (row=7, col=12) is directly to the right of the avatar. Moving right could risk being crushed if the boulder falls. \n3. **Enemies**: There is a crab ('$') at (row=6, col=7) and a butterfly ('#') at (row=6, col=1). The butterfly could be lured into the crab to convert it into a diamond (+1 point), but this requires careful maneuvering.\n4. **Path to Exit**: The exit is above and to the left of the avatar, but it is currently blocked by dirt and boulders. Digging upward or leftward might be necessary to create a path.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe safest immediate action is to **dig left (ACTION_LEFT)** to clear a path toward the diamonds at (row=3, col=5-7) and avoid the boulder to the right. \n\n``` Action:2 ```  \n**Feedback**: Moving left to dig through dirt and create a safer path toward diamonds, avoiding the boulder to the right. If the avatar doesn't move, I'll press LEFT again to confirm movement after rotation."
