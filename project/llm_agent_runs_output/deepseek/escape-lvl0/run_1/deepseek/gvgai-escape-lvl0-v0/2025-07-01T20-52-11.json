These are dangerous and should be avoided.\n4. **Boxes**: There are multiple boxes (`@`) scattered around the map. Some are near walls or holes, which could be problematic if pushed incorrectly.\n5. **Walls**: The map is surrounded by walls (`%`), and there are internal walls blocking some paths.\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n- The exit is at the top-right (row=1, col=11), but the avatar is at the bottom-middle (row=6, col=5). The path to the exit is not straightforward due to boxes and holes.\n- There is a box (`@`) directly to the right of the avatar at (row=6, col=6). Pushing this box right could help clear a path, but we need to check what's beyond it.\n- To the left of the avatar is open floor (`.`) at (row=6, col=4), but moving left doesn't seem immediately helpful for reaching the exit.\n- Above the avatar (row=5, col=5) is a wall (`%`), so moving up is not possible.\n- Below the avatar (row=7, col=5) is open floor (`.`), but moving down doesn't seem to help progress toward the exit.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Clear Path to Exit**: The exit is at the top-right, so we need to move upward and rightward. However, the immediate upward path is blocked by a wall, so we need to find an alternative route.\n2. **Box Management**: The box at (row=6, col=6) is directly to the right of the avatar. Pushing it right could help, but we need to see what's beyond it:\n   - (row=6, col=7) is open floor (`.`), so pushing the box right is possible.\n   - This would move the box to (row=6, col=7) and the avatar to (row=6, col=6).\n3. **Avoid Holes**: The hole at (row=7, col=6) is below (row=6, col=6), so pushing the box right and then moving down could risk falling into the hole. We should avoid this.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Push the box at (row=6, col=6) to the right to (row=6, col=7). This clears space for the avatar to move right and potentially upward later.\n- After pushing the box, the avatar will be at (row=6, col=6), and the box will be at (row=6, col=7).\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:2 ```  \n(ACTION_RIGHT to push the box to the right.)  \n**Feedback**: Pushing the box right will clear space for the avatar to move toward the exit while avoiding immediate hazards.

To do this, the box at (row=1, col=10) must be moved out of the way.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move the Box**: The box at (row=1, col=10) is directly to the left of the avatar. To move it, the avatar must be positioned to push it upward (toward the exit) or to the side.\n   - Currently, the avatar is at (row=2, col=10), so pushing the box upward would require moving to (row=1, col=10) first, but that's not possible since the box is there.\n   - Instead, the avatar can move left to (row=2, col=9) and then push the box upward from there.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. Move left to (row=2, col=9) to position the avatar to push the box upward.\n2. Push the box upward from (row=1, col=10) to (row=1, col=11), which is the exit. This will clear the path.\n3. Move to the exit.\n\n### Action:\nFirst, move left to (row=2, col=9).\n\n``` Action:1 ```  \n(ACTION_LEFT to move from (row=2, col=10) to (row=2, col=9). Expectation: Avatar moves left to position itself to push the box upward next.  \n\n### Verification:\nAfter this action, the avatar should be at (row=2, col=9). If the position doesn't change, it might indicate a rotation is needed (as per the mechanics notice), and the same action should be repeated.  \n\nLet me know the next state to proceed with pushing the box upward!"

(empty floor)\n   - Up (1,9): '.' (empty floor)\n   - Down (3,9): '@' (box)\n\n3. **Exit Position**: The exit '#' is at (1,11), which is up and to the right from the avatar.\n\n4. **Obstacles**:\n   - There's a hole '$' at (2,4) and (4,1), but they're not immediately threatening.\n   - Multiple boxes ('@') around that could be used to block holes if needed.\n\n5. **Path to Exit**:\n   - The most straightforward path would be: \n     1. Move RIGHT to (2,10) (empty floor)\n     2. Then UP to (1,10) (box currently there - would need to be moved)\n   - However, the box at (1,10) is blocking direct access to the exit at (1,11).\n\n**Strategy**:\nFirst, I should move right to get into better position to potentially push the box at (1,10) out of the way. Since right is an empty space, this should work immediately.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nI expect to move right to (2,10), positioning myself to potentially push the box at (1,10) upwards or rightwards in future moves to clear the path to the exit."
