This aligns with the strategy of prioritizing diamond collection while maintaining safety.  \n\n**Feedback**: Expect to land on empty background ('.') and gain better access to diamonds or paths to other resources. If no movement occurs, the avatar may need to face downward first (repeat ACTION_DOWN)."
