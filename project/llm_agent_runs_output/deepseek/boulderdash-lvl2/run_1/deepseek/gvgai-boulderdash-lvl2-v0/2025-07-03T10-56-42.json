Move left to explore and approach the diamond at (row=2, col=11). Since the avatar is currently at (row=2, col=20), moving left (col=19) is safe (empty space '.').\n2. If the avatar doesn't move after the first left action, it might be rotating, so I'll try left again to ensure movement.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:2 ```  \nI expect the avatar to move left to (row=2, col=19), which is an empty space, allowing me to progress toward the diamond at (row=2, col=11).

Currently, it is to the right of the avatar.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- **Move Up (ACTION_UP)**: To avoid the boulder below and explore for diamonds.\n- **Use Sword (ACTION_USE)**: To dig dirt or interact with the environment to the right.\n- **Move Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: To move away from the boulder on the right, but there's another boulder to the left.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nGiven the boulder below the avatar, moving down is unsafe.

The safest immediate action is to move up to avoid the boulder and explore for diamonds.\n\n``` Action:5 ```  \n**Feedback**: Moving up to avoid the boulder below and explore the upper area for diamonds or safe paths.
