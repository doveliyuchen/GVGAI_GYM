If they collide, they can turn into a diamond.\n5. **Exit Door**: Located at (row=11, col=6), but it requires \u226510 diamonds to open.\n\n### Strategy Considerations:\n- **Priority**: Collect diamonds while avoiding boulders and enemies.\n- **Immediate Threat**: The boulder to the right (col=9) could fall if the dirt below is dug. The player should avoid standing under it.\n- **Safe Move**: Dig left (col=7) to create space and avoid the boulder. Alternatively, move left to explore other paths.\n- **Long-Term Goal**: Head toward the cluster of diamonds at the bottom-right (e.g., row=5-7, col=23-24), but this requires navigating carefully.\n\n### Action Choice:\nGiven the immediate threat of the boulder to the right, the safest move is to **dig left** (col=7) to create space and avoid being crushed. \n\n``` Action:1 ```  \n(ACTION_USE to dig the dirt to the left at col=7).  \n**Feedback**: This will clear the dirt to the left, allowing the player to move away from the boulder and explore safer paths.  \n\nIf the avatar doesn't move after ACTION_USE, the next step would be to move left (ACTION_2) to escape the boulder's danger zone.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust the strategy based on the result of this action!"
