However, the `movable` sprite is not present in the current state, so this is likely a deadlock.  \n\n### Action Decision:\nSince the key seems unreachable from the current position (due to walls blocking all paths), the only viable action is to **avoid enemies** and try to find an alternative path, though none seems available.

This is likely a mistake in the map description.\n- **Alternative**: If the key is truly unreachable, the player might need to defeat enemies first to open up paths or trigger other mechanics. However, the rules don't mention enemies affecting walls or keys.\n- **Re-evaluate Key Position**: The key at (3,10) is adjacent to a wall at (3,11), but the player might be able to reach it from below or above. From (3,6), the player can move down to (4,6), then right to (4,7), then up to (3,7), then right to (3,8) (wall), which doesn't help. This suggests the key might be unreachable, which is unlikely.

From (3,7), the player can move left to (3,6) or down to (4,7).

This path seems blocked, so an alternative is needed.\n  - Better path: From (3,7), move left to (3,6), down to (4,6), right to (4,7), up to (3,7) (back to start). This is a loop, so another approach is needed.\n  - Alternative: From (3,7), move down to (4,7), right to (4,8) (wall), so down is invalid. Left to (4,6), then down to (5,6), right to (5,7), up to (4,7) (loop again).

Since the player can shoot swords (`stype=sword`), it might be necessary to eliminate the enemy to clear the path.\n\n### Action:\nGiven the current position (3,7), the enemy at (2,8) is to the top-right. The player can shoot a sword to eliminate it. \n\n``` Action:1 ```  \n(ACTION_USE to shoot a sword upwards or towards the enemy, depending on the avatar's current orientation. Since the enemy is at (2,8) and the player is at (3,7), the player should face upwards (ACTION_UP) first, then shoot.)\n\nHowever, since the rules state that directional actions may require rotation first, the sequence should be:\n1. Rotate to face the enemy (ACTION_UP to face upwards).\n2. Then shoot (ACTION_USE).\n\nAssuming the avatar is not already facing upwards, the first action should be to rotate:\n\n``` Action:5 ```  \n(ACTION_UP to rotate upwards, preparing to shoot the enemy at (2,8). Expectation: The avatar will now face upwards, and the next action can be ACTION_USE to shoot the enemy.)\n\nFeedback: Rotating upwards to face the enemy at (2,8), preparing to shoot it in the next move to clear the path towards the key.

This means the player does not currently have the key.\n2. **Key Position**: The key (`#`) is at (3,10).\n3. **Enemies**: There are several enemies (`$` or `monsterNormal`) at positions (1,6), (3,9), and (6,9).\n4. **Goal**: The goal (`@`) is at (5,10).\n5. **Walls**: Walls (`w`) surround the map and are scattered inside, blocking paths.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Priority 1**: Collect the key (`#`) at (3,10) to transform into `withkey`.\n- **Priority 2**: Avoid or defeat enemies (losing points is bad, but killing enemies grants +2 points).\n- **Priority 3**: Reach the goal (`@`) after getting the key.\n\n### Path to Key:\nFrom (2,7), the key is at (3,10). Possible path:\n1. Move right to (2,8) (open space).\n2. Move down to (3,8) (blocked by wall at (3,8)).\n   - Alternative: Move down to (3,7) first, then right to (3,8) (but (3,8) is a wall).\n   - Better: Move right to (2,8), then down to (3,8) (wall), so this path is blocked.\n3. Alternative path:\n   - Move down to (3,7), then right to (3,8) (wall), blocked.\n   - Move left to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), (3,8) (wall), etc.\n\nThis seems tricky due to walls. Let's try:\n- Move down to (3,7) (open), then right to (3,8) (wall). Not helpful.\n- Move left to (2,6) (open), then down to (3,6) (open), then right to (3,7), (3,8) (wall). Still stuck.\n- Move right to (2,8) (open), then down to (3,8) (wall). No progress.\n\nWait, the key is at (3,10), and the wall at (3,11) blocks further right. The only way is to go around the wall at (3,8):\n1. From (2,7), move left to (2,6).\n2. Move down to (3,6).\n3. Move right to (3,7).\n4. Move down to (4,7) (open), then left to (4,6), etc. This seems too long.\n\nAlternative: Maybe the avatar can shoot swords to kill enemies blocking the path. But the priority is the key, not combat yet.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nFrom (2,7), the only open directions are left (to (2,6)) or right (to (2,8)). Moving right seems closer to the key's column (col=10). \n\n``` Action:3 ```  \n(ACTION_RIGHT to (2,8)). Expectation: Move right to (2,8), which is open and closer to the key's path. If position doesn't change, it means rotation occurred, and I'll need to repeat the action.  \n\nFeedback: Moving right to (2,8) should bring me closer to the key's location, though walls may require further adjustments. If I don't move, I'll repeat the action to confirm movement."

These enemies move at normal speed and can be dangerous if they touch the player.\n3. **Obstacles**: \n   - Walls (`w`) surround the map. The key is behind a wall at (3, 10), but there is a path to reach it via (3, 9) -> (3, 10).\n   - The goal (`@`) is at (5, 10), but the player must first collect the key to open it.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\n- **Priority**: Collect the key first (`#` at (3, 10)) to transform into `withkey` and unlock the goal.\n- **Path to Key**: \n  - From (2, 8), move left to (2, 7), then down to (3, 7), then right to (3, 9), and finally right to (3, 10) to collect the key.\n  - Avoid or kill the `monsterNormal` at (3, 9) if necessary (use sword if it blocks the path).\n- **Avoid Enemies**: If possible, avoid engaging enemies until the key is collected to conserve sword uses.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n- From (2, 8), the shortest path to the key is left to (2, 7). The enemy at (1, 6) is not an immediate threat, so moving left is safe.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:2 ```  \nMove LEFT to (2, 7) to start the path toward the key.
