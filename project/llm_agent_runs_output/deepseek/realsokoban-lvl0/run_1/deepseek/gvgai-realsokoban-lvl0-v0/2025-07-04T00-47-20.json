The game is won when no regular boxes remain.\n\n### Observations:\n- The avatar is currently adjacent to a hole at (2,5) (right of the avatar).\n- There is a box at (1,6) that could potentially be pushed down into the hole at (2,5).\n- The box at (3,2) could be pushed right, but there's no hole nearby yet.\n- The box at (5,4) is near holes at (4,3) and (4,5), but the avatar needs to navigate there first.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe most straightforward move is to push the box at (1,6) down into the hole at (2,5).

So, the avatar cannot move to (2,5). \n\nAlternative path:\n- Move up to (1,3), then right to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nBut (1,3) is '.' (ground), so this is possible.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. Move up to (1,3): `ACTION_UP`\n2. Move right to (1,6): `ACTION_RIGHT` (three times, but need to confirm if the avatar can move multiple steps in one action; likely not, so one step at a time).\n3. Once at (1,6), push the box down to (2,6), which is '.'

Prioritize pushing the box at (row=5, col=1) upwards towards the hole at (row=4, col=3).\n2. Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they can't be moved again.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move the avatar down to (row=4, col=3) to position itself to push the box at (row=5, col=1) upwards.\n2. Then push the box upwards into the hole at (row=4, col=3).\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n1. First, move the avatar down to (row=4, col=3). However, (row=4, col=3) is a hole, so we need to approach from the side.\n   - Move left to (row=3, col=2), then down to (row=4, col=2), then right to (row=4, col=3) (but this is a hole, so we can't stand there).\n   - Alternatively, move right to (row=3, col=4), then down to (row=4, col=4), then left to (row=4, col=3) (but again, this is a hole).\n   - It seems the hole at (row=4, col=3) is not directly accessible for pushing the box at (row=5, col=1). Maybe we need to approach from the left.\n\n2. Let's try moving left to (row=3, col=2), then down to (row=4, col=2), then left to (row=4, col=1), then up to (row=3, col=1) (but this is a wall).\n   - This path seems blocked.\n\n3. Alternative approach: Move right to (row=3, col=4), then down to (row=4, col=4), then right to (row=4, col=5) (hole), then down to (row=5, col=5) (box).\n   - This seems convoluted.\n\n4. Maybe start by pushing the box at (row=5, col=1) upwards:\n   - Move left to (row=3, col=2), then down to (row=4, col=2), then left to (row=4, col=1), then down to (row=5, col=1) (box).\n   - Now, push the box up to (row=4, col=1). But (row=4, col=1) is ground, not a hole, so this doesn't help.\n\nThis seems stuck. Maybe a better approach is to push the box at (row=1, col=6) leftwards:\n- Move up to (row=2, col=3) (hole), then right to (row=2, col=4), then up to (row=1, col=4), then right to (row=1, col=5), then up to (row=1, col=6) (box).\n- Now, push the box left to (row=1, col=5). But (row=1, col=5) is ground, not a hole.\n\nThis also doesn't help. \n\n### Re-evaluating:\nPerhaps the first move should be to move right to (row=3, col=4), then up to (row=2, col=4), then left to (row=2, col=3) (hole), then down to (row=3, col=3) (avatar's original position). This doesn't achieve anything.\n\n### Final Decision:\nGiven the complexity, let's start by moving the avatar right to (row=3, col=4) to get closer to the box at (row=5, col=5).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMove right to position the avatar closer to the box at (row=5, col=5), aiming to eventually push it towards a hole.

Here's a grid representation (rows 0-6, columns 0-7):\n\n```\nRow 0: $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\nRow 1: $ $ . . . . @ $\nRow 2: $ $ . # . a . $\nRow 3: $ $ . . . . . $\nRow 4: $ . . # . # . $\nRow 5: $ @ . . . @ @ $\nRow 6: $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Avatar Position**: At (row=2, col=5), represented by 'a'.\n2. **Boxes ('@')**: \n   - (1,6), (5,1), (5,5), (5,6)\n3. **Holes ('#')**: \n   - (2,3), (4,3), (4,5)\n4. **Walls ('$')**: Surrounding the map and some internal walls.\n5. **Ground ('.')**: Walkable spaces.\n\n### Goal:\nPush all boxes ('@') into holes ('#') to convert them into 'boxin' (scored blocks). The game is won when no regular boxes remain.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Deadlocks**: Don't push boxes into corners or against walls where they can't be moved again.\n2. **Prioritize Holes Near Walls**: Fill holes close to walls first to avoid trapping the avatar.\n3. **Current Focus**: The hole at (2,3) is near the avatar and a wall. Let's try to push the box at (1,6) into this hole.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move the avatar to (1,6) to push the box left into the hole at (2,3).\n   - From (2,5), move UP to (1,5).\n   - Then move RIGHT to (1,6).\n   - Push the box LEFT to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then left to (2,4), and finally into the hole at (2,3).\n\n### Step-by-Step Actions:\n1. **First Action**: Move UP from (2,5) to (1,5).\n   - Action: 4 (UP)\n   - Expected: Avatar moves to (1,5).\n\n``` Action:4 ```  \nMove UP to position (1,5) to approach the box at (1,6).\n\n2. **Next State**: After moving UP, the avatar should be at (1,5). Now, move RIGHT to (1,6).\n   - Action: 2 (RIGHT)\n   - Expected: Avatar moves to (1,6).\n\n``` Action:2 ```  \nMove RIGHT to position (1,6) to prepare pushing the box left.\n\n3. **Next State**: Avatar at (1,6). Now, push the box LEFT to (1,5).\n   - Action: 1 (LEFT)\n   - Expected: Box moves to (1,5), avatar stays at (1,6) (since pushing requires the avatar to be behind the box).\n\nWait, this seems incorrect. The box is at (1,6), and the avatar is at (1,6). To push the box left, the avatar must be to the right of the box. Currently, the avatar is at the same position as the box, which is not possible. This suggests a flaw in the plan.\n\n### Revised Plan:\nThe box at (1,6) cannot be pushed left because the avatar cannot be to its right (it's against the wall at (1,7)). Thus, this box is stuck and cannot be moved. This is a deadlock, meaning the initial plan is invalid.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nLook for another box to push. The box at (5,1) is near the hole at (4,3). Let's try to push this box up into the hole.\n\n1. Move the avatar to (5,1):\n   - From (2,5), move DOWN to (3,5), then (4,5), then (5,5).\n   - Then move LEFT to (5,1).\n\n2. Push the box at (5,1) UP to (4,1), then RIGHT to (4,2), then UP to (3,2), then RIGHT to (3,3), but (3,3) is ground, not a hole. The hole is at (4,3), so this path doesn't work.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the box at (5,5) can be pushed left into the hole at (4,5).\n\n1. Move avatar to (5,5):\n   - From (2,5), move DOWN to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5).\n2. Push the box at (5,5) LEFT to (5,4), then UP to (4,4), then LEFT to (4,3) (hole).\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n1. Move DOWN from (2,5) to (3,5):\n   - Action: 3 (DOWN)\n   - Expected: Avatar moves to (3,5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove DOWN to (3,5) to start approaching the box at (5,5).\n\n2. Next, move DOWN to (4,5):\n   - Action: 3 (DOWN)\n   - Expected: Avatar moves to (4,5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove DOWN to (4,5), closer to the box at (5,5).\n\n3. Next, move DOWN to (5,5):\n   - Action: 3 (DOWN)\n   - Expected: Avatar moves to (5,5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove DOWN to (5,5) to prepare pushing the box left.\n\n4. Push the box at (5,5) LEFT to (5,4):\n   - Action: 1 (LEFT)\n   - Expected: Box moves to (5,4), avatar stays at (5,5).\n\nWait, again the avatar is at the same position as the box (5,5), so pushing left would require the avatar to be to the right of the box, which it is not. This is another deadlock.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe current state seems to have boxes in positions where they cannot be pushed into holes without causing deadlocks. This suggests the level may be unsolvable from this state, or additional strategies (like using the 'bbox' bounce) are needed, but no 'bbox' is present in the current map.\n\n### Final Attempt:\nTry pushing the box at (5,6) left:\n1. Move to (5,6):\n   - From (2,5), move DOWN to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then RIGHT to (5,6).\n2. Push the box at (5,6) LEFT to (5,5), then UP to (4,5), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (3,4), but no hole there.\n\nThis also seems stuck.\n\n### Final Action:\nGiven the apparent deadlock, the best action is to move towards another box to explore possibilities, but it seems challenging. Let's try moving towards the box at (5,1):\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove DOWN to (3,5) to start approaching the box at (5,1). This is a preliminary step to explore alternative paths."

The game is won when no regular boxes remain.\n\n### Observations:\n- The avatar is near a box at (row=1, col=6), which is directly above it at (row=2, col=6). \n- The box at (row=1, col=6) can be pushed upward into the hole at (row=2, col=5) or leftward into the hole at (row=2, col=3).\n- The box at (row=5, col=1) is isolated and may require moving other boxes first.\n- The boxes at (row=5, col=5) and (row=5, col=6) are near holes at (row=4, col=5) and (row=4, col=3).\n\n### Strategy:\n1.

This would convert the box to a \"boxin\" (scoring +1).\n  - Right: Blocked by a wall at (1,7).\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- **Priority**: Convert boxes to \"boxin\" by pushing them into holes, starting with the most constrained boxes (e.g., the one at (1,6)).\n- **Avoid Deadlocks**: Pushing the box at (1,6) left into the hole at (1,5) is safe and irreversible (since \"boxin\" cannot be pushed back).\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move the avatar to (1,6) to position itself to push the box left. Currently, the avatar is at (2,6), so it needs to move **UP** (ACTION_UP) to (1,6).\n   - However, (1,6) is occupied by a box, so the avatar cannot move there directly. Instead, we must first push the box left.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n- The avatar is already facing the box at (1,6) (assuming default orientation). Pushing the box left requires:\n  1. **ACTION_LEFT**: Rotate the avatar to face left (if not already facing left).\n  2. **ACTION_LEFT again**: Push the box left into the hole at (1,5).\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:1 ``` \n(First ACTION_LEFT to ensure the avatar is facing left, then another ACTION_LEFT to push the box into the hole). \n\n**Feedback**: Expect the box at (1,6) to be pushed left into the hole at (1,5), converting it to a \"boxin\" and scoring +1. This aligns with the strategy of prioritizing constrained boxes first. \n\n---\nNote: If the avatar's position does not change after the first ACTION_LEFT, it means it was already facing left, and the second ACTION_LEFT will push the box. If the avatar moves left instead (unlikely due to the wall at (2,5)), adjust with ACTION_RIGHT to reposition. \n\n---\nAfter this action, the next step would be to address the boxes at (5,1), (5,5), and (5,6), likely by moving downward."

This would not help the objective.\n- The box at (5,1) is near the left wall. Pushing it right could be useful if there's a hole nearby, but the nearest hole is at (2,3) or (4,3), which is far.\n- The boxes at (5,5) and (5,6) are near holes at (4,5) and (4,3). These seem like good candidates to push.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Focus on pushing the box at (5,6) upward to fill the hole at (4,5). This seems achievable:\n   - Move the avatar to (5,6) by going down twice (from (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6)).\n   - Then push the box upward to (4,6), but (4,6) is ground, not a hole. The hole is at (4,5), so we need to approach from the right.\n   - Alternatively, push the box at (5,5) left to (5,4), then up to (4,4), but (4,4) is ground, not a hole.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n### Better Approach:\n- The box at (5,5) is adjacent to the hole at (4,5). If the avatar moves to (5,5) from the left (i.e., from (5,4)), it can push the box upward into the hole at (4,5).\n- To get to (5,4), the avatar needs to move:\n   - From (3,6): down to (4,6), down to (5,6), left to (5,5), left to (5,4).\n   - Then, from (5,4), push right to (5,5), then up to (4,5) (filling the hole).\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. Move down to (4,6).\n2. Move down to (5,6).\n3. Move left to (5,5).\n4. Move left to (5,4).\n5. Move right to (5,5) (pushing the box at (5,5) to (5,6)).\n   - Wait, this would push the box right, not up. Not what we want.\n   - Instead, from (5,4), push right to (5,5), then up to (4,5).\n\nWait, no: pushing from (5,4) to (5,5) would push the box to (5,6), not up. \n\n### Correct Plan:\nTo push the box at (5,5) up, the avatar must be below it (i.e., at (6,5)), but (6,5) is a wall. So this box cannot be pushed up directly.\n\nAlternative: Push the box at (5,1) right to (5,2), then up to (4,2), but the nearest hole is at (4,3). This seems too far.\n\n### Re-evaluate:\nPerhaps the box at (1,6) is the best candidate. Push it left to (1,5), then down to (2,5), which is a hole. This would convert it to a \"boxin\".\n\n### Final Plan:\n1. Move up to (2,6).\n2. Move left to (2,5) (but this is a hole, so not possible).\nWait, no: the avatar is at (3,6). To push the box at (1,6) left:\n- Move up to (2,6).\n- Move up to (1,6) (but this is the box; you can't stand on it).\n- Instead, from (3,6), move up to (2,6), then left to (2,5) (hole), then up to (1,5) (but (1,5) is ground, and (1,6) is the box).\n\nThis seems messy. Let's try:\n\n### Action:\nFrom (3,6), move up to (2,6). Then push the box at (1,6) left to (1,5).\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n(Up to (2,6)).

Pushing it left would move it to (1,5), but (1,5) is ground ('.'), which is safe.\n- The box at (5,1) is near the wall at (5,0).

So we need to push UP.\n\nHowever, looking at the map, there's a wall at (1,7) to the right of the box, so pushing up would be safe as it would go into open space.\n\nAction: 4 (UP)\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nI expect the avatar to push the box at (1,6) upwards, but since there's a wall at (0,6) above it, the box can't move up. Instead, the avatar will likely move up to (1,6) and the box will stay in place (since it can't move further up). This will position us to then push the box left or right in subsequent moves.\n\nAlternative better action might be to push LEFT first to move the box at (1,6) left to (1,5), but that's ground so it would just move the box without scoring. Maybe better to leave that box for now and go for another box.\n\nLet me reconsider - perhaps targeting the box at (5,1) would be better, moving it right towards the hole at (4,3). But that's far from current position.\n\nGiven the immediate options, pushing the nearby box at (1,6) seems most practical, even if not directly into a hole yet. We can reposition it first.\n\nUpdated Action: 4 (UP)\n``` Action:4 ```\nExpectation: Avatar moves up to (1,6), preparing to push the box left or right in next moves. This positions us to eventually push this box down into the hole at (2,5)."

This is the closest box-hole pair.\n- To do this, the avatar must be to the **left** of the box (i.e., face right and push the box rightward into the hole).\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Move Left** to position the avatar at (1,4) to face the box at (1,6).\n2. Then, **move Right** to push the box into the hole at (2,5).\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n1. First, move left to (1,4):\n   - Current position: (1,5). Left is (1,4), which is ground ('.'). This is safe.\n   - Action: `ACTION_LEFT` (1).\n   - Expected: Avatar moves to (1,4).\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n**Feedback**: Moving left to (1,4) to position myself for pushing the box at (1,6) rightward into the hole at (2,5). \n\n### Next Steps (After Confirming Movement):\nOnce the avatar is at (1,4), the next action would be `ACTION_RIGHT` (2) to push the box. However, since we can only submit one action at a time, we'll proceed after verifying the new state. \n\n(Note: If the avatar doesn't move after `ACTION_LEFT`, it might need to face left first, then move left again. But based on the rules, directional actions should move the avatar if the path is clear.)"

Even though it can't be pushed further up (wall above), this will help assess if the box can be moved left or right from its current position in subsequent moves. \n\nExpectation: The avatar will move up to (1,6), pushing the box to (0,6) if possible (but it will hit the wall, so position may not change - then I can try moving the box left or right in next moves)."
