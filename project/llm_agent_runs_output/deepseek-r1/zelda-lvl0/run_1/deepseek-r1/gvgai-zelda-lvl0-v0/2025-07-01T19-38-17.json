These move every 4 ticks and pose a threat if they close in.\n- **Path to Goal**: \n  - Direct right from (5,7) is blocked by a wall at (5,8). \n  - The safe path is: **down to (6,7) \u2192 right to (6,10) \u2192 up to (5,10)** (goal). \n  - (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), and (6,10) are all empty floor tiles (`.`), and no enemies are immediately adjacent to this path.\n\n### Strategy Execution\n- **Priority**: Reach the goal (5,10) without delay. With the key already collected, movement is the only requirement. \n- **Risk Assessment**: \n  - Enemies are at (6,2) and (7,4), both 3+ tiles away from the planned path. \n  - `monsterNormal` moves slowly (cooldown=4), so they are unlikely to intercept within the next 2-3 steps.\n- **Action Choice**: Move **DOWN** to (6,7). This positions the avatar to then move right toward the goal. If the avatar doesn\u2019t move (due to rotation mechanics), the next action must be **DOWN** again.\n\n``` Action:4 ```  \n*Moving down to (6,7) to start the safe path toward the goal at (5,10).
