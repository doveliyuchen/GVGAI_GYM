No visible bombs (`&`) yet.  \n- **Bases**: Intact bases (`#`) form protective clusters at row 7-9 (columns 4-6, 12-18, 23-27).  \n- **Active Missile**: A player missile (`%`) is already in flight at (9, 9), moving upward.  \n- **Strategic Context**:  \n  - The alien directly above the avatar at (0, 8) poses a high risk of dropping bombs.  \n  - Bases at row 9 (columns 7, 12-13, 18-19, 23-27) offer immediate overhead protection if the avatar moves under them.  \n  - Existing missile at (9, 9) means **shooting is disabled** until it resolves (hits an alien/base or exits).  \n\n### Decision Rationale\n- **Priority**: Avoid being under uncovered columns (e.g., column 8) to mitigate bomb risk. Move to column 7 where a base (`#` at row 9, col 7) provides overhead protection.  \n- **Action Choice**: `ACTION_LEFT` (2) to shift the avatar left to (10, 7).  \n- **Expected Outcome**:  \n  - Position under base at (9, 7) to block potential bombs from alien (0, 8).  \n  - Preserve bases for late-game defense while waiting to shoot again.  \n\n``` Action:2 ```  \nMove left to column 7 for base cover against bomb threats from the alien above column 8."

Shooting now would destroy our own base (+1 point but weakens defenses).\n\n2. **Threat Assessment**: \n   - No immediate bombs ('&') near avatar\n   - Alien clusters at top (row0) and mid-screen (row1-2)\n   - Existing player missile ('%') at (8,9) already in flight\n\n3. **Strategic Priority**: \n   - Reposition to avoid base-friendly-fire while maintaining defensive coverage\n   - Clear shooting lane needed for alien elimination (avoid columns with base structures above)\n\n4. **Optimal Movement**: \n   - Move RIGHT to column 8 where:\n     - No base above (row9,col8 = '.' and row8,col8 = '.')\n     - Central position maintains coverage of alien clusters\n     - Avoids screen edge (col29 is far)\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMoving right to column 8 for clear shooting lane; expect to fire at aliens next turn without damaging bases."

Column 8 (avatar's column) has a clear vertical path to aliens (no bases blocking).  \n- **Active Missile**: One `sam` missile (`%`) at (7, 9) \u2013 already targeting the right side.  \n\n### Strategy Alignment  \n1. **Prioritize Fast Elimination**: `alienGreen` groups exist but aren't directly threatened. Moving right positions the avatar under dense alien clusters (e.g., col 9-10, 18-19) for efficient targeting.  \n2. **Base Protection**: Current path in column 8 is clear \u2013 moving right avoids risking base collisions when shooting later.  \n3. **Dodge Preparation**: No immediate threats, but centralizing the avatar (col 9-10) maximizes dodging space for future bombs.  \n\n### Action Choice  \n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove right to column 9, aligning under an alien cluster for a clear shot next turn while avoiding base interference.
