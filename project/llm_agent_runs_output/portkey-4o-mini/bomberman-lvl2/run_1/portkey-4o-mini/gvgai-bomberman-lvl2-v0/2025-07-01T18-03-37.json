Since there are walls nearby, I will need to explore routes that allow me to reach the door safely.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Moving Left (4, 8)**: This does not seem to lead closer to the goal.\n2. **Moving Right (4, 10)**: This leads further along row 4 but remains a distance from the goal.\n3. **Moving Up (3, 9)**: This is an unutilized space in a straight route to the goal.\n4. **Moving Down (5, 9)**: This also leads to an unutilized space, but it keeps the bomberman near the row of the goal.\n\nAfter weighing out the actions and utility of the spaces, I will move up towards (3, 9) as it aligns me to make subsequent moves without immediate threat from adjacent enemies and positions me generally on the vertical pathway to the goal door.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to bring me closer to the upper rows where the goal is while maintaining safety from immediate enemy threats."
