There are also various obstacles such as walls (`*`), and a few enemies represented by `@`, `%`, and `&`.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- I need to navigate from my current position (7, 11) to the goal at (1, 11).\n- The path directly upwards is blocked by walls in row 0 (multiple `*`), so I need to consider how to move around them.\n- Enemies are present, and I have to avoid them while trying to reach the goal.\n- I currently have a bomb (`d`) in my possession located at (7, 12), which I may use strategically to clear walls or deal with enemies later.\n\n### Moving Strategy:\n1. My immediate goal is to find a way to either create a path upward towards the goal or maneuver around the walls.\n2. The first action could be to move down (to row 8, 11) to evaluate if there are any more useful actions available (like placing bombs from the lower row).\n\n### Decision:\nBased on long-term plans and current layout, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move my avatar down one step to (8, 11), allowing me to explore further and plan subsequent moves towards the goal."

However, I need to be cautious of spider positions at (7, 8) and (7, 18).\n\nSince the bomberman is currently on the goal path, I will attempt to go left towards (7, 10) first, as this could allow me to observe the surrounding threats more effectively.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will help reposition towards the threats and observe more possibilities for the next round without committing to an unsafe area. I expect it to align with my strategy of carefully assessing the position before making a direct move towards the goal."

    "content": "To determine the best action to take in this scenario, let's analyze the current state based on the provided map and game rules.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n- **Avatar Position**: Your bomberman avatar is positioned at row 7, column 11 (`#`).\n- **Nearby Elements**:\n  - Directly adjacent to the bomberman is the goal wall-break (`$`) at (row 1, col 11) which is quite a distance from the avatar.\n  - There are two enemy sprites: the bat (`@`) at (1, 2) and two spiders (`&`) at positions (7, 8) and (7, 18). \n  - Walls (`*`) are blocking various paths, but there are some destructible walls (`b`) nearby that can potentially create new paths.\n\n### Strategies to Apply\n1. **Bomb Placement**: Given the enemies nearby and the mapping of the surroundings, the bomberman can utilize bombs to break destructible walls to navigate risks with enemies while still aiming for the goal.\n2. **Movement Considerations**: Since `@` are relatively far and there are paths that can be broken open, the immediate action should consider placing a bomb to break through walls while considering enemy movement patterns.\n\n### Current Position Movement\nHowever, the current row for the bomberman does not change because the last action has not been provided. Therefore, applying a directional action to move away from the current position is necessary instead of standing still. \n\n### Suggested Action\nSince the bomberman is currently on (7, 11), a logical outcome would be to plan an escape route or to break through the destructible paths nearby. Given the state does not change, movement is necessary.\n\nImplement the action to move down to `ACTION_DOWN` (to row 8, 11):\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will allow the bomberman to move down and explore further, aiming towards potential paths or enemies while ensuring a better position for future bomb placements. My expectation is that moving downwards will allow for future interactions with destructible walls or enemies that can be tactically dealt with."

We need to navigate our way through the level, avoiding enemies and using bombs strategically to reach the goal.\n\n### Analyzing the Immediate Surroundings:\n- **Avatar Position**: (7, 11)\n- **Goal Position**: (1, 11)\n- **Enemies**: There is a spider (`&`) at (7, 8) and (7, 18), and there's a scorpion (`%`) at (1, 10) which may pose a danger.\n- **Walls**: Numerous walls (`*`) block direct movement, and there are wall breaks (`b`) available for bomb placement.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position remains constant, the best course of action is to attempt movement towards the goal while considering both enemy positions. \n\n### Next Steps:\nMoving **up** to (6, 11) appears to be a safe option since this location does not place the bomberman in immediate danger of enemy sprites. This also brings the bomberman closer to the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up to (6, 11) is a logical step towards the goal considering the player must navigate around opposing forces while avoiding confrontation.

A bomb ('i') is also found directly to the right at (7, 12).\n\nTo win, your goal is to break through the goal wall and reach it while managing the threats from the enemies.\n\n**Analysis**: \n1. You are already in the right position to reach the goal.\n2. There is a bomb right next to you, indicating potential resources or threats nearby.\n3. No immediate threats are present since you are not surrounded by enemies.\n\n**Action**: \nSince your goal is directly adjacent, the most efficient action would be to move towards the goal.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving right towards the goal wall break aligns with the strategy to reach the objective directly while avoiding unnecessary confrontations or obstacles."
