    "content": "To proceed in this game based on the provided map and your avatar's current position (row 2, col 4), let\u2019s assess the environment and potential actions.\n\n### Current State Overview:\n- Your avatar (`a`) is currently at position (2, 4).\n- Surrounding sprites:\n  - To the left (2, 3): an empty space (`.`)\n  - To the right (2, 5): an empty space (`.`)\n  - Above (1, 4): an empty space (`.`)\n  - Below (3, 4): a normal boulder (`%`)\n\n### Objectives and Considerations:\n1. **Goal Awareness**: The goal is located at two spots (positions (2, 11) and (6, 14)). Reaching either should be a priority.\n2. **Avoiding Holes**: Be cautious, as the holes (denoted by `#`) are located downwards (4, 5 through 4, 8).\n3. **Boulders and Blocks**: There is a boulder below at (3, 4) that can potentially be pushed or moved.\n\n### Initial Action Decision:\nGiven that moving down would allow interaction with the boulder, it seems the most strategic to push it. However, the move doesn't directly obstruct reaching the goal, so the immediate best action will rely on safely pushing the boulder without putting the avatar in a position to expose it to holes.\n\n#### Planned Move:\n- Action: **Down** to (3, 4) to interact with the normal boulder (`%`).\n\n### Action Selection:\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis downwards action allows interaction with the boulder, and from there, I can strategize further movements toward the goals while avoiding the penalties from holes. I expect this brings me closer to manipulating objects effectively on the map towards achieving the game\u2019s objectives."
