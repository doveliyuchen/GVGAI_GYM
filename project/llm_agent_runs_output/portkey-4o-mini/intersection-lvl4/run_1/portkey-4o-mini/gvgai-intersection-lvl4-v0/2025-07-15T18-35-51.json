To do that, we should immediately evaluate the best direction to move considering your options while also ensuring you do not remain in a stationary position.\n\nHowever, since the immediate left and down are not viable options (due to walls and trees), the only feasible movement right is our next logical step towards reaching the ultimate goal.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right aligns with the strategy of making progress toward the goal, expecting to advance further along the path while observing the inefficiencies of the obstacles surrounding my immediate vicinity."
