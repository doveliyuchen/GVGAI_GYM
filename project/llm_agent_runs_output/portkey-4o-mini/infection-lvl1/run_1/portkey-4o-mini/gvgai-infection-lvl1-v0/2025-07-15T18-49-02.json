As per the strategy, my actions should prioritize eliminating viruses and infected entities and ensuring hosts remain safe.\n\nCurrently, my goal is to engage the nearest infected sprites while avoiding letting any host interact with an infected sprite. From the current state, the closest infected sprites to act upon are located near the lower sections of the map.\n\nSince I have multiple '@' avatars and they have not moved, I'll decide to take an action:\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of my strategies, I\u2019ll begin my movement to position a doctor closer to eliminate immediate threats while engaging the mechanics of containment and transformation effectively.\n\nI will move **UP** (Action 5) from Row 7, Column 16 (which is one of the nearest positions to hosts and infected):\n\n``` Action:5 ```\n\nThis action is intended to reposition in a way that allows better access to both eliminating infected entities and protecting the hosts. I expect to see if this action aligns with my need to manage the infected challenge effectively."
