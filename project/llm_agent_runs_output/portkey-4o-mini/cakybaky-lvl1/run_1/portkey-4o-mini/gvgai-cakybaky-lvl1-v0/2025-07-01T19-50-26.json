I'll aim for inc3 as it's relatively nearby.\n2. **Avoid Chaser**: It's essential to remain cautious of the chaser while navigating. \n\n#### Current State Review\nGiven that the avatar needs to collect inc3 at (1, 4):\n- The nearest '@' is at (2, 10). \n\nThus, I will take the following series of logical steps:\nSince there's a table (i) at (2, 2) restricting leftward movement and subsequent paths: moving left to (1, 9) isn't possible. Instead, I will need to analyze further towards moving down to explore other collecting areas.\n\n### Action Decision\nConsidering all this, I'm going to take the action of moving **UP** from one of the position where '@' exists at row 2, col 10 (which means moving left from row 2,. This will be a progressive step towards getting to ingredient at (1,4):\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is consistent with optimal movement strategies as it involves navigating through open paths effectively while heading toward the ingredients without colliding with walls or chasers. Let's see if this aligns with the objective of collecting required resources efficiently."
