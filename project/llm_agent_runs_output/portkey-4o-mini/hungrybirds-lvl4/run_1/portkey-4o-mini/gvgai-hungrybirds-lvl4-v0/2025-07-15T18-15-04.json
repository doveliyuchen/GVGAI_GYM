From (11, 7), the following Down move will take the avatar to (12, 7), progressing closer to the goal.\n\nIt's crucial to make a move that doesn't keep the avatar idle too long since health points deplete when idle. \n\n### Decision:\nI'll choose to move down since it allows immediate progression and keeps options open for further moves toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should bring the avatar closer to the goal while managing the health situation effectively."
