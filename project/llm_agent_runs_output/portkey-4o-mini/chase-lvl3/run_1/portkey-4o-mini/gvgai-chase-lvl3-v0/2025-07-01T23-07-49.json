Moving **right** leads to another free space but doesn't provide a direct benefit to sprite interactions.\n\n### Goal \nGiven that my avatar needs to retain its identity and not transform into a carcass, the safest moves would be to head towards empty spaces without opening up to potential encounters with angry sprites. To minimize risks and keep options open for next turns, moving **up** could help scout the area above me.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the action to move **up**. \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \nThis action keeps me in a safe area while allowing for future sprite interaction opportunities."

However, the avatar's current position gives limited direction with walls as barriers.\n   \n### Decision\nSince there are no direct paths available to interacting with any scared sprites and the avatar is confined by walls, it should first move to check surroundings. The only viable initial movement is down (from (8, 5) to (9, 5)), as this keeps the avatar safe from immovable walls and may open other actions in subsequent turns.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is:\n```Action:3```\nThis expected action allows for better positioning on the map for future turns while ensuring the avatar remains secure from transformation."

I want to eliminate all scared sprites while avoiding losing my avatar state to a carcass.\n2. Movement should be calculated to engage the scared sprites without backtracking or encountering walls unnecessarily.\n\n### Current Assessment:\nCurrently, I have the option to move in the following directions:\n- Move Up (8, 8) -> (7, 8)\n- Move Down (8, 8) -> (9, 8)\n- Move Left (8, 8) -> (8, 7)\n- Move Right (8, 8) -> (8, 9)\n\nThe only clear movement option without hitting a wall while potentially moving towards the scared sprites is to move up.\n\n### Choosing the Action:\nI will take the action to move **Up** (to 7, 8).\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to reposition towards the upper levels of the map where the scared sprites are located. I expect it aligns well with the strategy by keeping momentum towards engaging with the scared sprites while avoiding danger."
