Thus, you should continue moving downward to line yourself up better horizontally with the goal.\n2. **Collect Treasures**: There are plenty of landSand treasures nearby, which should be collected if they can be accessed without unnecessary risk.\n\n### Next Action:\nTo move closer to the goal, I will take the action to move **down** one row.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will help position the avatar closer to the goal while remaining on safe land.
