However, there are some aliens located at row 2 and row 3 directly above the avatar's row.\n\n### Available Resources\n- The game requires careful ammo management.

However, it would be risky to approach these without confirming safety from enemy attacks.\n\n### Strategic Move\nTo stay agile and prepare for any potential alien threats that may drop bombs on the city below, I will apply a downward move to refresh to a more balanced and central position.

I need to prioritize dealing with the aliens to prevent them from dropping bombs on the city.\n2. My current ammunition isn't specified, but resources appear to be tight, so I must be cautious about my movement and attacks.\n3. The nearest aliens to my position are at (4, 3) and (4, 20). Both are reachable through movement.\n4. Bombs in my vicinity could cause damage to my avatar if I stay in their line of attack or if I approach them carelessly.\n\n### Strategy\n- I will move downward to position myself closer to the aliens, while staying clear of any bombs that could be in the way. There are bombs directly below at (5, 4) and (5, 5), but further down the path appears to be clear.\n\n### Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this downward move will get me closer to the aliens while attempting to avoid immediate danger from the bombs. This aligns with the strategy of taking out threats before they can attack the city."

As suggested in the strategy, I should reposition to maximize my ability to dodge attacks and plan a counter-action against aliens while keeping an eye on maintaining city health.\n\nTo proceed, I will move to the left towards (row 6, col 2), where there are no immediate threats, which will also get away from the bombs in (row 5, col 4) and (row 5, col 5).\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to dodge any potential blasts from bombs and keep my offensive options open against the nearby aliens.

Since you are currently at `(6, 2)` and want to move away from the immediate threats, the best course of action would be to move left to avoid the bombs.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will reposition your avatar away from the bombs, allowing for a safer area to engage any threats.
