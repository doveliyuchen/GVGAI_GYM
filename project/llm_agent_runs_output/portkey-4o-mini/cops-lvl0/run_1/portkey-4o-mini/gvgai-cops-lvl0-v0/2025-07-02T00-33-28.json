Therefore, it's best to move directly to the left (where the floor tile is) so that I can gather more information or resources in subsequent moves.\n\nThus, I will perform the action to move left to `(2, 10)`.\n\n```Action: 1```\nThe action is a left movement, which will allow us to explore further and possibly find resources or set up for future actions!"
