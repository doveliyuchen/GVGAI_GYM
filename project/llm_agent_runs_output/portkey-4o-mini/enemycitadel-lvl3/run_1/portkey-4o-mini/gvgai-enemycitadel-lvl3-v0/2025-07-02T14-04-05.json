Below (7, 10) and to the left (6, 9) are accessible tiles but also surrounded by boulders which may not lead to immediate interactions with enemies.\n\n### Strategy Review:\n1. To avoid enemies, it\u2019s wise to consider indirect paths.\n2. Interactions with crates could be pivotal in defeating enemies, which are located at (2, 1), (2, 13), (8, 8) and (9, 5).\n3. The goal is located at (8, 12), which indicates a need to navigate carefully downward to avoid direct confrontation and ideally use crates to defeat enemies while progressing towards the goal. \n\n### Planning the Next Action:\nMy next action should be to explore downward towards a potentially safe area and position myself better to interact with crates. As moving left (to 6, 9 with a crate) isn't promising, moving downwards is my primary option here.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThe expectation is to either have the ability to move further without encountering an enemy or prepare for strategic use of crates on upcoming turns."

There are no immediate obstacles in the left or right directions; however, moving down leads to a boulder which is an obstacle. Thus, moving left or right to eventually reach the lower row seems like a potential strategy.\n\n### Available Moves\n1. **Move Left (to row=5, col=11)**: This is an empty space that could be further navigated.\n2. **Move Right (to row=5, col=13)**: This is also an empty space.\n3. **Move Up (to row=4, col=12)**: This move would be to an empty space but will take the avatar further from the goal.\n4. **Move Down (to row=6, col=12)**: Cannot move down as it is blocked by a boulder.\n\nConsidering the above options, moving to the left or right does not directly bring the avatar closer to the goal on the next move, but moving left might allow for future openings down and across.\n\n### Decision\nSince the avatar\u2019s movement must change from the last action, the most strategic move is to go left into (row=5, col=11), which keeps options open for subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nMoving left provides potential pathways for navigating past the current obstacle (the boulder) while assessing the best route toward the goal."

Hence, the action I will take is:\n\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\n\n### Feedback\nThis action moves the avatar up one step which may provide a better vantage point to either interact with crates or move towards the goal, thereby aligning with the overall strategy of strategically maneuvering around obstacles and enemies. I expect to see a change in position leading potentially towards further actions that involve crates or moving toward the goal."

Notably, one of the quickest routes appears to be moving towards the right side of the map, since the goal is positioned at the far right at (8, 12).\n\n### Strategy for Action\n1. The avatar can attempt to move either down (to seek paths around walls and avoid the enemy) or to the right (where there are enemies still at some distance).\n2. Since the avatar's health points must be preserved and enemies are close, a cautious approach is recommended.\n\n### Chosen Action\nGiven that the avatar's position remains the same, I must choose an effective move. Moving down (to row 6) could provide a clearer view of available paths and accomplish a rotation while maintaining distance from enemies.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis move is expected to help in exploring potential pathways while keeping the avatar safe from immediate enemy threats.

Direct collision with it would lead to a loss of health.\n3. **Crates**: Several crates (`#`) are positioned at (2, 6) and (2, 7). These could potentially be used to defeat the enemy if moved correctly.\n4. **Goal**: The goal (`%`) is located at (8, 12), which is our destination.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation:\nThe immediate concern is to either avoid the enemy or manipulate the environment using crates to get closer to the goal while managing health points. Since the avatar's current position does not change, the goal is to take an action that either rotates towards a useful position or set up a plan for the next move.\n\n### Action Plan:\nSince the avatar can move right to (5, 11) without hitting an immediate wall or enemy, the next action to take is moving RIGHT. This allows the avatar to potentially move closer to the goal while reassessing the situation in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nMoving right to (5, 11) aligns with the strategy of avoiding enemies and exploring safer paths toward the goal.

Direct movement towards (8, 12) should be prioritized since it leads directly to the goal.\n2. Avoiding enemies is critical; the closest enemy is situated at (1, 10), which is quite far and therefore less of an immediate threat.\n3. The move must ensure that the avatar can move directly south toward the goal.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nI will attempt to move downward to (6, 12) on this turn as it brings me closer to the goal at (8, 12). \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down towards the goal, and I expect this brings the avatar one step closer to reaching the goal."
