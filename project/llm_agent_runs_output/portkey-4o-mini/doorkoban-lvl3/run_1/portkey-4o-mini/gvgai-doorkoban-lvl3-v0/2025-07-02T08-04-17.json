There are also doors that may restrict movement:\n   - The door at (6, 4) (`&`) and the exit at (7, 13) (`e`).\n\n### Move Strategy:\nFrom position (4, 9), you can:\n- Move to the left (4, 8) where there is no interaction but could plan a path towards the holes.\n- Move towards the hole at (4, 4) but would need to reposition boxes to do this efficiently.\n\n### Planned Action:\nSince you need to score points and the highest point hole is (4, 4) with a point associated, it is strategic to first consider moving left towards (4, 8) to set up for accessing the other areas of the map and create an opportunity to interact with the holes or boxes later.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow for further strategic movements towards holes or boxes in the following moves, especially with a focus on reaching the exit efficiently afterward."

The avatar's position is at (5, 9) on the grid.\n\nCurrently, the nearest holes and boxes are as follows:\n- **Hole (f) at (11, 1)** has the highest score multiplier available.\n- **Box ($) at (10, 4)** should be moved towards its respective hole to score.\n- There is also a **hole (c) at (10, 11)**, where another box can be utilized.\n- The exit (e) is located at (7, 13), which is relatively close.\n\nGiven the position of the avatar, I see that it can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from (5, 9). I will first need to check my possible adjacent movements to determine where I should go next.\n\nInitially, if I go UP from (5, 9):\n- Position (4, 9) is empty (.) allowing upward movement.\n\nThen, my potential next move from (4, 9) could be towards hole (f) (11, 1), or to the left or right exploring available paths.\n\nSince the first exploration won't result in any changes, I'll take my first action moving UP.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to see more of the grid and assess potential movements toward scoring and reaching exit points more efficiently."

To maximize scoring opportunities, a good strategy would be to push this box into one of the holes, preferably one that gives a higher score; however, the hole for box1 would not yield significant points since it is not currently adjacent to any hole.\n\nConsidering the immediate next steps, the avatar can either:\n1. Push the box on the right (4, 13) down towards hole3 (5, 4) or hole1 (6, 1).\n2. Move left towards an empty space to possibly navigate through.\n\nGiven that there are no other boxes nearby and the immediate goal is to start repositioning boxes for holes plus to reach lower holes, it seems favorable to step left first to avoid any blocking scenarios with the exit or boxes. \n\n**Next action:** Move left to (4, 8).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action allows the player to evaluate the surrounding game elements while maintaining positional flexibility. It's a reassuring step towards positioning for future actions since there are still several interactions to consider before finalizing movements toward the holes."

The closest immediate goal is to utilize the boxes around to interact with the corresponding holes to maximize your score. \n\nCurrently, the hole at (4, 4) can accept a box, and there is a box available at (4, 13).
