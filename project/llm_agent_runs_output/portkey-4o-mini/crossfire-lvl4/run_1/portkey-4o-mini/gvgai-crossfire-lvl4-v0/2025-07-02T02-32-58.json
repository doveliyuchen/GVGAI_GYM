This action allows you to have more maneuverability for future turns and keeps you in a safe space away from walls and turrets.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis leftward movement should assist in avoiding enemies while positioning yourself closer to potential pathways toward the goal located above."

Since I cannot go left or up due to walls, moving down is not productive either, with a wall present at (14, 4).\n\n### Next Step:\nTo change my position, I can move left or right. Moving left (to (13, 3)) does not lead to any immediate threats and would place me one step closer to adjusting my approach towards the goal above.\n\nI will execute the action to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action seems strategic as it allows me to reposition myself while avoiding immediate threats and prepares me for future moves towards the goal.

The avatar should be cautious of wall collisions, but there are no threats from turrets or bombs in this immediate vicinity.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince there is no movement from the previous action (as it's the initial state analysis), I should attempt to move left to explore my options further.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left might reveal new pathways or provide additional strategic positioning to navigate towards the goal safely."

The turrets are located in rows 3 and 4 (in columns 9 and 25, respectively), but they are some distance away and shouldn't pose an immediate threat if you move quickly.\n   \n2. **Safety Zones**: The positions around (12, 3) and (11, 3) seem relatively safe, as there are no immediate threats in the vertical path between your avatar and the goal.\n\n3. **Action Strategy**: \n   - The optimal strategy, given the layout, is to move **up** to (12, 3) first and then again **up** to (11, 3) in the following action to reach the goal.\n   - Since you've just moved, it's important to confirm movement. The action is simple as your position should change after an upward action.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **First Move**: Move from (13, 3) to (12, 3) with ACTION_UP.\n2. **Second Move**: If you reach (12, 3), the next MOVE would be to (11, 3), reaching the goal.\n\nFollowing the strategy and the above analysis, I will perform the first action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to move the avatar upward to (12, 3), which should help in progressing towards the goal while minimizing risk."

I will choose to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nBy moving left to (11, 8), I can further evaluate my surroundings and maintain progress towards the goal while remaining aware of threats from turrets and bombs."
