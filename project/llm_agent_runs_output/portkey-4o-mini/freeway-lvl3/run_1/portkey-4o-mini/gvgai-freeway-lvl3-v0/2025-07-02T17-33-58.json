If the avatar is on the same row (row 1) and to the left of the goal, move right.\n2. If the avatar is below the goal (e.g., row 2), moving up may be the suitable action if there's a clear path.\n\nAfter assessing the board layout, a reasonable action would be to move **up** (to row 1) if currently at row 2, or **right** if starting closer to the goal on row 1.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the avatar is currently on row 2, starting at the far left and needs to approach the goal.\n\nChosen Action:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action intends to move the avatar up toward the goal while ensuring safety from obstacles below.
