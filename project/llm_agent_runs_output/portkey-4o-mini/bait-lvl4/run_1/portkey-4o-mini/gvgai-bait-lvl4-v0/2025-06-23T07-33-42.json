Since I am in row 5 (on the row directly above the key), I want to move up towards row 4, which contains boxes and floor tiles that I can use to continue upwards. \n\n### Possible Actions\nFrom the current position (5, 3), if I move:\n- **UP** (to 4, 3): This will allow me to analyze the next row while preparing for further upward movement.\n- **LEFT** or **RIGHT** would lead me to walls and not move closer to the key.\n- **DOWN** would only take me down to row 6, which is away from the key and assures no progress.\n\n### Decision\nI will proceed with the action to move UP to continue towards collecting the key.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action should help in getting closer to the key, allowing me to analyze the next steps for reaching it safely."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, let's summarize the position of the avatar and the relevant objects around it. The avatar is located at coordinates `(4, 3)`.\n\nThe surroundings are as follows:\n- `A` (nokey floor) at `(4, 3)` - this indicates the avatar's current state of having no key.\n- Boxes (`@`) are located at `(3, 4)`, `(4, 2)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 2)`, `(5, 4)`, `(6, 2)`, `(6, 4)`.\n- The key (`%`) is located at `(1, 1)`.\n- Holes (`$`) are at `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, and `(6, 1)`.\n- The goal (`#`) is at `(7, 4)`.\n\n**Objective**: The primary goal is to reach the goal while collecting the key without falling into any holes.\n\n**Current Strategy**: The first step is to collect the key. To reach the key at `(1, 1)`, the avatar must navigate through its current position while avoiding hazards.\n\nThe current position is `(4, 3)`, with available moves being left to `(4, 2)`, right to `(4, 4)`, down to `(5, 3)` or up to `(3, 3)`. Notably, moving left to `(4, 2)` lands onto a box which could potentially be useful later.\n\nSince the key is several rows above and there are multiple holes directly above the avatar, the next action revolves around moving left to `(4, 2)` first.\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\nThis action is chosen as it prepares to either push the box on `(4, 4)` to the left/right or move upward to navigate toward the key when it is safe to do so, aligning with the strategy of maneuvering while considering hazards."

These must be avoided to prevent game over.\n5. **Boxes:** Boxes are present at (3, 4), (4, 4), and (5, 2), which can potentially help navigate around obstacles.\n\n### Next Steps:\nConsidering the avatar is positioned at (3, 2) and must reach (1, 1) to collect the key, the destination is clearly to the left at (1, 1). The avatars' movement should prioritize reaching the key while avoiding holes and other hazards. The block configuration behind and adjacent will require a strategy that does not risk movement into holes.\n\nThe action required should be to move the avatar left to position (3, 1). \n\nGiven the action plan:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is expected to place the avatar in a safer position to plan the next move without hitting obstacles or hazards."
