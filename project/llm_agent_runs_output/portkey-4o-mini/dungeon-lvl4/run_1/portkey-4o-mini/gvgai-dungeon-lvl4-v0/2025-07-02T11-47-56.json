The gold can be collected for points, while the key is necessary for passing through locked doors.\n\n3. **Note the Obstacles**:\n   Numerous obstacles are present, including walls, fireholes, boulders, and traps. We need to proceed with caution to avoid losing health.\n\n4. **Movement Strategy**:\n   We should determine whether our current position allows movement towards any of the objectives without entering a hazardous area. \n\nGiven these considerations and the game mechanics where rotation might precede movement, it would be prudent to either:\n- Collect a nearby resource if our avatar is adjacent to one.\n- Navigate towards the exit while avoiding hazards. \n\nSince I currently do not have the avatar's exact position, I will assume we need to check available options based on potential movement.\n\n### Action Decision:\nIf I were to assume I can move in a direction without obstacles:\n- If the avatar is close to gold or another item, I'd move towards it. \n- If in danger (near fire, traps, or potential hazards), I'd choose a non-hazardous path.\n\nFor now, I will take an initial action to move downwards (3) as a general precautionary move while scanning for the avatar's specific location.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action is a cautious step forward, allowing me to see if there are resources or the exit below.

However, we can analyze the surrounding layout to determine the best course of action towards achieving the goal of reaching the exit (`%`), while collecting resources along the way and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identifying Resources:**\n   - The map contains numerous gold resources (`*`) and a key (`b`) that can be collected.\n   - The exit (`%`) is located at coordinates (1, 20).\n   \n2. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - The layout includes walls (`l`) and potential hazards (fire `f`, boulders `1`, `2`, etc.) that must be avoided to maintain health.\n\n3. **Strategic Actions:**\n   - Given the resources and the exit's position, I will prioritize moving towards the gold and ensuring I do not engage with the fire or other harmful objects.\n\n### Action Decision:\nConsidering all the gathered information, I will opt for a directional action towards one of the accessible gold resources. If the avatar starts adjacent to gold at (1, 1), I will move there. This will set the avatar up to collect gold while also being close to the exits.\n\nSince I don't have a specific avatar position, let's assume a position that allows for movement.

Given that we know the objective is to reach the exit ('%') while avoiding hazards and managing health, I must first assess general strategic movement based on nearby resources and threats.\n\nUpon reviewing the map:\n\n1. The exit is located at (1, 20) on row 1, column 20.\n2. There are several sources of gold ('*') on rows 1, 4, 8, 11, and many others scattered around the map.\n3. Key ('k') locations can provide access to locked areas, displayed at rows 7, 12, and their potential importance cannot be overlooked as we may encounter locked areas on our way.\n\nGiven that action is necessary, and assuming the avatar is ideally positioned to make progress toward resources or navigate without immediately hitting a hazard, the most judicious initial action would be to explore toward a gold or useful key while simultaneously progressing toward the exit.\n\nIf we assume that the avatar is positioned near (1, 1), I would choose to move `RIGHT` toward potential gold located at (1, 2):\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to yield a resource without direct hazard engagement and bring the avatar closer to the exit while increasing score potential through the collection of gold, adhering to the suggested strategies for resource management and cautious navigation."

Moving closer to the exit must be balanced with resource collection while mitigating risk.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nBased on positioning and available actions, I will focus on moving downwards to explore the first resource while ensuring that I maintain my health and avoid traps.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nThis move aligns with resource collection strategy, allowing me to navigate towards the nearest gold item while being vigilant about potential hazards."

However, there is also the presence of hazards like the firehole ('&') that could threaten the avatar's health.\n\nBased on the strategy provided, I now prioritize collecting resources while steering clear from hazards, especially as I look towards reaching the exit.\n\nFrom the map, I can see that:\n\n- The avatar could potentially move towards collecting gold, which is available at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (4, 11). \n- Additionally, the key is located at (13, 7), which may be necessary to access parts of the map with locked areas.\n\nGiven that collecting gold increases our score and moving towards the exit is key, I will strategize my next action accordingly. However, since there\u2019s no specific movement indicated for the avatar, I will initiate a directional movement.\n\nSince there are walls surrounding the avatar and traps potentially affecting movement paths, I\u2019ll choose to act cautiously and will attempt to move down (ACTION_DOWN).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action allows me to begin towards the lower part of the map where more resources are available and assess the situation after moving.
