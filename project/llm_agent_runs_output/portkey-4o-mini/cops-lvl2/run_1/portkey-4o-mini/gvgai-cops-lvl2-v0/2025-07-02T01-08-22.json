Given that my position remains unchanged from the last state, I will move down into row 13:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n**Feedback:** This action will take the avatar down toward row 13 for exploration but keeps a cautious approach given the potential villains.

If thugs are present, engage with them efficiently to improve resources.\n3. Since I cannot see the key represented ('j') nearby, I will focus on my next move to either navigate towards thugs or recover positions that lead to objectives like the jail door.\n\n### Current Observations\n- I will need to find a way to work towards the key, but currently, there are no keys visible in my immediate vicinity.\n- The optimal strategy may involve engaging with a thug to build up resources. The closest thugs are at (4, 10), (4, 11), and (5, 11).\n\nTo advance my situation while keeping an eye on the jail door and potential encounters with thugs, I will move right towards (10, 4).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right keeps me within range of resources while aiming toward any potential encounters or items. I expect that this move will also provide options for the next turn, whether to continue engaging with nearby thugs or to reposition for strategic advantage."
