Below the avatar, the tiles are mostly blank (`=`) except at `(2, 14)` and `(2, 16)` which are `@` (fast cars). The goal portal `g` is at `(1, 10)`.\n\n### Objective:\nThe objective is to reach the green goal portal at `(1, 10)` while avoiding cars which can reduce health.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **Left (to 1, 17)**: This position is an open crossing tile, safe from any immediate hazards.\n2. **Right (to 1, 19)**: This position is also a crossing tile, meaning safe movement.\n3. **Down (to 2, 18)**: This space is open and does not contain any hazards.\n4. **Up (to 0, 18)**: This space is also open.\n\n### Analysis of Actions:\nSince I want to progress towards the goal, moving left to `(1, 17)` brings me closer to `(1, 10)` while avoiding immediate hazards. The car at `(2, 14)` is still something to consider, but for the immediate action, I will focus on safe movement towards the goal.\n\nBased on the analysis above and the current situation, I will choose to move left to position `(1, 17)`.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis movement should help me minimize my health risk while effectively moving towards the goal portal."

Moving left (ACTION_LEFT):\n   - This would bring the avatar to position (1, 11), which is occupied by a tree ('$'). This is an invalid move.\n2. Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT):\n   - This would bring the avatar to position (1, 13), which is clear and keeps the avatar in play.\n3. Moving down (ACTION_DOWN):\n   - This would bring the avatar to (2, 12) where there's '.' (open space).\n4. Moving up (ACTION_UP):\n   - This would bring the avatar to (0, 12) where there's '%', a wall.
