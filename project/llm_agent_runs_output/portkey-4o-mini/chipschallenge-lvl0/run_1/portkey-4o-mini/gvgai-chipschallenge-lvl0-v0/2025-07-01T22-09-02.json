The nearest noteworthy item is the yellow door at (row=9, col=8), which the avatar cannot pass through since there\u2019s no yellow key in their possession.\n\n2. **Immediate Strategy:**\n   - Since moving towards the yellow door doesn\u2019t yield any fruitful outcome, the next step should either explore collecting nearby workable resources, such as chips, or repositioning to gather keys or other items available on the map.\n\n3. **Proposed Action:**\n   - Moving **down** to (row=9, col=9), which is a ground tile, is a good step. This will allow access to a new row where exploration options may yield door keys or more chips.\n\nNow I will perform the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to allow better access to explore the lower row where further items or movement options can be evaluated."

The avatar has several options to move, and it's important to keep progressing towards the exit while also collecting chips.\n\n### Strategy Review\nSince the avatar hasn't moved since the last state, we want to ensure our next action leads to a meaningful change. We should consider our path towards increasing our score by collecting chips and reaching the exit (which is at (2, 7)).\n\n### Deciding Next Action\nThe most significant immediate goal is to make progress towards the exit. Moving down to (9, 7) is a reasonable choice, as it leads us closer to the lower part of the map where the exit is located and may allow us to explore any potential collectibles there.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to lead us closer to a useful path while moving towards our end goal."

Since my avatar needs to navigate towards the exit and potentially gather chips along the way, I need to consider the next best action.\n\nSince the avatar is currently facing right, I will maneuver towards the right side since there are spaces available and it will allow for exploration without hitting a wall. \n\nI will take the action: \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action will help to advance towards more open space or potential collectibles as part of the strategy to navigate efficiently towards the exit."

This will allow us to assess if we can navigate better toward the left side to find keys and explore more of the environment.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left appears to be a safe action that could lead to further opportunities to collect items or find more routes toward the exit."
