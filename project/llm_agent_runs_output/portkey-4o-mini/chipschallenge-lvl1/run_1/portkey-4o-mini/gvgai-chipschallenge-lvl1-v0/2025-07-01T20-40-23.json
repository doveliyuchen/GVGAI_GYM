The immediate surrounding in the level includes a mix of empty spaces (`.`), resources such as chips (`@`) and a fire (`%`). The exit (`$`) is located at (9, 10). The primary goal is to navigate to the exit while managing resources.\n\n### Current Position and Nearby Elements:\n- **Avatar Position:** (7, 5)\n- **1 Step Left (7, 4):** A regular floor (`.`).\n- **1 Step Right (7, 6):** A regular floor (`.`).\n- **1 Step Up (6, 5):** A resource (`.`).\n- **1 Step Down (8, 5):** A resource (`#`).\n- **2 Steps Down (9, 5):** A resource (`@`).\n- **2 Steps Right (9, 10):** Exit (`$`).\n\n### Feasible Actions:\n- Moving left (7, 4) or right (7, 6) doesn't bring immediate hazards or additional resources. \n- Moving up (6, 5) will put the avatar in a blank space (`.`).\n- Moving down (8, 5) will return to a crate (`#`), which does not help to collect resources or towards the exit.\n  \nSince there are no immediate hazards in the left or right moves, and considering the exit's position, I should move towards areas where I might collect more chips to increase my score.\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving **right** to (7, 6) keeps my options open while allowing further movements towards (9, 10), where the exit is located.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis choice allows me to continue exploring pathways to the exit while remaining safe from hazards. I expect to assess new options after this move to continue towards victory."
