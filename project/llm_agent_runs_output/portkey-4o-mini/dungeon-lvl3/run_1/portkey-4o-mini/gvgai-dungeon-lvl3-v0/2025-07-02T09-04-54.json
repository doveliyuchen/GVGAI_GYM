The most immediate action is to move towards the exit, located at (4, 4), while avoiding pitfalls like fireholes and boulders.\n\nGiven the current layout, the best course of action is to move UP to (16, 20), ensuring that my avatar potentially gets closer to navigating through the locks later or interacting with other items without immediate danger.\n\nThus, I will take the action: \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis upward movement allows me to avoid further hazards while progressing towards potential resource collection."
