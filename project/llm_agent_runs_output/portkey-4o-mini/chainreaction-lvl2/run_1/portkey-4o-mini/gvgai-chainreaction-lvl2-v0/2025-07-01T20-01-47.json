This action allows the avatar to remain in between the lower and mid parts of the map and might provide more strategic positioning options for subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving upwards keeps options open for future turns and avoids immediate hazards."

    "content": "To determine the next action for the avatar located at (7, 10) on the map, we need to evaluate the surroundings and potential moves based on the game mechanics and current state.\n\n### Current Position:\n- **Avatar (a)** is at position (7, 10).\n- Adjacent positions:\n  - (7, 9): floor (.)\n  - (7, 11): floor (.)\n  - (6, 10): floor (.)\n  - (8, 10): floor (.)\n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n1. **Available Moves**:\n   - **Up (to (6, 10))**: Valid move (floor).\n   - **Down (to (8, 10))**: Valid move (floor).\n   - **Left (to (7, 9))**: Valid move (floor).\n   - **Right (to (7, 11))**: Valid move (floor).\n\n2. **Goal Consideration**: \n   - No direct path to the goal (`g`) is present at this moment, but moving in any direction opens up more potential pathways.\n\n3. **Strategic Move**: \n   - Moving **up or down** may help evaluate potential interactions with adjacent boulders or boxes, while moving **left** or **right** might help clear more paths.\n\nGiven the focus on managing the boulders and ensuring the avatar's safety (avoiding holes), a strategic action would be to move **down** to (8, 10), which will allow for further exploration in the next turn.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing to move **down** may provide opportunities to evaluate the environment further below and will maintain game play continuity without putting the avatar at risk.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to explore more of the grid below, aligning well with the strategy of ensuring safe navigation towards the goal."

The only immediate direction to reach the goal from the avatar's current position `(8, 10)` is to move right to `(8, 11)`, which is the goal.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nSince the right action `(ACTION_RIGHT)` will lead directly to the goal without risk of falling into a hole, it's clear that we should proceed with this action.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right into the goal should conclude the level successfully, aligning with the game strategy of reaching the goal effectively and avoiding any obstacles."
