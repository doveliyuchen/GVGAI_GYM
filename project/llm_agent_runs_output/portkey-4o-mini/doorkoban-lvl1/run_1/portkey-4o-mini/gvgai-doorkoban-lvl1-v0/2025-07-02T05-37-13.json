There's a box located at (8, 1), a hole below my avatar at (9, 5), and the exit is at (5, 8).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- I can't move left or right as those positions are blocked by walls.\n- Moving down to (10, 1) is open but does not provide new opportunities.\n- Moving up to (8, 1) will allow me to interact with the box.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the only move that allows me to interact with a box is moving up to (8, 1), I need to take that action first. This could potentially allow me to push the box and maybe place it into a hole or reach necessary locations later that can help towards my objective of reaching the exit.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up to interact with the box seems to be the best option for making progress in the current layout. I expect this action will provide additional strategic options for placing boxes in holes or clearing pathways through further interactions."

Currently, it's necessary to move left (to col 1) in order to access the box.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nThis action will allow the avatar to move left to position (row 9, col 1), which will position it next to the box for future interactions. I expect this action to align with the strategy of moving closer to the box while exploring options for placing it in the hole for score maximization."

    "content": "To navigate this level, the main objective is to interact with the boxes and holes in such a way that we can either score points or unlock the exit. \n\nCurrently, the avatar (`a`) is located at position (9, 1). Nearby, we have:\n- Box (`@`) at (8, 1)\n- Hole (`h`) at (9, 5)\n- Box (`%`) at (9, 9)\n- Wall (`w`) surrounding the area, providing limited movement options.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Objective Identification:** The avatar needs to score points or unlock the exit. The box at (8, 1) can be moved.\n2. **Possible Actions:** \n   - The avatar can interact by moving the box at (8, 1) towards the hole at (9, 5), which is currently blocked.\n   - Alternatively, the avatar can assess moving towards another box or up to higher rows to clear pathways or achieve other goals.\n\nGiven the current position and interactions available, the avatar might need to rotate first to access either the box or the hole and then plan the next action.\n\n### Selected Action:\nSince the avatar is positioned at (9, 1), I will attempt to move the avatar left to check for a clear path or rotation.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will allow me to assess the space and possibly yield a different perspective on how to interact with the nearby box or hole."
