I notice that the lever to the left (at (row 8, col 31)) is available, which corresponds to the action to the left.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I will perform:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is to pull the lever to the left, which allows me to evaluate the potential effects on the surrounding sprites and see if it opens up further interaction opportunities. I expect this action to create some strategic openings in the game environment to increase my chances of interactions with the passengers."

We must avoid these at all costs to prevent losing points.\n- **Wall sprites** and other obstacles exist throughout the map. \n\nAccording to the mechanics of the game, my avatar is also on a belt segment, so it's important to note that movement on the belt may be constrained.\n\n### Current Action Analysis:\n1. **Movement Constraints**: The avatar may need to rotate before moving, and since the intended direction matters, we must make sure the avatar is rotating correctly toward the intended target.\n2. **Goal**: Reach the passenger at (9, 3) effectively while managing the suitcases without colliding with a wall or death sprite.\n\n### Action Plan:\nI will first attempt to move my avatar out of the way if it has not already moved.
