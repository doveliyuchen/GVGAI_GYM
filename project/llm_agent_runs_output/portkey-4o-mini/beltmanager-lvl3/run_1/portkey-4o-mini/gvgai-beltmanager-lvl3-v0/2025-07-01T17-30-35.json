This means it's a few rows above the avatar.\n- There\u2019s a passenger at (row=9, col=3) one position to the left of the avatar.\n- The main concern is whether movement of my avatar can cause the suitcase to collide with any walls or death sprites.\n\n**First action consideration:**\n- My avatar should move left (to collect the passenger at (row=9, col=3)).\n\nI'll execute the action and move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move should successfully collect the passenger and keeps the suitcase in a safe position while moving closer to the win condition."
