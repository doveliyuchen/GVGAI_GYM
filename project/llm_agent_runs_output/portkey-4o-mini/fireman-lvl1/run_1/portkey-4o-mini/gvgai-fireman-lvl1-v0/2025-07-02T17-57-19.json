The avatar is currently located at (4, 1), surrounded by walls and spaces where it can potentially move.\n2. There are a few fires in the vicinity located at (1, 11), (1, 12), and (4, 14).

The available actions are limited due to the walls surrounding the avatar.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **Up (ACTION_UP)** would move to (3, 1), still blocked by walls.\n- **Down (ACTION_DOWN)** would move to (5, 1), still moving into empty ground without gaining significant advantage.\n- **Left (ACTION_LEFT)** would move to (4, 0), which is also surrounded by walls.\n- **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** would move to (4, 2), and lead to more empty ground.\n- **Use (ACTION_USE)** would gather resources since there is an extinguisher located at (2, 6).\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven the limitations, the action that makes the most strategic sense is to move **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** from (4, 1) to (4, 2).

The nearest fire sprite `$` is at positions (1, 11), (1, 12), (4, 14), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (9, 6).\n\nGiven the urgency to manage resources and extinguish fires, a movement action is needed:\n\n1. Moving towards (6, 3) would allow you to assess if there's an approaching fire from that direction.\n2. You can prepare to navigate towards extinguishing the fire near (5, 8) or further exploring the area for more water ammo.\n\nThus, the most immediate and strategic action is to move downwards toward (6, 3):\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action allows exploration and positioning for the next turn to respond to any fire threats.
