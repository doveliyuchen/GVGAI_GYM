To successfully reach the goal ('$') at (row=1, col=13), I need to navigate upward and avoid the hazards present, such as walls ('&') and water ('*').\n\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: (8, 18)\n2. **Goal Position**: (1, 13)\n3. **Surrounding Area**: \n   - Above (row=7, col=18): '.' (empty)\n   - Left (row=8, col=17): '%' (log water)\n   - Right (row=8, col=19): '%' (log water)\n   - Below (row=9, col=18): '&' (wall)\n\nGiven the information:\n- Above me is free space (.), which I can move to.\n- The logs to the left and right indicate I can use those for crossing the water if necessary, but my immediate goal is to move upward towards the goal.\n\nSince I have not moved from my last action, I will take the action to move **up**.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up should get me closer to the goal while keeping me clear of walls and water. I will observe the new position for opportunities to navigate further towards the goal."
