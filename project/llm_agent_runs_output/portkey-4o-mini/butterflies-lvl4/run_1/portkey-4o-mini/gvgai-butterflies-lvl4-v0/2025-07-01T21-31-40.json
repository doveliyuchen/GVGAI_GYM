Since there are butterflies further left on row 10 and I cannot move up due to the wall, the most appealing actions to continue my strategy effectively would be to start moving left from the current position.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to move left into the empty space (10, 6), positioning me closer to the butterflies in subsequent turns and maintaining avoidance of hazards as I navigate the map."
