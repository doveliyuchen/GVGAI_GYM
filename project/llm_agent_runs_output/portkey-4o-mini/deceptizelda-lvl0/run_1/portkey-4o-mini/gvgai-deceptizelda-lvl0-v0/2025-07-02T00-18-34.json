This offers a significant scoring opportunity.\n- **Small Goal (represented by &):** Located at (10, 11). This is also accessible but provides fewer points.\n\nGiven that I don't see my avatar's position, which is crucial for determining possible next steps, my first action would ideally be aimed at ensuring I can engage with the interactive elements nearby, particularly the key.\n\nSince I can't see my exact position, if I assume that I'm currently adjacent (or in a position to potentially reach it), I will proceed with an action in the right direction of the key. Given my avatar's essential role, I might attempt to move towards it (if adjacent) or check the effectiveness of directional actions.\n\nMy first action should be:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action moves me to the right, which would be toward the key if I were currently within proximity. \n\nThe expectation is to either collect the key or assess how to further navigate if my avatar hasn't changed its position significantly with such a rotation move.
