My next move should focus on getting closer to the butterflies. \n\n### Suggested Action:\nTo safely approach the butterflies, I will move **UP** to position (8, 15).\n\n```Action:3```\n\nFeedback: Moving up will bring the avatar closer to the butterflies, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing butterfly elimination without immediately engaging, allowing for a better position next turn."

You should prioritize eliminating these butterflies.\n2. **Cocoon Placement**: The cocoons are located at (9, 4) and (9, 24). Kiwi adjusting the cocoon count could potentially increase the number of butterflies if interacted upon incorrectly.\n3. **Next Move Options**: Since there are walls in the vicinity, you want to navigate carefully to avoid getting blocked or having your movement restricted.\n\n### Strategy:\n- First, target the nearest butterfly because they directly contribute to winning the game. Therefore, you should focus on moving up to engage with the butterflies.\n\n### Planned Action:\n- Move **UP** from (9, 15) to (8, 15), and then you can move to engage the butterfly at (8, 22) next turn, assuming it stays there.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will help advance toward the butterflies, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing butterfly elimination."
