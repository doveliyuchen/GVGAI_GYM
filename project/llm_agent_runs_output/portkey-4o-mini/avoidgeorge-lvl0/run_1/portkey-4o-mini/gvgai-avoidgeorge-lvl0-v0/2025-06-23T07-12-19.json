Your options to move are limited to:\n   - Up (to (4, 9)): a wall; not possible.\n   - Right (to (5, 10)): an empty space; possible.\n   - Down (to (6, 9)): a wall; not possible.\n   - Left (to (5, 8)): a wall; not possible.\n   \nSince moving up, down, or left is blocked by walls, your only valid movement option is to the right (to (5, 10)).\n\n### Action Decision:\nTherefore, the next logical action given the current layout would be:\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right to (5, 10) allows you to progress while avoiding being caught by George and keeping potential interactions with Quiet NPCs in mind.
