Moving south is viable since (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) contain crates. \n\n### Strategic Move:\nTo make meaningful progress toward the goal and avoid any potential threats, the suggestion would be:\n- Move left towards the nearest crate and subsequently strategize on how to either push or use this crate to either block the enemy or facilitate access to the goal.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I will take the action:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis means moving left (to row=4, col=3) to prepare to push crates or create a suitable route towards the goal.\n\n**Feedback on the action:** This move does not immediately reach the goal but positions the avatar closer to the crates, allowing for further tactical decisions afterward while remaining safe."

If I move **RIGHT** (8, 6), I will be near more crates and can start clearing a path in that direction if necessary.\n3.

The objective is to clear the goal ('$') at (4,1) while avoiding reducing my health to zero.\n\nGiven the next possible moves of my avatar and the surrounding entities, I need to make a strategic choice.\n\n### Current Evaluation:\n- The first target should be the goal at (4,1).\n- Closest way to approach that goal would involve moving through available crates while avoiding enemies and potential dead ends.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **ACTION_UP (4,6)** would move to (4,6), which is empty.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (6,6)** would move to (6,6), also empty.\n- **ACTION_LEFT (5,5)** would move to (5,5), which is empty.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (5,7)** would move to (5,7), which is empty.\n\nAll moves seem to be safe in terms of avoiding enemies as no immediate enemy contact would occur.\n\nTo progress towards the goal, moving up to (4,6) could help position me closer to further maneuvers.

The avatar is positioned at (row 4, col 6), which appears to have multiple crates and the goal just below it at (row 4, col 1). \n\nGiven the situation, here\u2019s the relevant analysis:\n\n1. **Avatar Position:** The avatar at (4, 6) can interact with nearby crates and possibly navigate towards the goal.\n2. **Potential Enemies:** There are enemies nearby (at (1, 10) and (7, 10)), but they are far enough that moving towards them isn't immediately dangerous.\n3. **Goals:** The goal at (4, 1) needs to be reached, and it should be prioritized.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- Left (to (4, 5)): This would move the avatar towards an open space and get closer to the goal.\n- Right (to (4, 7)): This leads into an open space but moves further from the goal.\n- Down (to (5, 6)): This also leads to an open space.\n- Up (to (3, 6)): This leads to an open space but does not directly move towards the goal.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best option is to move left to (4, 5) as it keeps the avatar on track towards navigating to the goal area and avoids unnecessary confrontations or complications.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action will allow the avatar to move left, bringing it closer to manipulating crates that can ultimately lead to clearing the goals without encountering enemies."
