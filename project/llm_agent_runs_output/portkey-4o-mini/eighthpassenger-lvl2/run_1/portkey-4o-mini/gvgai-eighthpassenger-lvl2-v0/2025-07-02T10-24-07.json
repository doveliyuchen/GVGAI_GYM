First, I should consider moving towards the right as my next action, as this leads me closer to where I need to go. The first obstacle that could block me is walls, but I see that moving right (8, 3 to 8, 4) leads to an empty space.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis right move is strategically sensible as it aligns with approaching the exit while avoiding any immediate threats.
