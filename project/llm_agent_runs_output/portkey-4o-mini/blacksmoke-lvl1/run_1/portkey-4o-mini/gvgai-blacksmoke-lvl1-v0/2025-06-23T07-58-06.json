Analyzing the map around the avatar, the immediate surroundings consist of additional boxes '@', death ground '$', and the exit ground 'b' located at (11, 1).\n\nYour next effective move should focus on exploring the nearby area to collect resources while ensuring you don\u2019t encounter any hazards that could lead to your avatar's death. Since it's essential to manage your resources and avoid locks while carrying keys, I recommend moving to a safer position or towards collected boxes to potentially score points.\n\nWith these factors considered, a prudent action would be to move right to (3, 11) where there are two boxes '@'. This move aligns with the strategy of resource collection while avoiding immediate dangers.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should help in gathering boxes, thereby increasing your score, while being mindful of keeping the avatar safe from threats and navigating toward the exit in future moves."
