The next logical actions would be towards the right (2) or up (4) since up-left (1) or left may not yield a movement because the immediate hazard in the up-left direction.\n\nNavigating carefully, I will **move UP** to position (11,10) as the first move since it still keeps me moving towards the goal without approaching holes or hazards immediately.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is expected to move my avatar up towards (11, 10) and keep progressing towards the goal."
