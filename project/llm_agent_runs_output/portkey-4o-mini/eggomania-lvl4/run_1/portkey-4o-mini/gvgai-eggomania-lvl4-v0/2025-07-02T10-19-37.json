The avatar is currently located at (row=12, col=1), which is in a relatively open area without immediate blocking walls.\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n- There are several eggs ('e') on the map that the avatar can collect, primarily located in rows 5 to 11 along various columns.\n- Chickens and broken eggs are not present in close proximity to the avatar, allowing for safe movement.\n- It's crucial to collect resources while avoiding broken eggs, which means I should prioritize moving towards those egg sprites.\n\n### Analysis of Actions:\n1. **ACTION_USE (1)**: Would not be effective now, as there are no immediate threats to engage with explosive eggs.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Moving left (to col=0) is blocked by a wall ('%').\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Moving right (to col=2) will lead me to an empty space, allowing the potential to further navigate towards the eggs in column 5 to 11.\n\nSince the avatar's current position does not allow for movement left, I will opt to move right towards an empty square to open up additional options for movement in subsequent turns.\n\nI will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy to explore available paths while potentially setting up the opportunity to collect eggs next turn."

Therefore, the selected action is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow the avatar to collect a nearby explosive egg in the next action and maintain an optimal strategy going forward."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I see that my avatar ('a') is positioned at (12, 3) on the map. The task is to manage the incoming threats (chickens) effectively while collecting resources (explosive eggs) and maintaining a safe position.\n\nRight now, I need to act strategically based on the positions of resources and enemies. Here is the current environment:\n\n- **Nearby eggs**: There's an egg at (6, 5), (6, 26), (7, 27), (9, 3), (9, 4), (11, 27), and (11, 28). \n- **Chickens**: We have fast chickens at (1, 21) and (1, 22). \n- **Walls**: Many walls surround the area, particularly limiting my movements.\n\nSince my last position does not change, I should consider my options carefully. From my current position at (12, 3), moving left or right may keep me in position as the immediate threats are in other rows.\n\nMoving left to (12, 2) will not yield immediate threats, allowing me to prepare for collecting eggs in a safe environment. However, this would not affect the chicken's behavior as they are not in the immediate vicinity.\n\nThus, I will **move left** to position myself further for the incoming resources on my next action or to evade potential threats.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis should help me reposition strategically as there are multiple egg resources to my left that I can target on future turns, contributing to ammunition collection while staying out of reach of the chickens for now. I expect to see a clear path towards the resources next turn."
