The objective of the game is to collect at least 10 gold resources and reach the goal. Since the avatar's current position is only two spaces away from the goal, it is critical to evaluate whether any gold resources can be collected on the way.\n\n### Strategy Assessment:\n1. **Goal is Located at (2,2)**: The avatar is already on the goal.\n2. **Gold Resource Requirement**: However, we need at least 10 gold. From the current map, there is no indication of any gold resources ('A') collected.\n\nSince we have not collected any gold yet and are at the goal position, we must focus on exploring horizontally or vertically to find gold before approaching the goal.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe immediate surroundings of the avatar (in the context of what is visible) do not show any gold resources below (row 3 or higher) or laterally. The next steps could involve either continuing to search for gold in rows below, right, or left. Moving left to find more space to explore seems a reasonable tactic considering there\u2019s no gold in immediate view.\n\nThus, the best move is to proceed with:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis left movement might allow exploration of more areas where gold can be potentially found."

Logical deduction suggests the avatar might still be alive given that there are no indicators of deaths or lost resources.\n\nNext, to determine a strategic move, we need to identify the possible interactions:\n\n- The player must collect at least 10 gold resources before reaching the goal door to win.\n- The environment suggests multiple opportunities for exploration, resource collection, and potential combat against enemies or interactions with traps.\n\nFollowing an effective strategy based on the game rules and mechanics:\n1. The immediate next step should be to ensure safe navigation while staying vigilant for any traps and enemies.\n2. If the avatar has not moved previously, a basic action of moving right (towards a '.' space or interacting with the environment) could yield beneficial results (like exploring for gold).\n  \nFor the selected action:\n- I will move **Right** (2) as my first action to explore the space directly adjacent to the avatar.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action allows me to uncover what lies in the right space, expanding my options for exploration, resource collection, or combat.

Explore nearby spaces to maximize the chance of finding gold resources.\n2. Movement must be cautious to avoid dangerous traps and enemies.\n\n### Chosen Action\nI will proceed with moving **DOWN**, as it opens access to potential resources below the avatar.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect moving down will reveal more about the nearby spaces and possibly yield gold resources essential for fulfilling the objective."

Since action from prior interactions isn't provided, it's crucial to establish the most meaningful action based on the general objective to reach the goal while acquiring resources.\n3. **Considering the goal**, it appears reachable within further proximities.\n\n### Available Actions Consideration\n- The existing layout suggests various floors (.), walls (w), traps (+, -, /), moves up (u), down (d), and necessary swords (*, &), giving us potential advantageous actions.\n- Observations around the current position indicate that engaging in less risky actions (stepping left or right to explore resource areas and avoiding walls) may be sensible.\n\n### Recommended Action\nWithout knowing the avatar's exact position, to maintain an explorational strategy according to the given framework, it would make sense to explore adjacent areas that increase proximity to the goal or reveal resources. \n\nI recommend moving **right (ACTION_RIGHT)** if it ideally leads towards more resource (chips/swords) or closer to accessible floor areas that can aid further exploration.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is aimed at enhancing positional advantage and evaluating spatial relevance to the goal at (2, 2)."

We need to first ensure we have gathered enough gold; however, the map does not indicate any gold nearby, and the avatar's current position is directly on the goal.\n2. The win condition requires the player to collect a maximum of 10 gold resources, but it's unclear where any are at this point.\n3. Since the avatar is on the goal door '@', to win the game we must ensure we have collected the required resources prior to moving to the goal.\n\nGiven that the avatar is currently at the goal, there seems to be no gold collected based on prior state observations. Thus, the action to take here should align with ensuring to gather resources beforehand.\n\n### Decision on Action\nSince there is no movement possible directly in this step to achieve the condition (as the avatar is already on the goal), and we need to explore more thoroughly for gold before heading to the goal.\n\nIn this case, I will act upon my current position and explore the immediate accessible tiles.\n\n``` Action: ACTION_LEFT ```\nThis action is to check if there is any collectible resource to the left (col 1); if not, I will reassess and move further down to investigate. Expected outcome is that if there's accessible resource nearby, it can lead us towards gathering gold effectively."

However, from the analysis of the lower levels where occurrences of 'e' exist, the avatar seems to be at (2, 2), right next to the goal '@'.\n\n### Action Analysis\n1. The immediate goal is to collect resources, but since we are right next to the goal (which is '@'), we only need at least 10 gold resources. \n2. There is no enemy or trap directly in our way (the way to the goal is clear).\n3. There are hidden items and resources to explore, but without actual gold resources visible nearby.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the objective here is to reach the goal with at least 10 gold resources collected, if the avatar has at least collected that amount of gold resources in prior actions, the best action to take would be to proceed towards the goal.\n\nWithout seeing other gold resources or knowing if we have collected the required gold, we may need to simply move towards the goal location.\n\n### Recommended Action\nBased on our analysis, if we are at (2, 2) and we\u2019re ready to move towards the goal, the action should be:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action signifies moving to the right towards the goal door.

The closest available actions should involve either moving left, right, up, or down from my current position.\n2. Looking at the map, there are no resource icons immediately nearby that I can access without moving.\n3. Given the gameplay strategy, I should prioritize collecting resources before engaging with the goal door.\n\nCurrently, if I take a right action, it keeps me where I am, but if I take an upward action, theoretically, I may be able to find resources or paths leading to more gold.\n\n### Action Decision\nTo ensure I stay in line with my objective of collecting gold and nearing the goal without engaging in combat, I will proceed to explore upward to the previous row where I last had an opportunity to gather resources.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action allows me to explore upwards, and I hope to find additional gold resources to collect.

Therefore, I need to explore further to find gold resources.\n\n### Next Action\nI need to assess my options. The directions I can move in are **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, **UP**, and **DOWN**. Since I will not yield results by trying to reach the goal directly, I will explore movements to the edges of the map where I might find hidden gold resources.\n\nGiven the immediate surroundings:\n- LEFT (to (2,1)) is empty ('.').\n- RIGHT (to (2,3)) is also empty ('.').\n- UP (to (1,2)) is also empty ('.').\n- DOWN (to (3,2)) is empty ('.').\n\nSince all surrounding tiles are empty and don't seem promising for finding gold, the next step would logically be to explore one of the edges.\n\n### Choosing an Action\nI will move **DOWN** to explore further, hoping to explore new tiles below which may uncover hidden resources.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will allow me to explore the tile directly below, keeping in line with the strategy to explore thoroughly for gold resources. I expect to find new areas that may have hidden gold or other beneficial items."
