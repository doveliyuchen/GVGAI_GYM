Prioritize moving towards supplies to enhance my resource management.\n2. Ensure that I maintain distance from enemies while making my approach.\n\n**Action Decision:**\nSince my avatar needs to maneuver to potentially collect ammunition from (6, 11), the most efficient movement would be to go downwards to row 6 and closer to the supply.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move down one row. \n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis move allows me to position myself closer to the supply while minimizing immediate conflict with enemy sprites. I will expect to see if my approach to the supply holds any further potential for resource gathering."
