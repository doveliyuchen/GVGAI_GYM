The objective is to navigate towards this exit while managing the boxes and avoiding holes ('$') and walls ('%').\n\nTo formulate an action, I notice that moving left (to (7, 10)) is blocked by a wall, and moving down (to (8, 11)) would also be blocked. This leaves me to consider moving right (to (7, 12)), which is also blocked by a wall. The only viable action is to move up (to (6, 11)), which may lead to further opportunities as the next row has a hole on the left but could set up for movement options afterwards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action to allow exploration of the area above, possibly setting up future moves while keeping the avatar safe from holes."

However, we need to be cautious of the hazardous holes and walls. \n\nSince the avatar's current position is near the bottom of the map, a feasible action would be to move in a direction that allows the avatar to explore the upper levels toward the exit, which requires moving up.\n\n### Recommended Action\nThe most strategic immediate action is to move **up** to (row 6, col 11):\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move should position the avatar safely above, while also enabling further movement options toward the exit in subsequent turns, maintaining focus on effective box management and exploration."
