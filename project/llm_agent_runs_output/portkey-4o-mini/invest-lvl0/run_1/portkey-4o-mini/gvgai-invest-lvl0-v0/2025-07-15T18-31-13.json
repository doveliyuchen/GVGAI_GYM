The surrounding tiles accessible from this position provide open spaces for movement.\n\nSince we aim to prioritize coin collection and strategically manage our interactions with the switches, I need to analyze the directions available: \n\n- **Left (col=5)**: This takes me to (row=3, col=5) \u2192 It's a floor tile ('.').\n- **Right (col=7)**: This takes me to (row=3, col=7) \u2192 It's a floor tile ('.').\n- **Up (row=2)**: This takes me to (row=2, col=6) \u2192 It's a floor tile ('.').\n- **Down (row=4)**: This takes me to (row=4, col=6) \u2192 It's a floor tile ('.').\n\nAll the directions are valid, but the next goal is strategic. I can see Switch 2 located at (row=1, col=6) which I would eventually want to activate for a bonus of +15 points and extra 60 seconds.\n\nHowever, moving to (row=1, col=6) is not possible directly from (row=3, col=6) unless I first go to (row=2, col=6) or take a longer path around. \n\nThus, I will choose to move **up to (row=2, col=6)** first to create a pathway toward interacting with Switch 2.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should move me closer to reaching Switch 2 and allow for further planning in the next moves."

The surrounding layout contains walls ('w') on the top and bottom rows, and many empty spaces ('.') which are navigable. To maximize my score, I need to prioritize reaching coins ('c') and switches ('s', 'k', 'p') while avoiding walls.\n\nFrom my position at (2, 6):\n- To the left (move to col=5): (2, 5) is empty ('.').\n- To the right (move to col=7): (2, 7) is empty ('.').\n- Moving up (to row=1): (1, 6) is a switch ('k').\n- Moving down (to row=3): (3, 6) is empty ('.').\n\nThe optimal move would be to interact with the switch ('k') located above my avatar. Therefore, I will perform the action to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up will allow me to activate Switch 2, which could significantly impact my time and score positively."
