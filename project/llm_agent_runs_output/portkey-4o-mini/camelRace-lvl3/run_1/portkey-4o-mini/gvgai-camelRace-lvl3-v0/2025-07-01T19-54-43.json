However, I need to determine if this move can be executed without colliding with any walls or camels.\n\n- If we move right from (4, 7) to (4, 8), it is open.\n- Subsequently, we can analyze if this puts us in a better position to reach the goal, considering the camels' positions.\n\nThus, the next logical action is to:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n**Feedback**: Moving right should place the avatar in a clearer path toward the goal while allowing for observation of camel movement in the next turn.

There are various camels moving about the map that may pose a threat to my approach. Observing the walls and available paths, I need to maneuver towards the goal without getting blocked or intercepted by the camels.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\nGiven that I am at (7, 7), moving down (to (8, 7)) is an option, but it won't allow advance towards the goal at (1, 46) since it\u2019s a wall downwards. The next best direction is moving right to (7, 8). \n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis should move the avatar one position to the right (to (7, 8)).

The avatar itself is currently unmentioned, which implies it may be in one of the rows and hasn't been actively indicated on the current map. The focus here is on the location of camels (denoted as '@') which are situated at positions (2, 29), (2, 30), (3, 29), (3, 30), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 7), and (7, 8).\n\nFrom our current understanding:\n- The goal (green door) is at (1, 46).\n- There are camels positioned in such a way that their movement towards the goal could block the avatar's path to victory.\n- You need a meaningful action that aligns with the strategies mentioned earlier:\n  - Avoid obstacles (walls).\n  - Navigate before camels reach their destination.\n\nSince the state does not specify the current avatar position, I will assume a potential position to navigate toward the goal.
