The avatar has no immediate damage risk; however, moving directly towards the goal involves overcoming walls and navigating a maze of boxes.\n\n### Analyzing Direction:\nCurrently, the potential directional moves from (9, 10) are:\n- **Left (9, 9)**: Wall\n- **Right (9, 11)**: Empty space\n- **Up (8, 10)**: Wall\n- **Down (10, 10)**: Wall \n\nSince moving left into the wall is blocked, the upward move is also blocked by a wall, down move is also blocked. The only viable movement is to the right (9, 11).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed from the last analysis, and considering the available actions, the next step should be to move to the right to access unobstructed space for potential maneuvering.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action to create more room for maneuverability, aligning with the strategy of navigating towards the goal and working around obstacles systematically."

However, since moving left to `(9, 9)` would not lead directly toward the goal and could become trapped by walls adjacent to that column.\n\n### Suggested Action\nConsidering all factors and using optimal moves towards the goal without risking unnecessary damage:\n1. Move left to `(9, 9)` \u2014 this allows closer access to the goal, which can then be targeted in subsequent moves.\n\nThus, I will perform the **LEFT** action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis move should help in progressing towards the goal while keeping health intact.

Given the position and looking for a strategy regarding nearby resources ('$', which is at (7, 7), etc.), it ultimately emphasizes immediate action for maneuver.\n\nTherefore, moving to the left towards course action will be a follow-up for a rotational stance towards the next possible interaction without igniting unnecessary fire interactions or direct hazards.\n\n### Expected Action\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action is taken to explore the left direction first, intending to get closer towards possible maneuvering towards the goal while confirming that the risks from the left may invoke spontaneous fire or obstacles to manipulate or demolish accordingly based on the strategy described."
