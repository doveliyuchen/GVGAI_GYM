The closest satellite is at (0, 5), which is quite far vertically, but _immediate shooting isn't possible_ directly up.\n  \n- **Resource Management Opportunities**: There are supply sprites that you can collect (bullet supplies at (4, 14) and others).\n\n### Recommended Action\nGiven the hints about potential rotations and movement mechanics, the best initial action that may change your position (and is aligned with the strategy to avoid harm while managing resources or generating opportunities to eliminate satellites) is to move downward to (10, 1) (the next row down).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis downward action is expected to position you closer in the next turn to engage with nearby supply or strategy while keeping in safe movement until more cannot be found."
