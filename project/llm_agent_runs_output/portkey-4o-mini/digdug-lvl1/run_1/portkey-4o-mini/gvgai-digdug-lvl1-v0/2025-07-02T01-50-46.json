Instead, I can explore downwards to (row=15, col=5) or upwards toward the shovel at (row=13, col=6).\n\nSince my movement will not lead me closer to any immediate collectible or advantageous sprites, I'll opt to pick up the shovel to help manage any nearby threats.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action moves me up and the expectation is to grab the shovel which could be used to interact with the environment or defeat monsters later."
