This means the avatar can't move to the right right now.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Moves down to (12, 8), but that space is blocked by a wall.\n4. **ACTION_UP (4)**: Moves up to (10, 8), which is also on the floor.\n\n### Best Strategic Move\n- I need to prioritize the exit which is located to the right. Since I cannot move directly to the right due to the wall, I cannot progress towards the exit. \n- My next action could either be to move left or up; however, moving left does not help reach the exit any faster. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe best course of action is to move up first because that opens up pathways either left or back down.
