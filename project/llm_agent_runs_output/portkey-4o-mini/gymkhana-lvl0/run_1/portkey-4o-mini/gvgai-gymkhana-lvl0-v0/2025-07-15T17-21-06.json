There are water tiles (.) surrounding your avatar at (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 1), and more below.\n3. The goal (g) is located all around in the upper rows, but particularly accessible at (14, 7).\n\nGiven these observations, my strategy would be to carefully navigate around the water. Since the previous action may need to be adjusted after checking movement mechanics (the avatar's position didn't change), it's essential to decide the next valid action.\n\nI will proceed with the action to **move RIGHT** to (1, 2) since it's the most beneficial movement option:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis allows the avatar to potentially maneuver towards logs or other paths that might help avoid hazards and reach the goal. My expectation is that this keeps me safe from water for now while also progressing towards the goal."
