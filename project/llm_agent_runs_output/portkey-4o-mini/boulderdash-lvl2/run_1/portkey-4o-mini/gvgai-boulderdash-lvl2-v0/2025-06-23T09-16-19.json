Given that the avatar's current position is (11, 20), I can evaluate possible actions.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **Up (11, 20) to (10, 20):** This is a dirt space.\n2. **Down (11, 20) to (12, 20):** This is a wall.\n3. **Left (11, 20) to (11, 19):** This is empty.\n4. **Right (11, 20) to (11, 21):** This is empty.\n\n### Selected Action:\nMoving left to (11, 19) is a reasonable choice to explore an empty space while keeping close to the diamond collecting path.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action will allow me to explore further while assessing the area with potential diamond locations nearby.

I have noted that there's a risk of heading straight to the exit and losing if I don't have enough diamonds.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to **move left** to position (11, 18) first and evaluate surrounding diamonds, which might be optimal for my diamond collection before heading back to the exit if I've reached the collecting requirement.\n\nI'll proceed with the following action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nMoving left will potentially allow me to assess the situation better for further actions and diamond collection."

We need to collect at least 9 diamonds to successfully interact with the exit door.\n\n### Considerations:\n1. The player needs diamonds, and according to the map:\n   - There are diamonds at (2, 2), (2, 11), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), (7, 19), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 14), (9, 15), (9, 19), etc.\n2. The player's current diamond collection status was not mentioned, so assuming they have less than 9 currently, I must prioritize collecting diamonds.\n3. Nearby combat threats include crabs and butterflies which can damage the health count if engaged.\n\nWith the avatar at (11, 18), I can either:\n- Move left to try and collect diamonds in previous rows or significance.\n- Move directly to the exit, considering if we meet the criteria.\n\nSince the exit door is just two spaces away at (11, 20) and for now, we should focus on going to the left (11, 17) to assess if we can collect any diamonds in the next turn or engage in obstacles.\n\n### Action:\nLet's move left to (11, 17) to explore potential routes and assess risks.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action will allow me to see if there are better options available for collecting diamonds in the next move. If we're close enough, I may rather engage or preemptively gather resources while keeping the exit, checking potential diamond counts effectively."
