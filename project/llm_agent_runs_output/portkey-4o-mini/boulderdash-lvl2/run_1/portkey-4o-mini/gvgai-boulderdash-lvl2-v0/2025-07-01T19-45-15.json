You currently have little information about how many diamonds you have collected, but it is wise to secure more.\n\n3. **Enemy Awareness**: There are no immediate threats next to the avatar based on the surroundings, so it's safe to explore.\n\n4. **Action Planning**: Given the layout, I recommend moving left to collect the diamond positioned to the west (row 3, col 19) since it enhances the collection of valuable resources.\n\nBased on these observations, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to collect a diamond, increasing resource count and moving closer to a threshold necessary to unlock the exit later. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy of efficient resource management."
