The goal `(8, 26)`, represented as `#`, is quite distant but reachable through movement.\n\n### Strategy\nSince there are no obstacles in the immediate vicinity and to ensure that the avatar can proceed towards the goal effectively, we can move the avatar to the right towards the goal by selecting the action `ACTION_RIGHT`.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right is the best action as it brings the avatar closer to the goal while ensuring safety. I expect to see the avatar's position change to `(8, 3)` after this move."

I expect to continue progressing towards (8,26) without interruption."

Move either left (2), right (3), up (5), or down (4) involves checking surroundings. \n2. To progress towards the goal, moving **right** towards (column 4) seems the only strategic option at this moment since the goal is to the right and the path looks clear.\n\nGiven the available mechanics and layout, I will take the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nBy selecting this action, I expect the avatar to move into an open space, which will get closer to the goal without encountering any immediate threats."
