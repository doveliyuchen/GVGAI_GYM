Check potential movements up (to collect mana) or sideways (left or right).\n2. Since the avatar can only shoot bullets and utilize mana strategically when positioned correctly, considering upward movement to potentially align with the goal may be appropriate.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven the context and the surrounding spaces, I will choose to move **up** since it's the primary direction towards the goal and there are no immediate threats from fire:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nThis action is expected to help in aligning my avatar towards the goal direction and may provide a chance to collect mana if present above."

To reach it, I need to navigate through the level carefully.\n\nTo begin with, since I am at (9, 5) and my previous action did not change my position, I should explore a direction towards either collecting mana or reaching closer to the goal while avoiding fire hazards.\n\nFrom the current position, I have these possible actions:\n- Up (to row=8, col=5): unsafe as it has an empty block.\n- Down (to row=10, col=5): blocked.\n- Left (to row=9, col=4): unsafe since there\u2019s an @ box.\n- Right (to row=9, col=6): has an @ box.\n\nI can identify that moving up could put me in proximity to potential mana at (8, 2) but will keep me near fire in (8, 10), hence it's not ideal. However, moving right leads to more barriers (boxes).\n\nThe best option given the objective of maneuvering without loss of health and maximizing resource collection would be to move **up** towards (8, 5). \n\nThus, I will perform the action: \n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\nThis movement towards (8, 5) allows for the next exploration toward right after assessing fire patterns."
