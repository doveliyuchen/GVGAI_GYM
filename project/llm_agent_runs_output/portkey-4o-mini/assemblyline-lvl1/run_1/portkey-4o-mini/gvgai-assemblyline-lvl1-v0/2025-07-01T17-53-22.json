However, immediate movement will depend on the obstacles such as walls ('w').\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven that I'm currently positioned at (12, 4), I can move down to the next row at (13, 4), which is blocked by a wall, or I can go left to (12, 3) or right (12, 5), both of which are empty spaces ('.'). However, moving left (12, 3) or right (12, 5) will likely not lead to any immediate transformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAs I cannot move either left or down productively without hitting walls or encountering non-potato sprites, moving up to (11, 4) will bring me closer to the numerous potatoes available on rows above me.\n\nThus, the next action I will take is to move up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action aims to position myself closer to the collection of potatoes to start the transformation process towards the goal.
