Assess available resources and reach the key if possible. The key appears to be located at (2, 20), but it may require navigating around obstacles and potential deaths.\n2. The shovel, which can be used for points, is less critical than reaching the exit safely.\n\n### Available Moves\n- **Left (5, 6)**: A dollar sign ($, death ground), which does not yield immediate benefits.\n- **Right (5, 8)**: A dollar sign ($, death ground) also risky.\n- **Down (6, 7)**: An empty space (d), which allows further movement next turn.\n- **Up (4, 7)**: Encountering a box (@) and no immediate death threat but locked.\n\nI believe moving **down (to 6, 7)** is a safer choice as it opens further potential paths while avoiding immediate risks associated with interacting with boxes or death consequences directly. \n\nTherefore, I'll perform the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis move keeps my avatar safe and allows further planning to reach the key or potentially access the exit later."
