The main goal is to navigate towards the goal sprite (g) which is located at (0, 11).\n\n### Current Observations:\n- There is sand (x) available to the left at (7, 12) and right at (7, 14).\n- Moving down (8, 13) leads to more sand (x) but also potentially exposes the avatar to whirlpools below.\n- The avatar should avoid the whirlpools since they can be fatal.\n- The treasure at (8, 3) is also a target for collection as it contributes to the score.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe priority is to ensure the avatar collects resources while also making a strategic approach to reach the goal. \n\n1. **Immediate Objective**: From the current position (7, 13), moving left (to (7, 12)) seems viable since it leads to sand which can be collected but also does not put the avatar in harm's way.\n2. After ensuring movement to land, the next step could be to explore paths towards the goal (g) and ultimately collect any treasures encountered along the way.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will take the action of moving left to (7, 12).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action should allow the avatar to interact with sand while repositioning strategically for future moves towards the goal and treasure."

Move **down** towards the treasure at (8, 3) to collect it, as this adds valuable points (scoreChange=100) to your overall score. Collecting treasures is crucial for maximizing your score while progressing.\n\n### Action Selection\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves your avatar downwards to (8, 13). I expect to see the treasure 't' collected, which improves my score and keeps me on track towards succeeding in the level."
