    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar ('a') is positioned at (10, 14). The green goal ('#') is located at (1, 3), while there are several bomb turrets (represented by '@' and '$') present nearby that will shoot bombs, posing a hazard.\n\nSince your current position is stationary (you haven\u2019t moved from the last state), we should analyze the potential next move and the actions available to us that can help us avoid hazards while progressing toward the goal.\n\n### Current Position:\n- **Avatar Location:** (10, 14)\n- **Nearest Wall Obstructions:** \n  - A wall ('%') is directly above (at (9, 14)).\n  - A wall ('%') is directly below (at (11, 14)).\n  \n### Available Move Directions:\n- **UP (to (9, 14)):** But above you is a wall.\n- **DOWN (to (11, 14)):** But below you is also a wall.\n- **LEFT (to (10, 13)):** This is free space.\n- **RIGHT (to (10, 15)):** This is also free space.\n\nHowever, since the turrets at (5, 17) and (6, 3) shoot at intervals, we need to manage our position relative to the turrets' firing arcs. Since moving up or down is not possible due to walls, I will choose one of the lateral movements.\n\nI will perform the **LEFT** action to move to (10, 13), opening more opportunities for maneuvering in future turns. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action allows me to keep moving left while avoiding immediate hazards, aligning with the strategy of avoiding damage and incrementally approaching the goal."
