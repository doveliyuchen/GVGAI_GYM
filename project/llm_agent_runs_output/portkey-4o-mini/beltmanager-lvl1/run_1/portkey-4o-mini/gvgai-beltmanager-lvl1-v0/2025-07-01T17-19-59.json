There are several interactive elements and obstacles surrounding the avatar, including walls (`p`), levers (`*`, `d`, `&`, `b`), death (`%`), and some passengers (`l`). \n\n### Next Steps\nGiven that the avatar has the potential to interact with the world around it (i.e., moving left, right, up, or down), we need to inspect our surroundings:\n\n- **Current Position**: `(8, 2)` which has the levers nearby.\n- **Left** `(8, 1)`: `*` (lever left)\n- **Right** `(8, 3)`: `b` (lever right)\n- **Down** `(9, 2)`: `&` (lever down)\n- **Up** `(7, 2)`: `d` (lever up)\n\nWe can take action on one of these levers. Based on the strategy given, activating a lever can provide new pathways or manipulate the environment favorably for collecting passengers.\n\n### Decision\nIt might be wise to first interact with the lever on the left `(8, 1)` to observe how it transforms the environment.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect that manipulating this lever will yield new pathways or unlock obstacles leading towards the collection of passengers while being cautious about the suitcase movement."

The next logical step is to move to the right towards the joint (`'b'`), which could open up potential new pathways.\n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action directs the avatar to move right towards the joint.
