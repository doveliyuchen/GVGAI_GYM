The primary goal is to reach the green door located at (1, 9). \n\nThe immediate path to the goal seems to be blocked by obstacles (walls) above and requires navigating either to the left or right to create a path. There are also boxes '@' nearby which can potentially be used to clear a path if we utilize bombs. \n\nHowever, since the current position does not allow for any direct movement toward the exit based on the surrounding rows, and considering the layout includes walls, I need to initially focus on checking the interaction possible with nearest items.\n\nSince there are no immediate actions to trigger moving upwards (due to walls at (0,9) and (1,9)), the most rational decision now is to explore potential movements that could lead to a path, while also avoiding standing still. \n\nI'll choose to move to the left to (9, 8) which may give a better view of what options are next. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is intended to reposition the avatar, potentially to open up new strategy routes while maintaining a forward momentum towards the goal."

The map contains various boxes ('@') and a sizable amount of empty ground (',') and water ('.'), with walls ('$') surrounding the level's edges.\n\nThe key strategies include careful navigation to avoid hazards (like water, which would result in immediate failure) and the effective use of bombs to manipulate the environment and clear pathways toward the goal.\n\nGiven that the avatar is currently at (9, 9), I need to decide on the next action. I cannot remain in place because the action must change with each turn to progress. For the immediate next action, let's move upwards (to (8, 9)) as it begins to clear a path toward the goal (1, 9).\n\n``` Action:5 ``` \n\nBy moving upwards, I will be making progress towards reaching the goal while ensuring the avatar doesn't remain in the same position. This aligns with the strategy of planning movements towards the goal."
