The nearest goal is at (1, 9), which is several rows above.\n\n### Current Assessment:\n- There are various obstacles and sprite types between the avatar and the goal, but the path appears to be mostly clear, particularly through the water tiles which do not pose a direct threat to your health, as the closest hazards (fire and walls) are above you.\n- The immediate area around you (row 9) has boxes ('@') and empty spaces ('.'), and the goal is positioned where there are empty spaces around it (row 1).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Start by moving upwards towards the goal while staying clear of hazards.\n2. Since the avatar may need to rotate when turning directions, focus on the upward movement to progress towards the goal.\n\n### Next Action:\nI will attempt to move UP from (9, 9) to (8, 9). \n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis move is expected to bring you closer to the goal directly without encountering immediate hazards."
