The immediate action is to determine if the first move left reaches the goal directly or if further actions are required.\n\nBy moving left to (1, 2):\n- You'll land on a hole, which means the boulder can be directed to fall into that hole, thus clearing a path.\n\nHowever, your next target is the goal located further left. The current block at (1, 2) is a hole, which doesn't impede your movement but will remove the boulder above it if acted upon.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the action to take is to move left to (1, 2) first.
