Therefore, moving directly up from (4, 4) to (3, 4) seems like a reasonable step, maintaining proximity to our target path to goal. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the selected action is to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up appears aligned with our strategic goal of heading toward the goal directly while avoiding unnecessary risk.

However, (1, 2) is a hole, so that's not a viable move. The best option given the adjacency to the goal at (1, 1) is to move **LEFT** towards (2, 1), which would then allow the next move to be to (1, 1), the goal.\n\nGiven that moving **UP** into the hole is a clear loss condition, the only positive action would be to move **LEFT**.\n\n### Next Move\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will move the avatar towards (2, 1), providing a safer route towards the goal in the next step. I expect that this aligns well with the strategy of carefully planning movements to avoid hazards while progressing towards the goal."

However, moving down will lead to a boulder which could create a longer detour to get back to safety.
