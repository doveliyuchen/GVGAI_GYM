Our avatar currently faces obstacles to the left and right, with the opportunity to interact by moving down or left towards the potatoes directly adjacent.\n\nLooking at the immediate map layout and available actions, the best move is to **ACTION_USE** (action 1) to interact with the 'potato' located at (row 11, col 21) that is directly below in column 21. This can help with potential scoring and transformations.\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\nThis action allows us to initiate interaction with a potato, aiming to transform it and move towards the win condition while following the strategic suggestions. I expect to see a transformation and potentially increase the score."

Actions that could be considered:\n   - Moving upwards or left would not be advantageous, as they do not bring me closer to the potato or the goal.\n   - Moving right seems ideal as I would reach the potato.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most logical action is to move right to interact with the potato.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move allows me to collect the potato, putting me closer to achieving a transformation and ultimately the win condition.
