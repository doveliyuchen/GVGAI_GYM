    "content": "Given the current state, my avatar is positioned at (8, 1). There is a fast chicken located at (1, 23), but it is quite a distance away from my current position. There are various eggs located nearby at (5, 18), (5, 19), (6, 18), (6, 19), and other empty spaces, suggesting I can collect resources more safely for the time being.\n\nSince I need to gather explosive eggs to deal with the chicken, the best action at this moment is to move toward the area where the eggs are located. \n\nI will move to the right first (8, 2) to position myself towards the resource collection area.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \nMoving right will help me approach the eggs and prepare for future encounters with chickens while also following the established strategy of resource management."
