In the context of improving the situation to engage more effectively, moving towards the left (to (10, -1)) may help position the avatar for a better angle of attack, considering that the aliens are primarily positioned in the rows above.\n\nWith the rules indicating that the first directional action may just rotate if the position does not change, I will take a directional step to the left, which may provide a better vantage point or may need repeating if rotation occurs without actual movement.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\n**Feedback:** The action is aimed at moving the avatar left to seek better engagement with the aliens.
