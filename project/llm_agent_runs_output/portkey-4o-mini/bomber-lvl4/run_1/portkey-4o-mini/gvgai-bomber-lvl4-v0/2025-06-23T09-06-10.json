Since the goal is substantially above, it may be best to move left towards additional pathways or options.\n\n### Action Decision:\n1. There is no upward or downward movement possible.\n2.

Moving right could also be an option but is unlikely to lead directly closer to the goal.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best action to take is:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left will allow me to explore more possibilities and find a path that might lead towards the goal."
