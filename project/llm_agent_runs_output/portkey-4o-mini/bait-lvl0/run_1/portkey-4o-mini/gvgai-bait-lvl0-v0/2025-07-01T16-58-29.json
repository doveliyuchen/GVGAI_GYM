The next step is to move up to (1, 1), which is the goal.\n\nLet's proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action should allow the avatar to move upward towards the goal and secure a win, aligning with the strategy of reaching the goal after collecting the key."

My current action should be to move to the left (position (1, 1)) to reach the goal.\n\n### Action Decision\nI will perform the action to move left:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should successfully take my avatar to the goal sprite and thus achieve the win condition. I expect to see my avatar collect the goal sprite and win the game."
