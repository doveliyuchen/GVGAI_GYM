The goal at (1, 1) also cannot be reached without first obtaining a key, as the avatar is in the 'nokey' state. \n\n### Strategy Execution:\n\nBased on the earlier strategy suggestions, the first objective is to explore the surroundings. The nearest interactable object is the box located at (4, 3), which I can move towards as it may help navigate the environment. The next action must ensure that the avatar can move closer to potential objects that could lead to interacting with the key.\n\nI will move the avatar left to explore the overlap of available movements since the immediate obstacle to the left is clear. \n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action moves left into the empty space at (3, 1), where I can scout further options and plan the next move accordingly."

However, I can move further down or left/right; although, without the key, I cannot reach the goal yet. My best options are to investigate towards the sides or downwards to find the key or gather more information.\n\nTo proceed, I will perform the action `ACTION_LEFT` which is to move to (3, 1).
