I should explore options in other directions other than right to navigate safely toward the goal.\n2. Since moving right is not an option, I need to consider moving left or down to find a valid path.\n\n### Available Actions\n- **LEFT (Action 1)**: Would move me to (5, 10), but all the avenues continue to lead toward the goal.\n- **RIGHT (Action 2)**: Not a viable move due to the hole.\n- **DOWN (Action 3)**: Moves me to (6, 11) which is clear and opens new possibilities.\n- **UP (Action 4)**: (4, 11) is also clear but does not progress toward the goal effectively.\n\nGiven the absence of immediate pathways right and considering both the left and down options, **moving down** allows me to open a new row that may lead to further movements toward the right column without running into hazards immediately.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nBy choosing to **move down**, I can potentially find new paths in future moves that will help me avoid the hole and continue toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move will help assess the terrain below while avoiding hazards and trying to find a path to continue toward the goal safely."
