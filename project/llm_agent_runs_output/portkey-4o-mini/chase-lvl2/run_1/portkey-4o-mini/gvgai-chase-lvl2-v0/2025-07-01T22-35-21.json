The goal is to eliminate all scared sprites without the avatar being killed. The closest approached scared sprite is at (1, 21), which is a clear target if you can maneuver down first. However, I also need to consider the wall blockages and the interactions each time.\n\n### Available Actions for This Turn\n1. **Moving Up (ACTION_UP)** to (8, 16) will not be useful as it brings the avatar to an empty space.\n2. **Moving Down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (10, 16) will also lead to an empty space.\n3. **Moving Left (ACTION_LEFT)** to (9, 15) is possible, but this might lead into more surrounding walls next turn.\n4. **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (9, 17) allows movement into open space which may provide some additional strategic options.\n\n### Chosen Action\nConsidering the strategy, the best way to maneuver is to explore open areas and engage with scared sprites. Thus, I will:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving to the right seems to maintain flexibility and avoid walls directly. This action is expected to create an opportunity to react to upcoming scenarios in open space, contributing to a strategy towards victory by potentially clearing out scared sprites efficiently."

However, since I'm considering whether to rotate:\n1. **Moving Left (as primary action)**: Would only slightly change my area of operation with respect to the maze and doesn't lead to immediate threats or advantages.\n2. **Moving Right (as primary action)**: This would position the avatar into a section that may have more empty spaces or options as it is wider toward the edge of the maze.\n\nGiven this, moving **right** appears more advantageous as it may open wider routes in upcoming turns.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will potentially open more paths for my next moves, aligning with the strategy of exploring opportunities while keeping my avatar safe from threats."

The avatar needs to traverse through empty spaces ('.') to position itself strategically for interactions with the scared sprites.\n3. Since the primary objective is to eliminate the scared sprites around while also avoiding the danger from any chasing sprites, taking a horizontal step to the left or right is a wise decision to get closer to the scared sprites.\n\nCurrently, the avatar can move to the left (8, 12) or to the right (8, 14). However, moving right does not lead closer to any scared sprites directly. Moving left does.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will take the action of moving left:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis should move the avatar closer to the scared sprites, allowing for potential interactions in the following turns.

The immediate goal is to find a path towards scared sprites while considering the possible movements.\n\n### Decision-Making\nSince the avatar is positioned at (8, 11), let's evaluate possible moves:\n\n- **Up (7, 11)**: This cell is empty (.), meaning the avatar can move up.\n- **Down (9, 11)**: This cell is also empty (.).\n- **Left (8, 10)**: This cell is empty (.).\n- **Right (8, 12)**: This cell is also empty (.).\n\nEach of these directions doesn\u2019t currently lead directly to a scared sprite, but moving into the area where the scared sprites are located (above at row 1) is vital.\n\n**Next Move**: Moving up (to (7, 11)) seems logical as it keeps the avatar somewhat closer to the row containing the scared sprites while also keeping it flexible for subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nFeedback: I chose to move up to position (7, 11) to maintain close proximity to the scared sprites while ensuring the avatar stays safe. I expect this move to allow for future opportunities to engage with the nearby scared sprites."

The avatar can interact with scared sprites and carcasses to prefer transforming scared sprites into carcasses. \n\n### Strategies for Current State:\n1. **Approach Scared Sprites**: The closest scared sprite is at (1, 1) which is 8 steps away from the avatar. \n2. **Use Carcass**: There are carcasses available at (1, 17) and (1, 18) that can potentially be used to eliminate scared sprites around them.\n\n### Potential Actions\n1. Moving directly towards a scared sprite to eliminate it.\n2. Moving towards a carcass to strategically set up for removing scared sprites in the next turn.\n\nSince the avatar is currently at (9, 18) and moving up (to row 8) is an unobstructed option, this is the best preliminary move towards engaging with the sprites:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n### Feedback\nThis action aims to move up towards row 8, which is clear, allowing for further options in subsequent turns while inching closer to the scared sprites above."
