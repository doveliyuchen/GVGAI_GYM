The direct path to the exit is obstructed by walls and traps. \n2. You will need to find a safe route through the open areas marked by `.` that do not lead to traps.\n3. The most urgent task is to move strategically considering the traps around.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **Move Left (to 8, 6)**: This area is safe.\n2. **Move Right (to 8, 8)**: This area is also safe.\n3. **Move Up (to 7, 7)**: This area is also safe but does not noticeably bring you closer to your goal.\n4. **Move Down (to 9, 7)**: This is also a safe area.\n\nConsidering these strategies:\n\n- The safest course of action is to move towards the exit while navigating through open spaces. From the current position of your avatar (8, 7), moving **Left** to (8, 6) allows further flexibility to explore the next moves towards the exit.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left should provide some distance to evaluate another movement toward the exit while keeping exposed traps at bay.
