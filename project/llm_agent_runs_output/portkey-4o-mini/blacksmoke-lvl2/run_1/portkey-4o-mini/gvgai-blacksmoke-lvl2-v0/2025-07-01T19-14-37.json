This action is not permitted as there\u2019s a wall.\n\nGiven all the options, the only valid action that does not lead to immediate death or an obstruction is to move left into the box. However, we currently lack a shovel to manipulate the box, so this action will not yield immediate progress.\n\n### Next Step:\nSince moving left into the box does not yield fruitful options and other directions are blocked or lead to instant death, we should **analyze the state** more carefully or repeat the decision to maximize movement safely. We do not want to repeat a position that doesn\u2019t lead to progress.\n\nSince the action result from the previous move puts us in a dead position where actions lead to either a wall or death, we will need to focus on the strategy of moving left into the box.\n\nExpecting that this leads us to further investigate how to interact with boxes in subsequent moves. Continuing to hold our position here is insufficient; thus I should break from the previous incorrect assumptions and move the one available left.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action intends to progress us towards using the box in future strategy; keeping in mind we'll need to collect a shovel eventually to manipulate the boxes."

There is no obstacle below (4, 5 is also 'd'), and above (2, 5 is '$').\n- The exit is located at (11, 1). This means you need to navigate all the way down while staying cautious of walls and hazards.\n\nTo proceed in the game effectively and given that the avatar's position does not change with the last action, we will have to first evaluate making a movement.\n\nAn optimal action is to move right to (3, 6) to get closer to clear pathways and avoid being stuck against walls.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis choice is aligned with the strategy of evaluating terrain and ensuring you can access valuable paths to progress toward the exit while avoiding hazards."

The exit is located at (11, 1), and I need to find the optimal route towards it.\n2. I can consider movements in the left, right, up, and down directions to navigate towards the exit while ensuring I'm not blocked by walls.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n- **UP (6, 3)**: This leads to an empty spot, which may provide new possibilities.\n- **DOWN (8, 3)**: This leads to an empty spot but further investigation will be needed in the next moves.\n- **LEFT (7, 2)**: This leads to a box '@', but it may not be beneficial to move into it directly.\n- **RIGHT (7, 4)**: This leads to an empty spot and may offer a better route.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, I will move **DOWN to (8, 3)** first as it opens up possibilities for further moves toward the exit while avoiding obstacles.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move opens potential further pathways toward the exit while keeping options flexible, adhering to the strategy of evaluating terrain and moving efficiently."
