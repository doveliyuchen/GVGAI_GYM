    "content": "Given the current state, your avatar (denoted as 'a') is located at (1, 5), and you're adjacent to the ingredient represented by '$' at (1, 4). Additionally, there are chefs (denoted by '@') positioned close to the avatar, specifically at (1, 6) and (1, 7).\n\n### Evaluation and Strategy\n- **Ingredient Collection:** You need to collect the ingredients in a specific order: flour, milk, egg, sugar, butter, and cherries.\n- **Current Position:** You are currently well-positioned to collect the sugar at (1, 4) but need to ensure you do it without coming into contact with the chef.\n- **Chef Movement:** The chefs are very close (at (1, 6) and (1, 7)), meaning moving directly left to collect the sugar could result in an immediate collision, leading to a score penalty.\n\n### Planned Action\nTo effectively collect the sugar while avoiding the chef, the best initial action is to **move up to change position** as moving left to collect the sugar is too risky due to the immediate proximity of the chefs.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\n### Feedback Expectation\nThis action should ideally place the avatar in a safer position without risking contact with the chefs, allowing for a subsequent strategy to collect the sugar when it's safe to do so."

The immediate available options are to move in the direction of the ingredient that can be collected next, which is milk '$' located at (1, 4).\n\nThe chef '@' is positioned at (1, 6) and (1, 7), indicating movements towards the player should be calculated carefully to avoid score penalties. \n\nTo proceed, the player will move LEFT to (1, 4), where the milk is located. Collecting the milk will lead to a score increase, and since the chef is already adjacent, it will also position the player securely for subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should allow the avatar to collect milk and avoid the chef momentarily. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy of collecting ingredients swiftly and managing the chef's movements."
