The exit is located at (1,3), along with various box and switch mechanics around the avatar's potential starting position.\n\n### Current Map Overview:\n- The avatar can interact with the blue switch at (2,2) and the red switch at (1,10). \n- The exit at (1,3) is accessible directly if conditions allow.\n- There are several \"g\" (red box) and \"1\" (normal box) in the vicinity which can impact movement based on the avatar's color change.\n\n### Recommended Action Strategy:\n1. If the avatar has not moved from its position since the last action, we need to think carefully about the next move.\n2. Since we could potentially start by interacting with the blue switch to access blue box mechanics, moving toward it could lead to a more strategic position to eventually reach the exit.\n\n### Next Steps:\nAssuming the avatar is in the vicinity of the blue switch at (2,2), we will want to take action to interact with it to set up for reaching the exit.\n\nI'll initiate an action towards the blue switch located at (2,2).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aims to verify if the avatar can interact with the blue switch and change its color effectively to engage in useful box mechanics to progress toward the exit. The expectation is that engaging with the blue switch will indeed transform the avatar to utilize blue boxes on subsequent moves."

Switches located at (2, 2) and (4, 4) can possibly facilitate color changes to interact with various boxes effectively.\n\n### Current Actions and Strategy:\nWe need to determine an action that would either allow us to move towards the exit or interact with a switch to prepare for future movements.\n\nSince the avatar can't move from its current position (we'll assume it hasn't been set distinctly), we should probably engage with either a switch or make an appropriate move that leads directly towards the exit or interactable objects.\n\nGiven that the expected point of rotation could lead us to a new choice, if the current position isn't explicitly stated, I will select a downward movement (Action DOWN, which is 3) assuming it interacts with row 2 where there is a switch, to engage with that ultimately.\n\nThus, I will choose:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving downwards is expected to get closer to the switch at (2,2) enhancing our interaction options and situating us nearer to useful resources, ensuring we maneuver toward the exit effectively."

The avatar's position in the game is crucial for determining the next action.\n\nFrom the current mapping:\n\n- The avatar appears to be of red color (as it is surrounded by 'g' which is red box).\n- Notably, the exit (indicated by '$') is located at position (1,3).\n- Several obstacles such as holes ('*') are evident in the grid, and there are also colored boxes and switches that will impact the avatar's actions.\n\nGiven the initial action rules and the game mechanics, assessing our immediate surroundings shows that we have:\n\n1. A hole immediately below (2,3), thus moving downward would result in failure.\n2. Other possible actions (left, right, or up) should be evaluated.\n\nCurrently, from interpreting the game design and layout, the best course of action is to move upward since it keeps away from hazards, and accessing the colored switches could be a strategic move towards the exit.\n\nTherefore, following this analysis:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up is a prudent choice to navigate close to the exit while avoiding potential pitfalls."

Here's a summary of relevant observations:\n\n1. **Avatar Type and Position**: The type of the avatar (normal, red, blue, green) appears to be crucial in this puzzle platformer, particularly regarding interactions with boxes and switches.\n  \n2. **Current Map Layout**: Our avatar below is neither at the exit nor interacting with a box or switch currently. We need to assess viable paths to take towards reaching the exit while avoiding hazards.\n\n3. **Exit Position**: The exit is located at (1, 3) on the grid. The avatar likely needs to traverse around walls and use the available paths to make it there.\n\n4. **Nearby Hazards**: The map layout shows multiple \"holes\" (*) scattered across rows that present immediate danger for movement, while the switching mechanics can help change the avatar's interaction capabilities.\n\n5. **Objective**: The goal is to find a route that leads to the exit, minimizing the risk of falling into holes or getting stuck.\n\nGiven the current configuration and rules of interaction, the next actionable idea is to move **RIGHT** to gain access to potential paths, or if further analysis shows it\u2019s not possible, consider orientation adjustment instead.\n\n### Next Action\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to help the avatar move closer to the right side of the map towards potential routes that may lead us to the exit, adhering to our strategy of careful path planning."

The best available action from (1,1) is to move **right** to (1,2), which keeps us on the same row as the exit. Although directly adjacent to a wall moving left is not feasible, moving down also keeps the distance to the exit manageable. \n\nSince moving right (1,2) allows for maneuvering towards the exit with further actions possible, and also avoids pitfalls and walls:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis move is optimal as it positions the avatar towards the exit path while navigating safely through the grid before the next moves can be planned."

The next immediate cells surrounding the avatar (1, 1) are:\n   - Up (0, 1): 'h' (hole)\n   - Down (2, 1): '.' (floor)\n   - Left (1, 0): 'h' (hole)\n   - Right (1, 2): '.' (floor)\n\n2.
