To achieve this, I need to determine the safest and most strategic movement direction. \n\n### Possible Actions\nThe last action recorded does not seem to have been shared; hence, I will assume the avatar could be facing either up, down, left, or right. Given that the avatar is currently at (6, 3), the available movement options\u2014keeping in mind the mechanics of potential rotation\u2014have to avoid walls.\n\nConsidering the mechanics where the avatar might rotate and not move with one directional action, I will select an action leading toward open routes that could potentially connect to more 'scared' sprites.\n\n### Decision\nThe following paths are available:\n- Moving left (to (6, 2)) is possible but may not lead closer to any important sprites.\n- Moving right (to (6, 4)) is also open.\n- Moving up (to (5, 3)) is also possible and continues open space in (5, 4) and further up.\n- Moving down (to (7, 3)) maintains distance from the edges, likely retaining multiple movement options in subsequent turns.\n\n#### Recommended Action:\nIt might be wise to move **up (ACTION_UP)** to evaluate the situation above and potentially increase safety and options for subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action seems to align with increasing movement space and possibly encountering more 'scared' sprites in the future.

There are several opportunities to manipulate more scared sprites and potentially avoid any danger from angry sprites:\n\n1. **Movement Opportunities**: The avatar can potentially move left (to (9, 12)), right (to (9, 14)), up (to (8, 13)), or down (to (10, 13)). \n   - Moving left (9, 12): This position is free, but it does not get closer to any scared birds.\n   - Moving right (9, 14): This position is also free, but again does not affect any immediate interaction with scared birds.\n   - Moving up (8, 13): This position is free, but similarly lacks immediate benefit.\n   - Moving down (10, 13): This position is on the wall row and thus isn't valid.\n\nAfter considering the options, I see that there are scared birds to the left at (1, 7), (1, 21), and further to the left and below at other rows. However, given the current layout and the fact that the avatar has not moved yet, the next actionable step should be to find a route that heads towards these scared birds. \n\nAmong the valid options, to optimize the interaction with the nearest scared bird, I can move left or focus on moving up. \n\n### Selected Action\nI will perform the following action:\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\n### Action Feedback\nThis chosen action will orient the avatar left. Moving left to (9, 12) makes it easier to navigate through the available pathways towards the birds in the next moves, allowing for pointing towards the direction of scared birds. My expectation is to avoid the walls and prepare to engage with more sprites as I come closer to them."
