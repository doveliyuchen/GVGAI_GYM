Both of these moves keep me safe from immediate enemy threats, but I aim to uncover more of the environment.\n\nI will choose to move **left to (6, 8)**.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to (6, 8) will allow me to explore more while avoiding potential threats from enemies direction. My expectation is to keep the avatar safe while uncovering possible resources or pathways."

I should prioritize resource collection.\n2. I noticed that there are keys and potential resources on the map, particularly keylike items on the depot space (row 1, col 4) at a higher elevation.\n3. Avoiding thugs and minimizing risks while maximizing my resource collection is essential.\n\nAs my avatar's position hasn't changed since the last state, I will make a movement decision aimed at resource collection:\n\nMoving **UP** (to row 5, col 8) will potentially allow for further exploration of the space without risk of immediate confrontation with enemies. \n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should help me reposition while maintaining safety and aligns with my goal to collect resources efficiently."
