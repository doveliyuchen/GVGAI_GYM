Moving up is possible but would not lead to immediate progress since the avatar cannot go down due to the wall below.\n\n### Strategy Review:\nFollowing the strategy guidelines:\n- **Plan Movement**: The avatar has the opportunity to explore by moving left or right. Both directions are valid as they consist of empty spaces.\n- **Closer to Goal**: The goal is to continue moving toward reaching the portal at (0, 19). Since the direct path upward or downward is blocked, I can utilize left or right navigation to eventually situate my avatar better for future moves.\n\nI will choose to move **right** to (row 12, col 13) to keep progressing.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right should enable my avatar to advance toward the goal while keeping options open for subsequent turns."

The surrounding tiles are mostly walls ('c'), boulders ('k'), and empty spaces ('.'). The key obstacles and interactions involve avoiding walls and managing the boulders.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n1. **Boulders Manipulation**: Since there are boulders near the avatar, we can potentially use them for strategic movement or to block cars if they come into play.\n2. **Avoiding Walls**: We need to select actions that prevent the avatar from being positioned against walls or into traps.\n3. **Movement Towards Target**: Overall, the aim is to guide the avatar to the goal while maneuvering around obstacles.\n\n### Determining Action:\nLooking at the available actions:\n- There are spots to the 'left' (1, 14 and 2, 14) and to 'right' (1, 16), but left has walls and thus will be blocked.\n- Moving 'down'(rows will increase) could allow for further movement toward the goal.\n\n#### Action Consideration:\nSince the avatar did not move in the previous turn, we need to enact an action that results in movement. The most appropriate immediate action would be to move down towards (13, 15).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move is intended to provide a change in position towards lower rows and ideally get closer to areas with potential to maneuver further towards reaching the goal."

Below is the analysis and decision based on the rules and mechanics.\n\n### State Analysis:\n- The immediate row from the avatar's position has walls ('c') on either side, with a box ('b') right next to the avatar to the left at (11, 18). \n- Below the avatar at (12, 19), we notice an empty space ('.'), and immediate movements overall might be limited until objects are manipulated.\n\n### Strategic Move Decision:\n1. The first action should be to interact with the box ('b'). \n2. Using the \"ACTION_USE\" allows us to either push or manipulate objects around the avatar since there are no immediate directional movements available that would result in a position change without altering the object.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nExecuting Action 1 (\"ACTION_USE\") will allow the avatar to manipulate the box, which could provide options for future moves.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThe action to use the box is aimed at creating new pathways or solving any nearby obstacles, thus leading toward reaching the portal more effectively in the next steps."

(open space)\n- **Right** (11, 17): '.' (open space)\n- **Up** (10, 16): 'w' (car, which would be a danger)\n- **Down** (12, 16): '.' (open space)\n\nContinuing the strategy outlined, an immediate goal is to move towards an unoccupied space to explore or engage with boulders and interact with the environment effectively. Moving up would lead to danger due to the presence of a car, so I will avoid that direction.\n\nI will opt to move **Left** to (11, 15).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis should get me closer to maximizing my options without encountering immediate hazards from the car above. I expect to assess the new position and plan further actions from there."
