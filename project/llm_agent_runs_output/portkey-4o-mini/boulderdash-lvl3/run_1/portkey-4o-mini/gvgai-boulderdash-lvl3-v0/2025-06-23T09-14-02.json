The avatar 'a' is located at (7, 7), surrounded by:\n   - Up (6, 7): Free space (.)\n   - Down (8, 7): Free space (.)\n   - Left (7, 6): Free space (.)\n   - Right (7, 8): Free space (.)\n\n2. The exit door '*' is located at (2, 6), which is several rows above the avatar, requiring vertical movement.\n\n3. Key collectibles are diamonds '%' scattered around the map. The nearest diamond is observed at:\n   - (3, 5): Diamond \n   - (3, 6): Diamond \n   - (4, 1): Diamond \n   - (5, 3): Diamond \n   - (5, 4): Diamond \n   - etc.\n\n### Strategy Implementation\nBased on the overall strategy of navigating wisely while collecting diamonds, a logical step is to explore or attempt to collect a nearby diamond. Given that you're positioned adjacent to a square with empty space and the goal is to eventually reach the exit, we'll want to either move up or collect a nearby resource.\n\nIt's important to ensure that action aligns with maximizing our chances of victory while keeping the movement forward.\n\nSince action to the left or right does not yield a collectible and we're effectively \"stuck\" momentarily in the center area with potential to either move up or seek down, I will choose to move **down** to (8, 7) to explore down further where there are more horizontal free spaces to navigate through, potentially yielding new opportunities.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action will explore lower positions and might help in discovering more opportunities for movement or collect diamonds in the subsequent turns; it aligns with seeking alternatives to reach the exit effectively."

The immediate surroundings include:\n   - Up (7, 7): Empty space (.)\n   - Down (9, 7): Empty space (.)\n   - Left (8, 6): Empty space (.)\n   - Right (8, 8): Empty space (.).\n\n2. **Resource Collection**: The nearby diamonds are at (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 6), and (5, 16). However, some movements are required to reach them without coming into proximity with the enemies, particularly below rows 9 and lower where I see crabs.\n\n3. **Strategy Alignment**:\n   - Since the avatar has not moved since the last state analysis, I will aim to reposition the avatar.\n   - Moving up seems the most logical step as it may provide greater options to collect more diamonds and avoid enemy crabs located in lower rows.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nBy moving up, I can explore opportunities for more strategic movements or collect resources effectively while also assessing enemy positions further.
