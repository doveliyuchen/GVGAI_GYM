Right above you in rows 9 and 8 are bombs represented by '&', and to your right on row 0, there are numerous aliens ('@') that are potentially threatening the base below.\n\nSince your avatar's position has not changed recently, I need to analyze the state of enemies and obstacles around before taking further actions. In the immediate next possible actions, I can consider moving left or right to avoid bombs, especially since there are explosive threats just above.\n\nTo ensure that you are safe and to improve your line of sight for attacking aliens, I will take the action to move my avatar to the right:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action is in line with the strategy of maintaining distance from the bombs while enabling you to attack the aliens from a safer position. By moving right, you may also have a clearer shot at shooting the enemies without being directly in the line of fire from bombs above."

The objective is to manage the defense of the base while maximizing the score by taking down the aliens. Since the player's avatar position has not changed, I will plan my actions accordingly.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. The current position of the avatar allows for visibility and attack on the aliens directly above (positions in row 0 and row 1, such as the aliens at (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), etc.).\n2. The strategy emphasizes maintaining distance while maximizing attack potential. \n\nI will take the following action to shoot at the aliens directly:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow me to attack the aliens nearby, which aligns with the strategy of maximizing score by defeating alien sprites. I expect to see reductions in the alien count in the next state."

In this situation, since the avatar has not moved recently and there are threats (aliens) directly above, the strategy should involve either attacking or moving to evade these threats.\n\nThe following actions could be considered:\n\n1. **Move Left (2)**: This keeps the avatar in its current row, potentially evading a collision with the incoming aliens.\n2. **Move Right (3)**: This similarly keeps the avatar in the same row but could help to reposition away from any direct threats.\n3. **Use (1)**: If the avatar has missiles available, attacking the nearest alien could help clear the threat.\n\nGiven the strategy of greater importance on movement for avoiding potential hits from incoming enemies, I will opt to move the avatar to the left.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should help create distance from the potentially dangerous aliens while keeping an option open to attack next turn if necessary."
