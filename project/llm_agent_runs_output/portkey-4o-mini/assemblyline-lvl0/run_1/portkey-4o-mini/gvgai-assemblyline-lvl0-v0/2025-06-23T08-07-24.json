Your avatar has several \"j\" (potato) tiles around it, which means that a transformation process can possibly occur. The goal (\"g\") is located at (12, 21), and in the vicinity of the avatar at the moment, there are several transformation opportunities to pursue. We have the following locations of significance:\n\n1. The potatoes are located at (1, 19), (2, 19), (3, 19), (4, 19), (5, 19), (6, 19), (7, 19), (8, 19), (9, 19), (10, 19), (11, 19), (12, 19).\n2. The goal is at (12, 21).\n\nGiven that we currently have potatoes available, we want to focus on starting the transformation, which reinforces the strategy of prioritizing transformations to achieve the potatofull state, as laid out in the game rules.\n\nIf we perform a directional action, we should focus on moving towards one of the potatoes for interaction. Since we are currently at the avatar location (11, 19) with only one move to the next potato at (12, 19), we will move the avatar down towards (12, 19) to start the transformation process.\n\nThe action to take would be:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nI'm expecting this action to be valuable towards reaching our goal of transforming potatoes as we move directly into a position with interaction opportunities."
