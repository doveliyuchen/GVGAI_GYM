The closest to the goal is at (12, 19), but there's also one at (4, 19) and (3, 19).\n\n**Key Mechanics to Consider**:\n- The avatar should collect and transform potatoes to meet the final goal.\n- Engaging with the walls ('b') or avoiding unnecessary backtracking is essential.\n- Vortex ('v') might be usable to navigate around more efficiently.\n\n### Strategy Considerations:\n- Since the avatar is likely positioned near potatoes (given the layout), I should focus on either collecting or transforming one of them into a finished product that can interact with the goal 'g'.\n- The quickest route to the goal is a priority, but encountering obstacles and transforming items properly must be factored in as well.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nI will investigate further to determine my avatar's exact position because the last recorded movement likely didn't result in a shift.

The `potato` (`j`) is scattered multiple times across the grid, notably at coordinates such as `(1, 19)`, `(2, 19)`, `(3, 19)`, `(4, 19)`, `(5, 19)`, `(6, 19)`, `(7, 19)`, `(8, 19)`, `(9, 19)`, `(10, 19)`, and `(11, 19)`.\n\nThe objective now is to reach that `potato` at `(1, 19)` for transformation. Since there is a `vortex` nearby at around `(5, 4)` or `(2, 19)`, and considering all the information, we need to navigate towards collecting the potato; thereby the immediate action should focus on either moving up or down based on positioning relative to other entities.\n\nTo either rotate or ensure movement towards the target - the `potato`, I\u2019ll take the action to move **down** from where the avatar's presumed starting location is. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should ideally lead the avatar down towards a `potato`, aligning with my objective of transformation while also considering the score increase that collecting this item provides."
