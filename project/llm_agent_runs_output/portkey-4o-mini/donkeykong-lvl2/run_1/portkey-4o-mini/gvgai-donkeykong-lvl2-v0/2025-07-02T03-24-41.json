The goal is located at (1, 10) and the player needs to navigate through the map while avoiding obstacles, such as walls (represented by '%') and the donkey (represented by '#') located at (2, 4).\n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar is at (10, 49) and (10, 50). This suggests that the player can either move left to (10, 48) or right to (10, 51) or down to (11, 49) or (11, 50).\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal is relatively far away, thus requiring strategic navigation.\n3. **Obstacles**: There are several walls nearby on row 10 that limit movement options. Strategically choosing movement directions is essential to avoid getting blocked.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nConsidering the avatar is at (10, 49) and (10, 50), both available actions will lead to rotation but not movement. The next actions need to be defined based on barrel interactions or movements that will allow reaching the goal. \n\nSince no meaningful movement option is visibly advantageous at the immediate position, and observing the layout is paramount, moving around obstacles with potential score from manipulation of barrels may be needed.\n\n### Selected Action:\nFor this turn, I will move **down** to (11, 49). This action allows for a new strategy observant of the next state if further pathways can be opened.\n\n```Action: 4``` \n\nThis move explores further options down which may assist in navigating around walls and obstacles while keeping the goal in sight."

The objective is to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles and effectively manipulating the barrels.\n\n### Current Analysis\n- The avatar's current position provides a few potential movements. The closest route toward the goal is moving up the grid.\n- Notably, the goal is quite far above the current position of the avatar, and there are obstacles (walls '%') in the way.\n- The barrels could be used strategically for creating paths, or altering the field by breaking them.\n\n### Movement Strategy\n1.

Sidebar: As hints suggest that if the position doesn't change, the avatar may need to rotate before moving, the analysis stays focused on using the upward movement first, as that provides direct access to navigate towards the goal.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven this movement analysis, the best action to take is to move up:\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis move is intended to allow the avatar to ascend towards the goal direction, focused on ensuring the path is leading to an eventual win condition.

There are no options to move up or down due to walls.\n2. The left move could be strategic because it allows interaction with the breakable barrel, which may influence either a score change or remove an obstacle depending on its interaction mechanics with the environment. \n3. Moving right to an empty space does not provide any tactical advantage in interacting with the barrel.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe best action is to move to the left to interact with the breakable barrel. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left to interact with the barrel could yield a strategic advantage, possibly clearing a path or scoring points, which aligns with the strategy of utilizing barrels as tools in navigating the environment effectively."

However, given that there are walls above, it may lead to a dead end.\n- **Moving Down (4)**: This action could potentially help check whether a path exists below to interact with barrels.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nIn order to navigate effectively, rolling or breaking barrels while avoiding dead ends must be prioritized. Given that the current position doesn't change from the last action, after analyzing the surroundings, moving down seems to be a valid choice, as it could allow for an exploration of lower rows, potentially revealing options with barrels or paths toward the goal.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis should allow assessing the lower row for more interaction items while maintaining a possible escape route towards the goal.

The goal sprite ('$') is positioned at row 1, column 10, which is quite far vertically and surrounded by walls and barrels that may pose obstacles.\n\nSince there are no immediate directions to move up towards the goal as the path is blocked, you need to assess your surroundings based on the layout provided. The available actions involve moving left, right, down, or up (with the latter being limited due to the walls). \n\nYour immediate strategy would be to explore the area around your avatar to find a way to improve your situation. Thus, moving to the right to possibly find a more open path looks like a good starting point.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nBy moving right, I expect to either encounter more paths to explore or perhaps strategically interact with barrels that could help in clearing the way towards the goal. This action aligns with my strategy of maximizing movement options."

To reach the goal, I need to navigate upward and potentially find ways to break or roll barrels to clear a path.\n\nFrom my current position, the immediate upward (ACTION_UP) movement does not show a straightforward path since there are walls above (row 9 and row 8 are also filled with wall sprites). However, moving left (ACTION_LEFT) might open up opportunities to evade some obstacles.\n\nGiven I just rotated to face left during my last move, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nFeedback: Moving left should help me find a better route to navigate upwards toward the goal, as staying in my current column is blocked. I expect to see if this approach provides a clearer pathway."

    "content": "Given the information about the current state of the game and the layout of the map, the player avatar's position is located at (10, 38), where it can interact with various barrels and navigate towards the goal sprite (located at (1, 10)).\n\nIn this state, the avatar has the following immediate considerations:\n\n1. There are several breakable barrels adjacent to the avatar that could be manipulated.\n2. The goal sprite is significantly far away, requiring the avatar to navigate through obstacles strategically.\n3. The presence of walls means that movement options may be limited based on the route chosen.\n\nTo make progress towards the goal, I will analyze the possible actions:\n\n- Moving **UP** to (9, 38), there are only walls (no other blocks) that might obstruct further movement.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (11, 38) is feasible and opens up further options.\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** would require checking for walls and other obstacles.\n\nSince the player has not moved since the last state, we should consider the next logical action that allows movement towards the goal while managing the environment around the avatar. The most advantageous move is probably **DOWN** to (11, 38), opening up options for future turns without immediate risk.\n\nThus, I choose the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nI expect this action to open up further movement options and avoid obstacles in the next turn, aligning with the strategic focus on reaching the goal."
