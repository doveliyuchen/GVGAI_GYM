The goal is to move towards the left, as the end goal is relatively positioned left from the current avatar position. \n2. I have analyzed obstacles and potential hazards from my current position to the goal, ensuring I avoid any that appear.\n\nI will now take the action to move **left** (toward the goal).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should bring the avatar closer to the goal while navigating around the hazards effectively.

However, there are several obstacles that could hinder the ascent.\n- **Hazards:** \n  - Directly above (row 7) there are trucks; during movement, the avatar must avoid these obstacles to remain alive.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nGiven the necessity to navigate past obstacles and the strategic requirement to move toward the goal while paying attention to the hazards, the avatar should first attempt an action to rotate, then assess safe paths to avoid trucks on the way up.\n\n#### Take Action:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThe chosen action is to move **UP** towards the goal. This aligns with the strategy to ascend towards row 1 where the goal is located, while being cautious of potential collisions with trucks as I move. I expect to see if the avatar can successfully proceed without encountering hazards directly."
