I would need to collect keys (&) located at (2, 8) and also navigate carefully around the hazards.\n\nGiven that my avatar's position does not change, I need to think strategically about my next move without rushing into hazards or dead ends. The best move I can make that adheres to the strategy of mapping a route to the exit while avoiding immediate hazards is to move left (to (7, 7)). This keeps options open without advancing toward the dangerous area.\n\nThus, I will proceed as follows:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left helps to reposition my avatar strategically while avoiding hazards toward the exit path."
