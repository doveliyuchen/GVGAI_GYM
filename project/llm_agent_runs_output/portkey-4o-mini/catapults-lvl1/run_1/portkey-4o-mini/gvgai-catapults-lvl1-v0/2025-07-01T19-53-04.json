The goal is to navigate towards the goal sprite, which is at (7, 7) and (11, 14) on the map. \n\nThere are several water tiles scattered throughout the map, with a heavy concentration of water represented by '.' below my current position. I must avoid these to prevent losing my avatar. \n\nGiven that my avatar can move left, right, up, or down, the immediate goal is to explore the position in a way that leads closer to either goal tile while ensuring I avoid obstacles like water.\n\nBased on the layout, I should consider moving somewhere that maintains distance from water and allows me to navigate towards the goals:\n- If I move **up (to (0,1))**, I will hit a wall (represented by '*').\n- If I move **down (to (2,1))**, I will land on water (an immediate loss).\n- If I move **left (to (1,0))**, I will hit a wall (also a loss).\n- If I move **right (to (1,2))**, it places me onto free space, which will allow further exploration.\n\nThus, the most strategic move would be to go **right**. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nThis action places me on a tile that provides more options for the next moves while keeping me away from immediate hazards and moving toward the goal vicinity."
