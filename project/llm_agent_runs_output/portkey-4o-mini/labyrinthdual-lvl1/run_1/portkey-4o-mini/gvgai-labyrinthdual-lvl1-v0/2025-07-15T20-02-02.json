The avatar is currently in row 6 and must move upwards (considering the exit's row position).\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The path involves moving through various rows with walls and traps. Notably, the avatar's current surroundings include the potential for wall contact and traps.\n\n### Potential Moves:\nSince the avatar\u2019s current position is (6, 8) and it must navigate towards (2, 1), let's evaluate a movement action:\n\n- **Moving Up (to 5, 8):** This step is valid since it is a clear path (the avatar will be on a normal wall).\n- **Future Moves:** Continuing this upward movement should allow the avatar to find a path to navigate around the traps while maintaining access to higher rows, eventually leading to the exit.\n\n### Selected Action:\nExecuting **ACTION_UP** to row 5, column 8 can start navigating towards the exit efficiently.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis move is expected to keep us on track towards the exit while avoiding the traps and maintaining the score as suggested in the strategy.

The exit is located at (2, 1), and there are some traps located at (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5). \n\nSince the avatar is currently with the blue coat, they can pass through blue walls, but there are no blue walls in the immediate vicinity, so their next action needs to be planned carefully to reach the exit while avoiding traps.\n\n### Immediate Considerations\n- Upwards (5, 8) is possible and open (normal wall).\n- Left (6, 7) and Right (6, 9) are both open too (normal wall).\n- The exit is 4 rows above in the second column, but several traps are in the way.\n\nBefore making a move, let\u2019s review:\n- The traps can be problematic, so I must navigate carefully to avoid penalties.\n- Utilizing the coat efficiently is crucial, even though it's not required immediately to reach the exit directly.\n\n### Plan\n1. Move up to (5, 8) to position closer to rows leading toward the exit.\n2. After moving, I should evaluate my position and decide on the next action based on the new surroundings.\n\nNow, I'll proceed with the action to move up.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this action will keep me on course toward the exit while avoiding traps."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is positioned at (6, 8), on a floor tile, and there is a blue coat available at (6, 8). The objective is to navigate through the maze, reach the exit (located at (2, 1)), and avoid traps (located at (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5)).\n\n### Current Analysis:\n- **Avatar Position:** (6, 8) \n- **Next Step Options:** I can collect the blue coat by moving left to (6, 7) as the blue coat (@) or moving to the exit (smart strategy).\n- **Potential Traps:** Moving carefully is crucial as the traps below at (2, 2) to (2, 5) can severely impact my progress.\n\n### Ideal Move:\nSince the blue coat is adjacent to my current position, I should attempt to collect it first, as it provides a strategic advantage to deal with any walls later in the level. Therefore, I will move **left** to (6, 7).\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\n**Feedback:** This action aims to collect the blue coat which will facilitate further progress by allowing me to interact with blue walls if needed. Additionally, this aligns with the strategy of maximizing advantages while exploring options before heading toward the exit. Let's see how that impacts the subsequent move."
