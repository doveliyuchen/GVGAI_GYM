The traps are at (2, 2) to (2, 5) and one more at (7, 1). Navigating efficiently while avoiding traps is the goal.\n\n### Strategy Recap:\n1. We need to find a clear path to the exit at (2, 1), avoiding traps and walls.\n2. The avatar can move in any of the four cardinal directions, but must avoid traps and walls.\n3. There are no immediate traps in the adjacent positions, meaning movement is safe if I choose to go left, right, up, or down.\n\nTo start navigating towards the exit, I\u2019ll move **up** which would bring the avatar to (8, 5). This will allow further upward or lateral movement afterward.\n\n```Action: 4``` \n\nBy moving up, I'm progressing toward the exit while assessing the surrounding tiles to plan my next move effectively."
