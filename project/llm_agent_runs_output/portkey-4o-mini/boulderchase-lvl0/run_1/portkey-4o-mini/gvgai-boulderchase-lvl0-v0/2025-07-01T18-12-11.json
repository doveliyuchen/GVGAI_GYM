The immediate surroundings include a mix of walls and dirt, which restrict movement options, and a collection of diamonds, boulders, and potential enemies in the environment that need to be navigated strategically.\n\n### Analyzing the current board:\n\n- The immediate row (row 11) shows that the avatar is surrounded by dirt (denoted by `*`), making lateral movement options somewhat limited. \n- Specifically, to the left (column 5) and right (column 7) are both spaces containing dirt, meaning no movement can occur in those directions. \n- The option to move down (to row 12, column 6) is also blocked by walls. The only available move would be to go back up (to row 10, column 6) or to analyze if there are any collectible diamonds or enemies to interact with.\n\n### Current available actions:\n\n1. **ACTION_USE** is not applicable since there is no specific item to use in the immediate vicinity.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT** and **ACTION_RIGHT** are not valid due to the presence of walls and obstacles.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN** is not valid as it's blocked by walls in the next row (row 12).\n4. **ACTION_UP** is the only valid move that can occur, moving back to row 10, column 6.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position remains unchanged despite potential previous directional actions, the next logical action based on analysis and to ensure positioning towards a better state would be to:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis should allow movement upwards (to row 10, column 6), re-evaluating the new position for further options to progress towards collectible diamonds or escape interactions."
