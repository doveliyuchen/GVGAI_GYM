However, the closest piranha is at (8, 5) which is relatively far from the avatar's position (8, 13), making it safe for now. The avatar also needs to avoid holes which are at (12, 1).\n\nIn determining the next action, we should also consider the strategy outlined earlier; the current plan is primarily to collect nearby coins and boxes if possible while avoiding threats.\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings, moving **UP to (7, 13)** or **LEFT to (8, 12)** are both good options. However, we'll note that (7, 13) is an open space and could potentially direct the avatar toward a more strategic position.\n\nTherefore, I will move UP.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThe expectation from this action is that it will keep the avatar safe while progressing in the map towards other collectibles."
