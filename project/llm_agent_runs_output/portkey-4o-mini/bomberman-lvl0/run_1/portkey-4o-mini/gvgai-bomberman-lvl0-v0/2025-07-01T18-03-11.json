The bomberman can safely move in any direction except into a wall or an enemy.\n2. Since there are free spaces around, advancing towards the goal at (row 2, col 14) is the priority.\n3. Each direction may not lead to immediate danger, but using bombs wisely is essential for clearing paths.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nMoving \"left\" to (row 4, col 8) provides a manageable advance without immediate threat from enemies, and afterwards, further movement plans can be devised from there.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis action will allow the bomberman to move left into an open space, setting up for strategy while keeping options open."
