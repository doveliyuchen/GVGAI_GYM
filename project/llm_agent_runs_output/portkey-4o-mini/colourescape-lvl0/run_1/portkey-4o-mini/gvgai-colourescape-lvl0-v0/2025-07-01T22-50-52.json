However, let's consider possible locations indicated in the map layout where the avatar might have already transitioned to a particular type (normal, red, blue, green).\n\n- **Goals & Obstacles:**\n  - The exit (`%`) is located at (1, 11).\n  - There are holes (`&`) that can cause the avatar to lose score and possibly end the game if the avatar reaches zero.\n  - Switches (`@` &) can change the avatar state and influence how boxes are manipulated.\n  \n- **Surrounding Terrain:** The area around the avatar will dictate what actions are feasible. Given the map has clear pathways (indicated by `.`) and more complex interactions (switches and boxes), the player can explore those.\n\n### Strategy for Movement:\n1. **Objective Focus:** Our immediate goal is to reach the exit efficiently. The exit at (1, 11) is within reach, but the spots you can access the exit from need to be clear.\n   \n2. **Switch and Box Utilization:** Checking the box positions and switches that can be manipulated to aid in reaching the exit can provide an advantage.\n  \n3. **Interaction Analysis:** Moving directly toward the exit sounds ideal, but one must evaluate if any current condition necessitates a change of avatar using switches before proceeding since changing could affect movement mechanics significantly.\n\n### Immediate Action Recommendation:\nIf the avatar's current position is at (1, 11) or not noted from the previous assessment, the safest action is to move towards the exit if it\u2019s straightforward. If the position needs adjusting (and depending on the avatar's type and immediate surroundings), the closest available path with the least risk and highest reward should be pursued.\n\nLet's say, assuming the avatar is on an open space directly one move away from the exit without hindrances, I would choose:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\n**Feedback:** This action attempts to move towards the exit; if feasible, it aligns perfectly with our strategy of prioritizing immediate access to win conditions.

Based on the map description, there is no indication that an avatar is currently placed on the board, as the only items present in the first few rows are either holes or the spaces not occupied by the avatar.\n\nOur strategy focuses on exploring the surroundings and identifying potential actions, particularly towards any switches or boxes.\n\nSince I don\u2019t see an avatar marker (`*`, `w`, `e`, etc.) in the current layout, I will take an initial action to gather information by moving to the open space near the existing spaces. The only movement option that seems available according to the map is moving right on the second row, as there are empty spaces nearby.\n\nGiven this understanding, I will proceed with this action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should move to the right, aiming to explore the area and interact with any potential game elements. My expectation is to reveal more information about the game layout or uncover other interaction points."
