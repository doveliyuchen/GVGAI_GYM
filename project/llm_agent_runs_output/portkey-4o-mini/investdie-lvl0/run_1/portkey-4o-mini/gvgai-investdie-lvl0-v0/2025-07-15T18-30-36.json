Next to your position to the right at (1, 2) is switch1 (represented as '#'). Below your position at (2, 1) and the available paths lead to empty floor tiles.\n\nSince your avatar is currently on a floor tile and not blocked by walls, you have the opportunity to move in various directions. The most beneficial action, considering the strategy you've laid out, is to move toward switch1 (at (1, 2)). Activating switch1 will also allow you to assess the result of the action while aiming for a time boost.\n\nI will now execute the action to move right to activate switch1:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to take me closer to activating switch1 and efficiently interacting with the game mechanics."

I can interact with the switch at (1, 6), as it is right next to my current position. This will also potentially lengthen the timer.\n2. Since there are no coins in close proximity directly, I will prioritize using Switch 2 first; I should maximize the effects of switching while keeping track of my score.\n\nI will take the action to interact with Switch 2:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will help me gain a time boost, and it aligns with the overall strategy of improving time management while navigating through the level."
