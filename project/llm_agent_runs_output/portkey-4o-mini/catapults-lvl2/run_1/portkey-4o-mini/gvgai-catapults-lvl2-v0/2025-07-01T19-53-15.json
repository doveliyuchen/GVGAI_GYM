Therefore, I'll assume your avatar is placed strategically to reach a goal or avoid other hazards.\n\n3. **Actions Available**: The available actions correspond to movement in different directions, but factor in the rotation mechanic that may affect movement.\n\n4. **Strategic Considerations**:\n   - The primary goal is to reach a goal while avoiding water.\n   - Maximizing movement and minimizing risk is crucial, especially since water can lead to losing the avatar.\n\n### Proposed Action\nAssuming the avatar is facing a direction that might allow it to move towards the nearest goal (i.e., `(14, 1)` or `(14, 14)`), I suggest taking the action that moves the avatar closer to one of these targets while staying clear of water.\n\nIf the avatar is initially at `(12, 1)`, moving down (action `3`) would lead you closer to a goal:\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\n\nThis action is expected to align with the strategy by potentially moving towards the goal located at `(14, 1)`. If the avatar holds a face-direction that allows it to avoid water and walls, this move should be effective in reaching the goal successfully."
