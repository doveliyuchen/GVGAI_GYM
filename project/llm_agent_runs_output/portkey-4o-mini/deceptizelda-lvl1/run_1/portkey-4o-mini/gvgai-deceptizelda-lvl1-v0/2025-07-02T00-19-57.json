Since no specific position of the avatar is given in the provided state, I'll assume it's in a neutral position to consider the surroundings strategically.\n\nFrom examining the layout, I note that:\n- There are several enemies represented by '$' (normal monster) and other items of interest including small goals '&', large goals '#', and keys '+'.\n- The avatar has a sword 'k' and is able to defeat enemies to gain points and score via interaction with goals.\n\nGiven the overall objective to maximize score and progress towards the winning condition, my action decision should focus on either approaching a goal or engaging with an enemy.\n\nSince I don\u2019t know the current position of the avatar, I will first check for an adverse position or the immediate area that might provide advantageous actions.\n\nI see a nearby enemy at coordinates (3,3) as well as some potential goals at (10,11) and (12,6). An optimal move could involve approaching the goal at (10,11) to gain a point.\n\nThus, I will choose to move my avatar to the right.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the smart strategy to gather goals, promoting an increase in score, while also navigating away from enemies at least for now. Expecting to see the avatar success in shifting position to interact more positively within the next state."
