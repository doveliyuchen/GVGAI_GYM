The surrounding tiles affect my potential actions in the following ways:\n\n- Tiles directly adjacent to the avatar:\n  - Up (0, 5): Water ('.')\n  - Down (2, 5): LandSand ('x')\n  - Left (1, 4): LandSand ('x')\n  - Right (1, 6): LandSand ('.')\n\nFrom this position, I have the following considerations:\n- There\u2019s water above and I cannot move there without sand. \n- Below me (2, 5) is a landSand tile, which can help me spawn sand.\n- The left tile (1, 4) is also landSand, same as right (1, 6).\n\nSince the goal is to collect sand to navigate further and there is a landSand directly below (2, 5) it makes sense to move downward to potentially collect more sand.\n\nI will then execute the action to move down.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to collect sand by moving to the landSand tile directly below. I expect that this aligns with my strategy of resource management and maintaining sufficient sand to navigate towards the goal."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, my avatar is positioned at (1, 5) and I have to devise a strategy to advance towards my goals while managing resources.\n\n### Current State Recap:\n- My avatar ('a') is at (1, 5).\n- The nearest goal ('g') is located at (9, 12).\n- There are two treasures ('t') located at (3, 13) and (0, 2) (but I can see the one at 3,13).\n- Throughout the map, there are walls ('x'), hazards (whirlpool 'p'), and bomb water ('@').\n\nGiven the available actions (such as moving left, right, up or down), the primary concern is to start moving toward an area that allows progress towards the treasure or the goal.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation:\n1. I need to assess whether I can move towards the treasure at (3, 13):\n   - From (1, 5), moving down would take me to (2, 5), which is open (water).\n   - Moving left or right would either lead to walls or hazards.\n  \n2. Resuming the strategy to manage resources effectively, I must also keep in mind that my immediate movement options are rather limited, and the goal is to avoid hazards while making progress.\n\n### Next Move:\nTo move closer to the goal or treasure, I will execute a downward action since it is currently the only feasible option to progress.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action is expected to keep progressing towards the next steps in my journey while maintaining safety from hazards as there are no immediate risks in the next cell (2, 5), allowing me to position closer toward further interactions."

    "content": "To determine the next action, we need to evaluate the current state and strategy to maximize our chances of winning the game. The avatar's current position is at (2, 5), surrounded by various elements of landSand, water, and some hazards.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n1. The avatar is on landSand (indicated by 'a' at (2, 5)).\n2. To the left (2, 4) and right (2, 6) are free cells (water), which means moving there won't immediately pose a danger.\n3. There are multiple treasures (t) below (3, 13) and a goal (g) at (9, 12).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- The objective is to collect sand for navigation and avoid hazards.\n- The goal (g) is quite far down, so we will need to navigate through various paths and potentially collect treasures.\n\n### Required Action:\nSince I am currently considering moving down, as moving down (3, 5) should keep me near land while also exploring treasures and ultimately be on the path toward the goal at the last row.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nFeedback: I expect that moving down will provide further exploration opportunities while keeping me safe since it would still be a landSand area."
