We can interact with raw pasta by moving to it and subsequently combine it with boiling water.\n\n### Potential Actions\n1. **Move Up (to (6, 3))**: This space is empty and could allow further movement, but wouldn't get us closer to the pasta or boiling water yet.\n2. **Move Down (to (8, 3))**: This space is also empty but takes us further down from other resources.\n3. **Move Left (to (7, 2))**: This space is empty as well, offering no advantage.\n4. **Move Right (to (7, 4))**: This space is empty too with no immediate resources.\n \nSince there are no immediate opportunities to collect ingredients directly next to the avatar, we need to make a movement decision that will enable subsequent actions more effectively.\n\n### Strategy Alignment\nBy first moving up, we can assess further options:\n- From (6, 3) we could move to (5, 3) which is again empty, then next explore around that area since moving down or left doesn't yield advantageous resources.\n\nThus, I will make the move:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n \nThis means I'm moving up. The expectation is to continue exploring potential areas for gathering resources while keeping an eye on walls, so I can plan from there on how to reach the key and pasta more effectively."

The only raw ingredient visible on the map right now is raw pasta located at (row=6, col=12), which would require some movement to collect.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation\n1. **Exploring Options**: Moving left towards the boiling water is both an immediate action I can take to prepare any ingredients, but I also want to keep in mind the potential need to collect raw ingredients or other useful items.\n2. **Potential Next Steps**: If I move left to (row=9, col=1), I\u2019ll be in a position to interact with the boiling water. However, if my goal shifts to collecting raw pasta, I'll need a more strategic pathway toward it.\n\n### Action Selection\nSince I can directly interact with the boiling water at (row=9, col=1), I will move left to activate it.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to the boiling water allows me to engage with it, which is important for cooking or preparing ingredients.
