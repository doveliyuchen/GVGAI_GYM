There are several obstacle types, including walls (`&`), water (`*`), and various floor types (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `g`, etc.).\n2. The avatar can potentially navigate the maze and must avoid water sprites to survive.\n3. The goal is located at (1, 1) indicated by `#`.\n\nTo strategize effectively, the following must be considered:\n- The avatar needs to approach the goal (1,1).\n- There are multiple water walls surrounding the area. The avatar should not come into contact with these hazards (denoted by `*`).\n- The avatar should explore pathways to avoid both water and walls effectively.\n\nSince the position of the avatar isn't explicitly stated in the layout, I will assume that I need to navigate toward the earliest part of the maze that appears viable, particularly with goals of winning by clearing or avoiding barriers.\n\n### Analyzing Actions\nAfter reviewing the map, I recommend moving toward the free cells closest to the goal and avoiding water.\n\nI choose the action based on the understanding that the avatar has to express a movement towards a more strategic location while keeping in mind the direction rotation mechanics.\n\nAssuming the avatar is currently at a starting point on an open cell, I will proceed to move:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n  \nThis action assumes the avatar is heading right, likely aiding in approaching free areas or aligning with the goal without hitting potential threats.

This is the main target.\n- Water sprites are present in the second row (1) from columns 2 to 14, which I need to avoid.\n- There are many walls '&' around, and my movement options will be limited by these walls.\n\nTo strategize:\n1. **Identify avatar position and move**: Since the mapping does not indicate where my avatar is positioned, I will initiate the direct path toward the goal (1, 1) if I assume I am somewhere around and need to avoid threats.\n\nGiven that the avatar may need to face left to approach or navigate (since to go towards the goal effectively I may need clear access), I would rotate first if necessary before moving.\n\nI will choose to move left, as the next action to take considering I may be positioned towards the right and need orientation adjustments.

(floor), which is safe but does not advance towards any goals.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT** to (5, 9) - This leads to a '*' (water), which would cause me to lose the avatar if I move there.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN** to (6, 8) - This leads to '&' (wall), which is an invalid move.\n4. **ACTION_UP** to (4, 8) - This also leads to '*' (water), leading to a loss if I move there.\n\nSince all direct actions either lead to water or a wall, I should instead rotate my avatar without moving (I will attempt to change direction in hopes of finding an action next). With that in mind, I will initiate a rotation and prepare to assess the next move after that.\n\nThus, I will choose: \n``` \nAction: 1 \n``` \n\nThis action aims to rotate the avatar to face left (towards (5, 7) which is open), and from that new position, I can look for movement options again next round.

The hazards comprise water (`*`) that can eliminate the avatar, while the walls (`&`) obstruct movement. \n\n3. The immediate objective is to get the avatar safely to the goal without losing any avatars. \n\nSince I can see the avatar is currently at (5, 8), I will consider the following actions:\n\nA critical look at nearby tiles highlights:\n- (5, 8) is clear if moving left to (5, 7) but potentially advantageous moving up to (4, 8) or down to (6, 8). \n- Since (4, 8) is where my avatar can shift without hitting the water directly, plus this brings me one step closer vertically to the goal (which is potentially a better strategic position).\n\nHence, I choose **to move up** from the current position.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis move aligns with the strategy of navigating while avoiding hazards, and I expect it to keep the game progressing towards the win condition by not wasting another avatar unnecessarily."
