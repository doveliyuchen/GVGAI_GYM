The nearby citizens are mostly cursed, and we can see many interactive objects (like boxes) that could help in managing their movement.\n2. The strategy involves avoiding bolts, guiding blessed citizens, blocking cursed citizens using walls, and maximizing the use of boxes to direct citizens effectively.\n\nSince I need to rotate towards a new direction to possibly engage the nearby blessed citizens and avoid cursing any further citizens, I will first make an upward move to align my actions better to transform citizens.  \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action aims to position my avatar effectively, aligning it with the strategy of managing cursed and blessed citizens."

We need to interact with citizens to transform them into blessed ones and avoid interactions that would turn them cursed.\n  \n2. **Obstacle Navigation**: Use walls strategically to block cursed entities and guide citizens safely towards the output ('b').\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: We need to stay clear of bolts ('#') and bears ('*') present on the map, as they can negatively affect our standing.\n   \n4. **Time Management**: We have a time limit to achieve our objectives; we need to act efficiently.\n\n5. **Planning Ahead**: We need to visualize our moves to prevent situations with multiple cursed sprites from occurring.\n\n### Map Analysis:\n- The avatar is at (12, 4), surrounded primarily by citizens ('c') and boxes ('$') in its vicinity.\n- The output point is located at (12, 31). \n- The immediate actions available for the avatar include:\n  - Moving left (to (12, 3), which is occupied by a citizen).\n  - Moving right (to (12, 5), which is occupied by a citizen).\n  - Moving down (to (13, 4), which has a wall).\n  - Moving up (to (11, 4), which has a citizen). \n\nSince the avatar's current position contains only citizens, the focus should either be to transform them or guide them towards the output while avoiding interactions that could turn them cursed.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nTo start effectively managing the citizens, I will move left to (12, 3) where there is a citizen, proposing potential interactions with them as I progress. \n\n``` Action:1 ``` \nThis action allows for engaging with a citizen, attempting transformation or movement towards the output. I expect to see a beneficial interaction with the citizens as per the strategy."

There are input citizens represented by '%' at (12, 0) and (12, 1), and there's an output represented by 'b' at (12, 31). The strategy suggests managing citizens effectively and transforming them as needed while avoiding cursed transformations and harmful sprites.\n\nSince the avatar\u2019s position (12, 3) is currently surrounded by citizens and walls, and based on the strategy provided, a good action would be to move toward the input citizen at (12, 0) to potentially transform them.\n\nGiven the pathways and goals:\n- Moving left from (12, 3) to (12, 2) to get closer to the input citizen should help with initiating the process of managing the citizens effectively.\n\nThus, I will execute the action to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action is expected to position the avatar closer to the input citizen and open up further potential moves for citizen management."

It would be strategic to perform actions that help move or interact with nearby citizens to transform them while ensuring that you don't inadvertently allow a cursed sprite to appear.\n\nThe best action is to move right to (row 12, col 3) where there is a citizen (c). This would allow you to start the engagement with the nearest citizen.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action is expected to facilitate immediate transformation opportunities with citizens, aligning with the strategy of citizen management."
