The strategy suggests needing to maximize citizen transformations and manage threat levels, particularly avoiding curses.\n2. Considering the avatar\u2019s current position, there are multiple citizens close by on row 12 (from (12, 1) to (12, 8)).\n3. To effectively convert citizens and avoid cursed ones, the avatar should proceed towards one of the nearby citizens for interaction.\n\nGiven that moving vertically won't yield immediate engagement with such transformative opportunities near the avatar, we should move left to position adjacent to a citizen:\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis should allow the avatar to engage with the citizens promptly while maintaining an approach toward potential 'salvation' sprite interactions in the subsequent turn. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy by moving closer to transform citizens while being wary of threats."

The avatar should move toward the citizen positions to facilitate interactions for transformations.\n   \n2. **Avoiding Threats**: Keeping an eye on the projectiles ('bolt') near (1, 21) and (1, 22), and avoiding interactions with curses and demons is crucial.\n\n3. **Wall Navigation**: The walls on the map will guide movements and may provide cover from projectiles.\n\n### Immediate Action\nTo start, it would be strategic to move towards an available citizen to maximize interaction potential. Therefore, moving left toward the citizens at (12, 8) seems like an optimal move.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will help the avatar position itself closer to citizens, allowing for potential blessings and avoiding the cursed state, in alignment with the strategy of citizen management."
