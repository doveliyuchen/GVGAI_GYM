Moving left or right may help in evaluating the next steps.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that my current position is assumed to be row 2 (up from the camels), moving UP towards row 1 may lead me directly into the camels. Instead, I will check the map and approach right (col 33) to potentially gear towards areas less populated by camels.\n\n**Action will be:**\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will help navigate towards an area with more space and allow planning for the next move based on whether I encounter more camels or reach an open area leading toward the goal."
