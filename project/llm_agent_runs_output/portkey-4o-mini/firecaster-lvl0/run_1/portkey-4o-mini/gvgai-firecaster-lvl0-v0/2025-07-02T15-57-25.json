Considering the possible moves:\n- Moving left is blocked by a wall.\n- Moving right will place the avatar into an empty space (row 8, col 5).\n- Moving down will also place the avatar into an empty space (row 9, col 4).\n- Moving up will interact with a box.\n\n### Plan:\nSince the priority is to move towards an open space and create potential paths:\n1. **Moving Right** (to row 8, col 5) seems viable as it allows the avatar to explore the right side, where there are more opportunities to reach the top row with fewer walls blocking.\n2. After moving, I may need to evaluate how to utilize my resources (like bullets for box manipulation or gathering mana).\n\nThus, I will proceed with the action to move right.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action will open up more paths to explore, hopefully leading towards the goal more efficiently."
