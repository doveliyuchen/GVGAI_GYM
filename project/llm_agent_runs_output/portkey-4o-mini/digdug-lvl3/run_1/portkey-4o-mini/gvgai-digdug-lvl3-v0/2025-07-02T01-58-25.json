Additionally, you have an entrance ('&') at (13, 25).\n\nStrategically, your main objectives are to avoid or defeat monsters and collect goodies. Since the monster is adjacent to your position, moving away from it is the best course of action to minimize the risk of loss.\n\nTo proceed, I will move the avatar to the left (to (13, 0)), which is a wall ('%'). This action will involve rotation, and as a result, won't change the avatar's position. Instead, I will attempt to move again.\n\nNext, I will try moving down to (14, 1) instead, where the cell is also a wall ('%'). However, since there's an entrance available, the optimal choice seems to be moving right towards an open space.\n\nNow, considering these factors, my action will be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis means I will attempt to move left, though I expect it won't move due to the wall. My eventual goal would be to maneuver around the monster while keeping my potential options open."

    "content": "In the current state, your avatar is positioned at (13, 1), right next to a monster at (13, 4) and near the entrance at (13, 25). \n\nGiven the game's win/loss conditions and the immediate threats from the monsters, the priority is to ensure your safety while considering potential actions.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n1. **Moving Left (Action 2)**: This would move your avatar to (13, 0), which is a wall ('%'). Thus, this is not a valid move.\n   \n2. **Moving Right (Action 3)**: This would move your avatar to (13, 2), which is empty ('.'). This action does not confront the monster and allows further movement options.\n\n3. **Moving Up (Action 5)**: This action would move your avatar to (12, 1), which is also empty ('.'). It still keeps you away from the monster but does not lead you closer to collectibles.\n\n4. **Moving Down (Action 4)**: This would move your avatar to (14, 1), which is again a wall ('%'). Thus, this move is not valid.\n\n5. **Using (Action 1)**: There aren't any specific items mentioned that you can use. This action does not lead to any change as no specific tools or actions are applicable at this moment.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven the current position of the avatar and the surrounding threats, moving **Right to (13, 2)** is the most strategic choice as it allows you to stay away from the immediate threat posed by the monster while providing further movement options towards other areas of the map.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action helps maintain your position safely while exploring further without confronting the monster directly."

(empty)\n  - Down (14, 2) -> '%' (wall)\n\nThe only available non-threatening moves are to the left (which we've already determined is safe) or moving up (which remains a safe action). However, moving further right is dangerous due to the monster. Based on the strategies discussed earlier:\n\n**Best Action:**\nSince the avatar is unable to directly confront the monster (as it would lead to a loss of life), the optimal strategy is to move left into the empty tile.\n\nThus, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis move helps avoid confrontation with the monster, maintaining the avatar's safety and aligning with the strategy of avoiding direct confrontation when possible."
