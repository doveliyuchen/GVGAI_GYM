The obstacles include walls '%', water '.', and various boxes '@' at different locations. There are also potential bomb interactions which can be used to clear paths or create hazards.\n\nSince my avatar is currently positioned at (9, 1), I have several options. However, I should first check for potential movements without encountering walls or hazardous water. Moving left to (9, 0) is blocked by a wall, while moving right to (9, 2) is clear but does not provide immediate strategic advancement towards the goal sprite. Similarly, moving up to (8, 1) and down to (10, 1) will not lead to progress due to walls or exceeding the bounds.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next logical action is to move:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis rightward movement allows me to approach clear spots toward (9, 2), progressing strategically while avoiding immediate hazards and positioning myself better for the following turns. I expect to continue assessing movement without encountering a wall at (9, 2)."
