Here\u2019s a summary of what is visible:\n\n- My avatar ('a') is located at row 10, column 0.\n- The environment contains several alien enemies ('@') at various locations (specifically at rows 3 to 6).\n- There are bombs ('$') located at rows 3 and 4, which can cause damage to my avatar.\n- The overall objective is to eliminate alien spawn points and avoid collisions.\n\nGiven that my avatar's position does not change from the last state (as it\u2019s at the same spot: row 10, col 0), I must take a meaningful action.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- Staying mobile is crucial as there are bombs within proximity.\n- There are aliens present in the rows above my position. Eliminating them will help manage the threats.\n\n### Action Selection:\n1. The **left action (ACTION_LEFT)** would not result in movement as we are at the leftmost column (0).\n2. The **right action (ACTION_RIGHT)** will move me to column 1, away from the current threat of bombs while still allowing me to engage with the enemies above.\n3. The **action_use (ACTION_USE)** is not applicable because I have no projectiles to fire according to the current sprite layout.\n\nSince moving right seems to present the best option for avoiding direct danger from bombs and possibly allowing future actions to eliminate threats:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI anticipate this aligns with the strategy of maintaining mobility and avoiding bomb collisions."

The closest enemy appears to be at (4, 4).\n2. **Assess Threats**: There are bombs nearby (located at (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 1), and (4, 2)). Since I am trying to avoid enemy projectiles, I need to keep that in mind while moving.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince movement is critical to getting closer to the clusters of aliens while avoiding bombs, I will opt for moving right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left will allow me to navigate through the map more effectively and closer to the aliens while continuing to avoid threats from the bombs."
