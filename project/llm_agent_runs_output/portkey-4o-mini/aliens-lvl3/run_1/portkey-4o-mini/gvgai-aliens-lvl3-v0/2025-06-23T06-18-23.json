There are many alien threats nearby in rows above my position, specifically `@` symbols representing the aliens, and potential bombs depicted as `%` and `&` towards the lower rows.\n\n**Positioning insight:**\n- My current position does not have any immediate threats (aliens) in adjacent spaces, which gives me a moment to decide my next action safely.\n- The primary threats are concentrated above, thus I might want to navigate towards them to engage and eliminate.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **ACTION_USE**: This action would be relevant if a nearby alien or interaction requires engaging my weapon.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT**: I would move left to `(row=10, col=1)` which doesn't move towards the threats but sidesteps me.\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT**: I would move right to `(row=10, col=3)`, which also keeps me on the same row without progressing towards the aliens.\n\nSince my last action didn\u2019t change position, I will now take ACTION_LEFT or ACTION_RIGHT to orient myself better to engage with the alien threats vertically above me.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will take `ACTION_RIGHT` as it allows me to explore the space in `col=3` and might provide a clearer sightline for anticipating actions against the aliens above.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aligns with my strategy to get into a position where I can effectively engage the alien threats while avoiding immediate danger.
