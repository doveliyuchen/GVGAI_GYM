The direction in which you can move will influence your ability to collect resources or avoid enemies effectively.\n\n### Analysis\nIn the current layout:\n- The avatar is positioned at (11, 11).\n- To the left (11, 10) is free space (.), to the right (11, 12) is a boulder (@), above (10, 11) is a boulder (@), and below (12, 11) is a crab (c).\n- Additionally, there are valuable items (diamonds) nearby, particularly at (10, 8) and (10, 7), which could be useful for scoring.\n\n### Current Objective\n1. Avoid the direct encounter with the crab directly below.\n2. Consider movement options that keep your avatar clear of enemies while enabling resource collection.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince rotating would not change your position, a valid strategy to reposition away from the immediate threat of the crab below and also possibly inch closer to additional resources is to move left to the empty space (11, 10).\n\n### Executing Action\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis left movement is expected to allow your avatar to avoid the crab while maintaining a strategic position to gather nearby resources in subsequent turns."
