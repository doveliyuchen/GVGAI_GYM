However, the surrounding positions to the right are also open and could be explored.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the importance of collecting the key eventually and trying to optimize the route, let's move down to `(2, 3)` where we can potentially manipulate the box on our next turn.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow exploration to a position where we can utilize the box further in subsequent moves."
