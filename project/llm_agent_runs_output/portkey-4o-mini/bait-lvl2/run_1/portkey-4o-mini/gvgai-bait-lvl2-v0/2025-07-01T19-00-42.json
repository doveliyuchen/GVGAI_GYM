Thus, to try to strategically navigate towards the key, I will attempt to go **left** as a starting point, albeit with caution due to the presence of walls around.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is directed towards the left, as no other movement option seems feasible to achieve progress towards the key."

My first objective is to reach the key located at (2, 6) in order to transform the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey'.\n2. I must navigate around walls and hazards on my way to the key.\n3. To reach there, I can't directly move left or right, because there are walls blocking those directions (at row 2).

There are multiple hazards surrounding the avatar, including walls (`b`) and mushrooms (`&`), which I must navigate around.\n\nMy immediate objective is to reach the key. To do this, I need to first move towards the key's position. Given the mechanics provided, the avatar cannot move through walls, so I will need to move through open spaces and possibly manipulate boxes (`@`) along the way.\n\nFrom the current position of the avatar at `(7, 6)`, I can move:\n\n- Up to `(6, 6)`: This is valid since it leads to another box (`@`).\n- Down to `(8, 6)`: This is valid but doesn't lead directly to a key or a goal.\n- Left to `(7, 5)`: Invalid, as this is a wall (`b`).\n- Right to `(7, 7)`: Invalid, as this is also a wall (`b`).\n\nTo reach the key, I will move **up**, to position `(6, 6)` where there is a box I could potentially use afterwards.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow me to move the avatar closer towards retrieving the key. Let\u2019s see if this aligns with the strategy to navigate the obstacles effectively."

I expect to start creating movement options while ensuring safety from adjacent hazards."
