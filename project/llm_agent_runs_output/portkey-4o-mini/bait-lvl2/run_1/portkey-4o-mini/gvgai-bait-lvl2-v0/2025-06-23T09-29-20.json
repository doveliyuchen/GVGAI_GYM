The map indicates that our avatar ('a') is currently not explicitly placed in the provided state (given the absence of 'a' in the mapping). However, the presence of the 'nokey' floor indicated by '*' means that we likely need to help our avatar (if we assume it starts with) collect the key at the relevant locations before reaching the goal.\n\n### Analyzing the Map Layout:\n- The key '%' is located at (2, 6).\n- The goal '#' is located at (8, 7).\n- Hazards include '0' (holes) and '&' (mushrooms).\n\nGiven that the avatar might be near the floor area but not defined, we presume the starting position is somewhere in close proximity to approach the nearest item (key).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Immediate Objective**: The main goal is to collect the key at (2, 6). We can see that it is imperative to reach the key first to transform the state of the avatar.\n2. **Safe Path**: The surrounding layout indicates several walls (b), hazards (0 and &), and we want to avoid those areas while navigating towards the key.\n\nWith this analysis, here's a plausible action given that there's no explicit avatar location provided:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nMoving down (ACTION_DOWN) aims to approach the key since our former location wasn't specified with 'a,' this action is performed in a general downward movement towards the key coordinates. I would expect that this aligns the avatar towards moving efficiently towards its goal of obtaining the key. But if further rotations or other actions are needed after this, that can be adjusted accordingly."

This means the avatar does not currently possess the key and is located at the coordinates (8, 6).\n\n### Objectives and Nearby Elements\n- The immediate goal is to reach the goal gate ('#') located at (8, 7) but to do so successfully, the avatar needs to collect the key ('%') located at (2, 6) first.\n- Hazards such as holes ('$') are present in the area, particularly near the path to the key, making navigation risky.\n- The next closest area is largely empty ('.') with also boxes ('@') on the map, which could potentially facilitate movement if utilized properly.\n\n### Current State Analysis\nI need to avoid the mushrooms ('&') because they would eliminate the avatar upon contact. My current position (8, 6) puts me adjacent to the goal (8, 7), but without the key, I cannot score.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n- Moving left or right will not benefit the current objective since I need to get to the key first. Instead, I should consider moving upwards towards (7, 6) to navigate through the map safely.\n- From (7, 6), further movements can be planned towards the key.\n\n### Next Action\nThe best move for the avatar is to go UP to (7, 6).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is intended to navigate towards an open space without hazards, supporting careful planning towards collecting the key and subsequently reaching the goal."

Moving to the goal while possessing the key will yield points.\n\n### Current Movements:\n- After inspecting the map:\n  - The avatar cannot move left (8, 5) because of boundaries.\n  - Moving down (9, 6) is blocked by the wall.\n  - Moving right (8, 7) is actually the goal. \n  - Moving up (7, 6) leads to a space where the avatar does not have the key.\n\nCurrently, the avatar's viable actions will result in a rotation issue as it cannot proceed directly. Thus, we need to choose an action that maintains an objective of moving towards the key (2, 6).\n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo progress towards the key, the avatar should first move up (to (7, 6)).
