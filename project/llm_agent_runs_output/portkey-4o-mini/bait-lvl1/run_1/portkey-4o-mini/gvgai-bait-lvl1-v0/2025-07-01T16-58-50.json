The goal is located at (1, 6) and there is a key available at position (7, 6).\n\nTo achieve the goal of reaching the goal sprite, I must first collect the key. The strategy suggests prioritizing the key, and moving in that direction, while avoiding any obstacles. I will move down to position (4, 6) where I will have the option to continue towards the key at (7, 6).\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar down one position, which will bring me closer to the key sprite. I expect this aligns with the strategy of collecting the key before heading to the goal."
