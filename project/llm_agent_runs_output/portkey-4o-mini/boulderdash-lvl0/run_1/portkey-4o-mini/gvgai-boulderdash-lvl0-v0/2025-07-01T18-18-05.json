The immediate possible actions from the current position (to adjacent cells):\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (11, 5): '.' (empty space).\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (11, 7): '.' (empty space).\n   - Moving **DOWN** to (12, 6): 'b' (wall).\n   - Moving **UP** to (10, 6): '.' (empty space).\n\n### Decision Making:\nConsidering the avatar is currently on an empty space, moving either left or right would not bring any immediate danger. However, moving upwards provides another option to navigate different paths ahead. There are numerous '*' exit doors reported, which are of high importance.\n\n**Optimal Move**: Move UP to explore further. \n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\nThis action should lead to further exploration and help us gauge what diamonds or resources can be collected while monitoring the score along the way."

There are also resources (diamonds) to collect, but it's crucial to manage the number of diamonds to meet the exit condition.\n\nTo strategize effectively, we should consider the next best action:\n\n1. **Movement Options**: The available movements from position (11, 6) are:\n   - Left to (11, 5) - which is dirt.\n   - Right to (11, 7) - which is dirt.\n   - Up to (10, 6) - which is also dirt.\n   - Down to (12, 6) - which is another wall.\n\n2. **Interactions**: Direct interaction with the crab at (11, 3) is risky (it could make us lose lives), but it could also lead to diamond transformations if strategized well. However, our immediate environment suggests that avoiding confrontation is prudent.\n\n3. **Diamond Collection**: The immediate strategy should be to collect nearby diamonds, as they are essential for scoring while keeping track of the exit condition.\n\n### Next Move\nThe best next action is to move **Right to (11, 7)** to navigate toward the nearby diamonds without engaging the crab.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move keeps me safe from the crab and points me closer to potential diamond resources to collect on future turns."
