The closest notable action point is at (row 12, col 23), where the street (`*`) is located, which will likely facilitate vehicle movement and scoring if I can navigate toward it quickly and without triggering the car crash state.\n\nGiven the position of the avatar and the environmental layout, I need to assess the possible actions considering that my previous action may have resulted in no movement.\n\nAssessing the available actions:\n1. **Movement Options**: I can move left to (12, 16), right to (12, 18), down to (13, 17), or up to (11, 17). However, I am closer to navigating toward the street, so moving right seems strategic.\n2. **Car Collision Risk**: I need to avoid colliding with cars which is not a nearby concern right now as the obstacles appear to be walls or empty spaces.\n\nSince the avatar's position is pivotal, I will attempt to move right as it aligns with my goal to access the street.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should move me toward the street area, and I expect to see the avatar making progress toward the scoring area without triggering any negative effects."

(floor). \n\nSince the last movement might have resulted in no change, it's crucial to check for possible rotations. The avatar can potentially move left or right into an open space, as moving up or down is restricted by walls.\n\nFor this strategy, since we want to avoid being stuck in the same position and also have an open path nearby, I will choose to move right to (12, 19).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to move to an open space.
