The player must navigate through the level effectively to reach it.\n- There are destructible walls 'b' and numerous enemies scattered throughout the map, notably bats '@', spiders '&', and scorpions '%'.\n- Direct connections to the goal are blocked by walls, and careful planning will be needed to clear the path.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n1. **Proximity to Enemies**: Nearby enemies (bats at (2, 3) and (7, 3), spider at (5, 10), scorpions at (1, 9) and (2, 16)) could obstruct progress. Use bombs to create space or defeat them if they pose a threat.\n2. **Plan for Movement and Bombing**: Assess where to place bombs efficiently to break through walls while ensuring the bomberman remains safe from explosion damage.\n3. **Critical Action Required**: The first immediate action should focus on moving towards a safe area or preparing to start breaking walls strategically.\n\nSince the last action has not changed the position of the avatar (still at (7, 18)), I will choose to move down to (8, 18) to analyze the lower row for any further opportunities or threats. \n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis actions prepares for observing the next row which may present clearer paths or indicate enemy positioning."
