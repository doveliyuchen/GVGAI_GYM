The goal sprite is located at (1, 13), significantly above the avatar's position. There are no immediate hazards around, but the road above the current position has truck hazards and the goal sprite will require careful navigation to reach.\n\n1. The first action to consider is to move the avatar upward to move closer to the goal sprite.\n2. It is important to note that the path should traverse around any hazards (trucks) found in later rows.\n3. Given that the last action can lead to stopping movement due to wall interaction, the avatar is not currently blocked and can move upwards.\n\nLet's proceed with the action to move:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI expect to see the avatar move up one position to (8, 8), which will begin the journey towards reaching the goal while keeping an eye on the hazards."
