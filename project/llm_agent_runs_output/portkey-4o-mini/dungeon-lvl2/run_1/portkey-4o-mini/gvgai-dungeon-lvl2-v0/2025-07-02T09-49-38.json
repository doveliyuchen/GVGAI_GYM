The exit is at (19, 1).\n\n4. **Strategic Movement:**\n   - Since there are several 'k' (key floors) available, it would be prudent to collect the gold first, especially those located close to the avatar\u2019s starting position.\n   - The exit is just two squares to the left of the position (19, 1) where the avatar would need to reach within the available movement options.\n\nGiven the information assumptions, it's likely the avatar's last recorded position is important for further movement. If no movement has occurred, to avoid traps and hazards, we need a step towards reaching an advantageous position closer to collecting gold or the exit.\n\nLet\u2019s move left towards any closest gold or key collected so far.

Based on the provided sprite mapping, it seems that the player avatar (represented as `a`) is positioned among numerous key (`k`), gold (`&`), exit (`$`), and trap items.\n\nSince there isn't any specific information about the avatar's current position in the provided state, I will assume the last known actions have resulted in no change in position. According to the game mechanics, I need to ensure movement based on the current game state layout, focusing on strategic exploration toward advancing in the game.\n\nGiven the gameplay strategy, my next move should be focused on collecting valuable items. Observing the map, I can see that:\n- The gold at (1,1), (1,2), (1,15), (6,8), (6,20), (19,3) is readily accessible.\n- There are multiple keys (`k`), providing ample opportunities to explore locked areas or subsequent challenges after collecting necessary resources.\n\nIn absence of a distinct update on avatar's position, I must choose a directional action that logically moves towards a piece of gold which will provide scoring benefits.\n\nNext, upon surveying the layout and collecting the gold is essential, I will choose the action to move right, since there are gold items located in that direction. Therefore, \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this to enhance our score and potentially uncover more paths to advance through the game."

The most significant items available seem to be the keys and gold, located in rows 1 and 2.\n2. The exit (`$`) is located at (19, 1).\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven that the avatar requires movement towards valuable items and potentially towards the exit, let's take a step downwards to navigate through the first few rows filled with `k` and `&`:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is that this action leads the avatar down into a row filled with keys, which provides opportunities to collect worthwhile resources while preparing to move further towards the exit."
