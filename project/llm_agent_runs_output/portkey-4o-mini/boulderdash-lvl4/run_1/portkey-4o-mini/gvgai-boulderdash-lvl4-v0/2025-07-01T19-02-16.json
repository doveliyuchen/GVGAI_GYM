The exit door at (10, 6) is immediately reachable from the avatar's current position, but the player has to have collected at least 9 diamonds.\n2. To achieve this, the player should collect nearby diamonds first before attempting to move towards the exit.\n\n### Next Steps\nNext to the avatar at (11, 6):\n- Up (to (10, 6)): **Exit Door (reachable but block due to the diamond condition)**\n- Down (to (12, 6)): **Background b**\n- Left (to (11, 5)): **Background .**\n- Right (to (11, 7)): **Background .**\n\n### Available Diamonds in Proximity\nFrom the current position, the diamonds are scattered across the following coordinates:\n- (11, 20) - A diamond is present.\n- (11, 14) - Another diamond is present.\n- (11, 18) - Another diamond.\n- (4, 1) - is a diamond.\n- (4, 16) - another diamond.\n- (4, 7) - another diamond.\n- (7, 4) - another diamond.\n\nThe goal is to collect those, to reach at least 9 diamonds.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the avatar can only collect diamonds by moving, the best action is to start maneuvering towards the collected diamonds. First, a move without immediate consequence such as moving up (11, 6) to (10, 6) doesn\u2019t contribute to gathering diamonds. \n\nThe action of moving to **(11, 5)** is non-productive too since it leads to nothing.\n\nSince the area is explored, the next action should ensure a diamond collection.\n\n### Action Decision\nMoving to the unblocked area (left) will not add immediate benefit but searching to the right avoids the unnecessary movements without risk of danger. \n\nLet's move toward the left to (11, 5).\n\nThe chosen action is:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThe feedback: This action moves left to collect additional information about nearby sprites and locate available diamonds yet interactively gain a space toward the next action direction.

The surrounding layout reveals several potential actions related to resource collection and enemy navigation. \n\nFirstly, the goal is to collect diamonds ('x') to reach the exit door ('*') with a minimum of 9 diamonds in hand. \n\nCurrently, our avatar is situated in a relatively safe zone populated with static entities and some collectibles:\n\n- There are multiple diamonds within reach:\n  - At (row 4, col 1) : diamond\n  - At (row 4, col 7) : diamond\n  - At (row 4, col 16) : diamond\n  - At (row 5, col 24) : diamond\n  - At (row 6, col 7) : diamond\n  - At (row 7, col 6) : diamond\n  - At (row 7, col 7) : diamond\n  - At (row 11, col 20) : diamond\n  - At (row 10, col 18) : diamond\n  \nI should strategically navigate towards the nearest collectable diamond while avoiding obstacles and enemies. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **Move Up to (10, 16)**: This position is clear (empty).\n2. **Move Down to (12, 16)**: This position is obstructed by walls and not an option.\n3. **Move Left to (11, 15)**: This position is clear (empty).\n4. **Move Right to (11, 17)**: This position contains a resource (sword).\n  \nEach action carries the potential for score change, and we need to ensure movement does not lead to a loss. \n\nI will proceed to move **Right to (11, 17)** to collect the sword ('s') and plan my next moves based on that.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action makes sense as it takes me closer to collecting more resources while ensuring I have access to the sword for potential combat scenarios. I expect to assess the sword's utility after this turn, aligning with my strategy of resource collection and score maximization."

The next immediate objective is to collect diamonds and navigate towards the exit door.\n\nLet's analyze the immediate surroundings:\n- **Direct Actions Available**: \n  - Up (row 10, col 16): `&` (dirt)\n  - Down (row 12, col 16): `b` (wall)\n  - Left (row 11, col 15): `.` (background)\n  - Right (row 11, col 17): `@` (boulder)\n\nFrom this positioning, moving down is not possible because of the wall. Moving right towards the boulder is risky as it may lead to being blocked, while left might provide a way to maneuver into more paths.\n\nGiven the immediate objectives, I will attempt to move left to provide more options for subsequent turns, aiming to collect more diamonds.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis strategy allows me to move towards an open area and plan better for collecting diamonds in the next moves while avoiding potential threats."

The current position of my avatar is at (11, 16). \n\n### Analysis of the State:\n- The entities around my avatar's position (11, 16) are:\n  - At (11, 15): an empty space (.)\n  - At (11, 17): a sword (@)\n  - At (11, 18): a diamond (%)\n  - At (10, 16): a butterfly (#)\n  - At (12, 16): a wall (b)\n  \n### Objectives and Strategy:\n1. **Collect Diamonds**: The only diamond (at (11, 18)) is very close to my avatar's current position. Collecting this will help increase my score.\n2. **Avoid Enemies**: There is a butterfly to the north (at (10, 16)) that I need to be cautious about. Interaction with it can lead to a score decrement.\n3. **Collecting the Sword**: There is a sword at (11, 17), which may help with interactions if needed, but priority should be diamond collection first.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will move right to collect the diamond.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to not only increase my score by obtaining the diamond but also help me progress towards the primary objective of collecting a total of at least 9 diamonds."

There are enemies (represented by '@') within reachable proximity, and I need to prioritize collecting diamonds while avoiding confrontations with enemies such as the crabs ('$') and butterflies ('#').\n\nGiven the position of the exit door ('*') at (10, 6), I need to maximize my score by gathering diamonds ('%') while being cautious of the dangers nearby. \n\nThe available diamond locations nearby are:\n\n- (4, 7), (4, 16), (4, 18)\n- (6, 7), (6, 24)\n- (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 19)\n- (11, 20), (11, 21), (11, 24)\n\nConsidering the strategic gameplay of avoiding encounters and resource maximization, my current position allows me to approach a diamond immediately below at (12, 16), which is directly accessible. There are no immediate threats in this downward direction.\n\nThus, I will execute the action to move downward to collect the diamond at (11, 16).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of prioritizing diamond collection while ensuring that I avoid enemies, and it should enhance my score for proceeding toward the exit effectively."
