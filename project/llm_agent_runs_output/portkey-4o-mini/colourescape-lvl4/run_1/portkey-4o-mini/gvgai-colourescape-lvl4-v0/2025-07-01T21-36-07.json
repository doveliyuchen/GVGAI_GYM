To progress towards the exit ('%') located at (6, 16), I need to analyze the surroundings and available actions:\n\n- The current position of the avatar is surrounded by several elements:\n  - Up: (0, 2) - wall ('r')\n  - Down: (2, 2) - hole ('h')\n  - Left: (1, 1) - empty ('.')\n  - Right: (1, 3) - empty ('.')\n\nActions I can take:\n1. Move **Left** to (1, 1) - this will change the position to an empty space.\n2. Move **Right** to (1, 3) - this will also change the position to an empty space, keeping further options open.\n3. Move **Up** or **Down** is not viable, as Up hits a wall and Down leads to a hole.\n\nSince the avatar's possible actions are limited by the surrounding walls and holes, the optimal first move will be to go **Right** to (1, 3), which keeps the movement continuous towards navigating around obstacles and making further decisions.\n\nThus, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis move seems strategic as it ensures that I stay on a safe path while approaching the exit, allowing for future options to explore further movements."

The goal is to reach the exit (represented by '%') located at position (6, 16).\n\nTo proceed toward the exit, I will need to evaluate potential movements based on the adjacent cells. \n\n- The avatar can move either left (to (1, 2)), right (to (1, 4)), down (to (2, 3)), or up (to (0, 3)).\n- The left position (1, 2) is a free space ('.').\n- The right position (1, 4) is also a free space ('.').\n- The down position (2, 3) is a green box ('$'), which can aid in jumping or moving forward.\n- The up position (0, 3) is a wall ('r').\n\nGiven that moving down to (2, 3) will place the avatar on a green box which can potentially provide forward movement, I will choose that action.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down onto the green box will set me on the right path toward reaching the exit. I expect to progress forward and gain the necessary momentum to continue towards the exit."
