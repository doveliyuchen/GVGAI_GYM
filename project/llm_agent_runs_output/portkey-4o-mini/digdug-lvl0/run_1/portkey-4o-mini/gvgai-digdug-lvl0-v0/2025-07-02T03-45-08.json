Hence, we need to find an alternative approach to initiate movement.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe best next action is to first move left to potentially expand options and create a permutation with the avatar's positioning. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is safe because it allows for movement towards neutral tiles while reevaluating opportunities for collecting goodies in subsequent turns."
