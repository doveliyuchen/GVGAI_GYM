However, it's crucial to position the avatar towards reaching the exit at (1, 14).\n2. **Avoid Traps**: There are traps located at (3, 14) and (12, 8), so we should carefully maneuver to avoid those.\n3. **Collect Coats**: Given the proximity of the coats, it may be beneficial to collect them based on the avatar's initial position to utilize transformation abilities.\n4. **Planning Moves**: Subsequent moves should be directed toward reaching the exit while carefully avoiding traps and making use of walls strategically.\n\n### Selected Action:\nWithout having the specific starting position of the avatar, I will assume that the avatar's position is initially not in a blocked state or immediately near traps. I will take a step toward navigating left since there are many walls, and we may need to find an initial position to then plan further actions effectively.\n\nThe anticipated action is: \n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should help me move left, potentially aligning with the opening to navigate through the game efficiently, assess surroundings, and optimize next moves depending on the position changes.
