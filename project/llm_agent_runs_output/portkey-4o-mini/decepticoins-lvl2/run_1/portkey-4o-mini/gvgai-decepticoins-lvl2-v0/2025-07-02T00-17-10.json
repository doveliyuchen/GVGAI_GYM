Since I cannot rotate without moving forward, the best action would be to move:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will reposition the avatar to a safer spot while planning to move toward possible strategies next round, enabling assessments of how to eliminate nearby boxes or navigate around obstacles."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar ('a') is positioned at (8, 13). The immediate surroundings consist of various obstacles, including holes (0), boxes (@), and empty floor (.). \n\nTo follow the strategy, it's crucial to consider the following:\n\n1. **Win Condition:** You need to eliminate boxes, and currently, there\u2019s one box located at (8, 16).\n2. **Danger from Piranha:** Ensure that you can't be cornered by the piranha which was not specifically mentioned in the immediate vicinity, but needs to be monitored.\n3. **Available Actions:** The next available actions involve moving in different directions, but it's crucial to determine which direction will engage the box effectively while managing threats.\n\n### Analysis of Potential Moves:\n- Moving **UP (7, 13)** does not get you closer to the box.\n- Moving **DOWN (9, 13)** leads you further away from any immediate threats and maintains a safe position but does not interact with the box.\n- Moving **LEFT (8, 12)** would not move you toward the box or a scoring interaction.\n- Moving **RIGHT (8, 14)** moves you closer to the box at (8, 16), which is a valid target to eliminate.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nMoving **RIGHT (8, 14)** positions your avatar one step closer to the box while allowing strategic movement potential in subsequent turns.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThis action moves you to (8, 14), preparing you to potentially eliminate the box at (8, 16) on your next turn, aligning with the strategic focus on positioning and box removal."

It will be beneficial to move in that direction to interact with and eliminate the box.\n\nSince you are currently facing south and the intended action is to move right (to eliminate the box), you should perform the action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action expects the avatar to move towards the box, allowing you to continue progressing towards your objectives while managing any potential threats."
