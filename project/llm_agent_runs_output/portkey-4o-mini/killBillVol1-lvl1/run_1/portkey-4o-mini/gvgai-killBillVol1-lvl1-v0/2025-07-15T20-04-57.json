However, from the perspective of a standard representation, I'll consider the avatar possibly on the ground floor (or row 15) among significant blank spaces.\n\n### Observing the Map:\n- There are chips (indicated by `$` on row 5 and row 6) that can be collected.\n- The goal (`@`) is located at position (2, 22), which implies that traversing upward will lead toward it.\n- There are available spaces, but walls (`w`) occupy the edges, necessitating the careful movement between floor types (e.g., `A`, `e`, `.`, `h`, `d`, etc.).\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo effectively play the game:\n1. I will initially visualize the movements towards the direction of the goal while monitoring resource locations.\n2.

The objective is to reach the goal (which is at (2,22)) while collecting at least 10 gold along the way.\n2. Since we are on an empty tile (%), this might be a safe moment to explore further up or down to see if there are resources available.\n3. Moving towards the lifts and collecting any potential resources will be beneficial. \n\nGiven this analysis, choosing to move down seems favorable as it might lead to opening up more paths for exploration while avoiding any geographical traps or enemies for the moment.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down to (15,8), where there is empty ground (`.`), allowing for further exploration while keeping safe. I expect to find more options in that area to either collect resources or prepare for the next move towards the goal."

If information about the avatar's position is omitted, I cannot accurately determine what moves can be made without knowing the initial coordinates of the avatar.\n\nHowever, from the detailed map provided, we can observe that the goal (`@`) is located at coordinates (2, 22). There are numerous walls (`w`) surrounding the level, with a mix of open tiles (`.`), traps (`+`, `-`, `/`), lifts (`$`, `#`), and enemy sprites (hidden `x`, `y`, `z`). \n\nAssuming the player was at (3, 2) previously, the next strategic step would be to avoid traps and move closer to the goal. Hence, the first few actions would likely involve right or up moves towards the goal.\n\nFor now, without the avatar's position, if I had to make an action in a hypothetical scenario, I might choose a movement direction based on available paths.\n\nAssuming a position at (3, 2), my action would be:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nI chose to move left to engage with the environment and potentially find a path to collect resources while analyzing traps and enemies nearby. Expecting to re-evaluate based on further movement or interactions in the next state."

Since our immediate objective is to collect gold and reach the green door ('@'), we'll need to strategize around that goal.\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves**: I see that the avatar can potentially move either to the right or down, depending on its starting position. If the avatar\u2019s position is anywhere on the second row (row 2), it has access to numerous paths, particularly around the chips hidden and areas leading toward the goal.\n\n2. **Collect Resources**: We need to prioritize moving towards the chips identified in the scenario.

In the current map state, notable elements include:\n- Several open spaces (represented by '.') to move around.\n- A goal point located at (2, 22) represented by '@'.\n- Lifts represented by '$' located at (5, 2) and (13, 2).\n- The hidden chips which could potentially be collected for resources, although their positions need to be located.\n\n### Pathway Analysis\nFrom the position of the goal (2, 22), we can infer potential pathways through the free spaces. Based on the map, the lifts can also be strategic for reaching higher areas. The ideal strategy is to check the surrounding area for items and chains of movement toward collecting chips and reaching the goal.\n\n### Movement and Action\nSince the current avatar position is uncertain, let's assume it is at (5, 5), where there appears to be room for movement. Given the notion that movement may require multiple actions based on pending rotation, we'll move downward towards potential action by using the lift at (5, 2).\n\n**Action**: Move down to the lift first:\n\n``` Action: ACTION_DOWN ```\n\nThis action allows us to check further movement options available and potentially utilize the lift further down to collect any items nearby while focusing on ensuring our path towards the endpoint remains clear."
