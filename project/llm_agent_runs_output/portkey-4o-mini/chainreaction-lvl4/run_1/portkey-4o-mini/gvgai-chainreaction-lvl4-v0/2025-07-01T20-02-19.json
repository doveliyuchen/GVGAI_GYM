Move towards boxes and boulders to manipulate states for advancing toward the goal.\n2. Plan moves around holes ('0' and '#') to avoid penalties.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince no previous movement is registered due to initial starting state consideration, I should take an action that moves the avatar towards interaction points.

Since our initial position is well defined, we should aim to maneuver towards the goal at (2, 7) by either moving horizontally (left or right) to find an available strategy.\n\nGiven that moving directly up is blocked by a wall, moving down or laterally seems to be the best first step.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince moving left (to 7, 3) or right (to 7, 5) does not present immediate danger, I will take the action that seems most beneficial towards navigating strategically through the maze towards the goal.\n\nI will move **right** to (7, 5).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves my avatar rightward, potentially setting me up for further movement towards the goal while avoiding the hole.
