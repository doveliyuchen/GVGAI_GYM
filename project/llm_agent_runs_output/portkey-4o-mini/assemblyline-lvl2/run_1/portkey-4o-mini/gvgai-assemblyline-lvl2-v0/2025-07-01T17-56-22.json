Notably, the potato transformation has not yet taken place, indicating the necessity to locate a potato (which appears to be at (1, 2)).\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. The first step will be to move towards the potato (h) located at (1, 2) since that is essential for achieving the transformation sequence.\n2.

Move up to (11, 6) [ACTION_UP]\n  2. Move up to (10, 6) [ACTION_UP]\n  3. Move up to (9, 6) [ACTION_UP]\n  4. Move up to (8, 6) [ACTION_UP]\n  5. Move up to (7, 6) [ACTION_UP]\n  6.
