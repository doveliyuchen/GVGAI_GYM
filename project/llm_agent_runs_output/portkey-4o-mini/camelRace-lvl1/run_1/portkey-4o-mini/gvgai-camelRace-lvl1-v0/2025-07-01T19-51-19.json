The avatar can only move left, right, up, or down.\n2. The camels are currently positioned, with a random camel located at (5, 46), which is several spaces behind the avatar but still a threat given that it could move towards the goal in a timely manner.\n\n### Win Strategy:\n- The objective is to move towards the goal while avoiding encounters with the camels.\n- The avatar's current position (7, 31) is too far from the goal, and direct paths are blocked, meaning it must find a way to navigate toward column 1 in earlier rows to eventually reach the goal.\n\n### Action Plan:\nTo begin, I will move the avatar left (since the avatar is at column 31), as this is currently the only feasible direction to start positioning towards the lower columns and make progress toward the goal.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis left movement is expected to help change the avatar's position towards a more suitable trajectory to eventually reach the goal while assessing further movement options thereafter."

Reviewing the map description, we can observe:\n\n- The avatar is located at (row 4, col 40).\n- The objective (goal) is at (row 1, col 1), represent as `#`.\n- Walls (`f`) are located in multiple rows, restricting movement.\n- There are camels (`@`, `&`, `%`, etc.) in various rows, some of which might head towards the goal.\n\n### Evaluation:\n1. **Current Obstacles:** The nearby area around the avatar is primarily occupied by walls. Notably, there's a wall to the immediate left (at (row 4, col 39)), and no direct path towards the goal that doesn't face a wall.\n\n2. **Movement Strategy:** To reach the goal at (1, 1), the avatar must navigate past all walls while considering the positions and speeds of the camels. The walls make certain paths (left and immediate downward) blocked.\n\n3. **Next Action:** Since the avatar cannot move down or left due to walls, moving right (to (row 4, col 41)) seems reasonable as there appears to be open space and may provide better options for maneuvering towards the goal eventually.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should open up more potential paths for future movement while progressing towards the goal."

    "content": "The avatar's current position is unclear since the specific location of the avatar ('a') was not provided in the current state. However, based on the map layout, I recognize the goal ('#') is at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 1), which means there are several opportunities to reach the target.\n\nGiven the various positions of camels nearby and walls around, navigating carefully is essential. Since the avatar's position has not changed, I must analyze further to choose an action. \n\nNow, based on the layout where the avatar might be anywhere in the first rows, the strategic idea is to either move closer to the goal or to position oneself where a wall blocks camels from faster movement.\n\nSince the avatar's position is assumed to be aligned with the walls or pathways leading to the goal, and to ensure I'm not stuck without progress, I will take a cautious initial step in the direction of the nearest wall. \n\nGiven the horizontal wall on the left edge at (0,0) to (0,47), we will utilize the left action first, which would likely help the avatar align itself relative to the walls before proceeding further towards the goal.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nUsing the action 'left' would strategically allow repositioning away from walls if necessary, while observing the dynamics around the potential paths leading to the goal. I expect this aligns well with the strategy of proximity while managing interactions with camels effectively."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is positioned at (7, 2). The goal (green door) is located at (1, 1). Since it's crucial to prioritize reaching the goal before any camels and since wall interactions will cause the avatar to step back if it encounters a wall, I will evaluate the positions of the camels and walls nearby.\n\nI observe that there are camels in the vicinity at (1, 46), (3, 42) and (4, 42), which are relatively far from the goal right now. The walls do not appear to be blocking a direct path to the goal from your current position yet moving upwards is an immediate strategy to bring you closer to the goal.\n\nTo align with the strategy, the next action will be to move upwards since there are no immediate walls in that direction.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nI expect this action to bring the avatar closer to the goal, aligning well with the overall strategy of prioritizing map awareness and navigation efficiency."
