Moving towards them would likely lead to their transformation.\n\nGiven that the avatar is positioned as such, it is crucial to work with either citizen directly. I will take the action to move left towards citizen (12, 9), which will allow me to interact with it and possibly transform it into a blessed sprite.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action will allow my avatar to engage with the citizen on the left, aiming to transform it effectively and contribute to the win condition by maintaining the number of cursed sprites below the specified limit.

I could either move left to (12, 4) or right to (12, 6). \n\n### Action Decision:\n- **Action**: I'll move to the right (12, 6) because it allows me to stay closer to the blessed citizens and evaluate the next optimal move from there.\n\n```Action: 2```\n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy of managing citizens better by keeping them within reach for transformation or output while maintaining a safe distance from cursed interactions.
