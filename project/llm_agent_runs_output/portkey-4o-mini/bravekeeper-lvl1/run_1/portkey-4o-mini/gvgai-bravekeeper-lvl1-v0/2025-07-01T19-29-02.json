The following entities are in my immediate vicinity:\n\n- Immediate left (7, 0): wall (w)\n- Immediate right (7, 2): empty floor (.)\n- Immediate down (8, 1): empty floor (.)\n- Immediate up (6, 1): empty floor (.)\n- Additional relevant entities nearby:\n  - Down at (7, 3): a quick monster (#)\n  - The positions of boxes (@) can be found at (2, 10), (2, 16), (2, 24), (12, 10), (12, 16), and (12, 24).\n\n### Strategic Overview:\nMy immediate next moves should focus on:\n1. **Avoiding the quick monster** situated at (7, 3). As quick monsters are harder to evade, keeping my distance is critical.\n2. Considering my options, I see that moving right to (7, 2) or moving up to (6, 1) are both safe options since they lead to empty floor spaces and do not bring me closer to the quick monster at (7, 3).\n\n### Evaluation of Actions:\n1. Moving **right (to 7, 2)** keeps me in the same row away from the threat of the quick monster but does not bring me closer to the boxes.\n2. Moving **up (to 6, 1)** also keeps me safe and opens potential movement to other locations without encountering immediate dangers.\n\nGiven this assessment, I will choose to move **up to (6, 1)** to continue seeking a strategic advantage while avoiding the quick monster.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up keeps me safe from immediate threats and allows flexibility for future moves without drawing close to the quick monster. I expect this aligns well with the strategy of prioritizing safety and avoiding threats."

Based on the surroundings:\n\n- There are walls (w) around the upper parts and many empty tiles (.) present throughout the map.\n- I can see a thief to the left at (row=2, col=1) and moving to avoid direct interaction with it is crucial.\n- There are several boxes (@) located at (row=2, col=10), (row=2, col=16), and (row=2, col=24) that need to be transformed to collect points.\n\nConsidering the immediate goal of avoiding the thief while navigating toward the boxes, the safest maneuver is to move right (ACTION_RIGHT) to (row=6, col=2) instead of going left towards the thief.\n\nLet's execute the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is strategic as it will move the avatar away from the thief's line of action while progressing towards the boxes for potential score collection. I expect this action will keep me safe and in a favorable position for future moves."

The surrounding entities are as follows:\n- Directly above `(5, 2)`: monsterQuick (`#`)\n- To the left `(6, 1)`: floor (`.`)\n- To the right `(6, 3)`: floor (`.`)\n- Below `(7, 2)`: floor (`.`)\n\nConsidering the situation:\n1. I need to avoid the monsterQuick directly above me, as it poses a danger if I remain in the same row.\n2. To the left and right are empty floor spaces, providing straightforward options for movement.\n3. Downwards is also an option, but it still keeps me at risk from the monster above me.\n\nSince I must prioritize safety and avoiding the monster above, I should move either left or right. Moving left may place me closer to walls and reduce mobility options. Moving right will allow me to explore more of the board without immediately entering the threat range.\n\nThus, I will choose to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves me right into `(6, 3)` safely, allowing future opportunities to interact with surrounding boxes while avoiding the monster above. My expectation is that this aligns with my strategy of maintaining safety while maximizing my movement options."

This will prevent the monster from approaching from that direction.\n\nThus, my action will be as follows: \n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action is expected to secure a safe position next to the wall while preventing any immediate threats from the quick monsters."
