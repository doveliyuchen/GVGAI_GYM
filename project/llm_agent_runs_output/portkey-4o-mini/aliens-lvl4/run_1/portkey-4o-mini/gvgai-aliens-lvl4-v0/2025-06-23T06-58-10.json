The player needs to employ a strategy that minimizes contact with alien projectiles while targeting the aliens.\n\nFirst, let's analyze potential actions:\n1. **Moving Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: This would move the avatar to (10, 0), where there is a space (background). It does not move towards enemies.\n2. **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: This would move the avatar to (10, 2), where there is another space (background) but may lead towards alien threats above in row 0.\n3. **Using Action (ACTION_USE)**: This would typically involve shooting or using a power-up, which may not be effective if there's no enemy in immediate range.\n\nSince the avatar's position has not changed, we need to take an action that will improve our overall strategy. Moving left could create distance from aliens in the next rows up while still allowing the avatar to maneuver and possibly shoot in subsequent turns.\n\nBased on the above considerations, I will choose to move left.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action will help maintain distance from potential attacks and reposition my avatar more strategically for the next move. I expect this to align with the overall strategy of staying mobile and avoiding damage."

The avatar needs to remain mobile and find a position that allows for effective strategy against the aliens.\n2. Since going left (to (10, 1)) or right (to (10, 3)) will not yield any immediate benefit in terms of threat engagement and avoids getting close to bombs or alien encounters, it's prudent to assess upward movement.\n\nThus, to prioritize positioning and encounter potential aliens for scoring opportunities, I will choose to move **up** while assessing the future actions based on the new state after movement.\n\nExecuting this plan, I will take the left action to position closer to the center of the conflict area while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMy expectation is to rotate towards the left, preparing to either continue moving up in the next turn or engage with any threats if present."

From the map, we observe the presence of alien green enemies '@' at various locations, specifically concentrated in rows 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The key threats are the aliens and their bombs, particularly the bombs represented by '%' and '&'.\n\n### Analysis of Current Actions\n1. The avatar is currently positioned in an area towards the bottom of the map where it is relatively safe, but the immediate surroundings include bombs nearby (rows 6 and 7).\n2. Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) from this position isn't possible as it is already at the left edge (col 0).\n3. Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) could be a strategic move, potentially allowing the avatar to confront a new space with fewer immediate threats or to close in on the green aliens.\n\n### Recommended Action\nGiven there are multiple alien threats directly above but there's also ample space to the right that could give the player more options for movement and avoiding bombs while targeting aliens, I will opt for moving right.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to give me a better position and allow me to analyze further options without immediately hitting any bombs while potentially approaching the aliens for engagement."

Moving left or right will help me reposition to open spaces and avoid direct engagement with the aliens. I'm currently flanked by several 'aliens' below my position. I also need to be careful about not moving towards a bomb.\n\n### Evaluating Available Actions:\n1. **ACTION_USE (1)**: If I have ammo, using it to shoot aliens could help reduce the threat. However, I need to be in a position where I can see the aliens.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Moving left would put me in the area occupied by a bomb. This is dangerous.\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Moving right would keep me in a safer space as it leads to more open spots. \n\nGiven the situation, moving right is the most logical choice.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI will move right to ensure my avatar maintains distance from dangerous threats while seeking a better position to either attack or further retreat.
