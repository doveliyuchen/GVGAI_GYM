The suitcase (represented as `$`) is located at row=3, col=6 and row=3, col=7, suggesting that it can be sent towards the passengers when an appropriate lever is activated to create a strategic path.\n\n### Strategy Considerations\n1. **Lever Interaction**: Before making a move, it might be beneficial to manipulate the lever at (row=8, col=3) to see how it could potentially create access to the passengers. \n2. **Avatar Movement**: If the lever mechanism doesn't lead directly to an immediate win or point gain, subsequent movement options must focus on aligning the suitcase to be directed towards achievable passengers.\n3. **Avoiding Walls and Danger**: Being cautious about the positioning of entities such as death sprites, which could immediately result in score penalties. \n\n### Recommended Action\nSince we need to explore the lever interaction first to assess how best to position our suitcase and avatar for further actions, I will start with pulling the lever nearby.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action of pulling the lever to the left aims to see its immediate effect on the environment and adjust the course correctly for maximizing future passenger interactions and preventing potential penalties from wall collisions."

Your avatar is facing right and is immediately adjacent to a wall on the left and right blockage at (8,2).\n2. Moving right is necessary to reach the path towards the right of the current row where all movement is located.\n\n### Decision\nSince your avatar was just positioned right next to a lever, it is crucial to consider that it can affect the movement coordinate strategy. Given this analysis, I will perform the following action.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nFeedback: Moving right allows the avatar to continue navigating towards the vicinity of the nearest passenger while avoiding walls and analyzing further options with the levers in the next move. I expect this move to prevent any stagnation while creating a path for future movement towards the 'l'."
