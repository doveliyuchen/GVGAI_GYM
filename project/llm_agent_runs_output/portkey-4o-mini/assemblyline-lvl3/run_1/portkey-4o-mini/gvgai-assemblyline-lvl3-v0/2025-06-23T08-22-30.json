Here's a brief analysis of the immediate surroundings relevant to the objectives:\n\n1. **Nearby Potatoes**: There are several potato sprites ('j') located nearby at (10, 3) to (10, 10) and also at (11, 11) and below that line at (12, 8) and (12, 22) indicating there are potential items to collect.\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal sprite ('g') is located at (1, 8). The task is to eventually create and deliver a 'potatofull' item to this location.\n3. **Transformations Needed**: To create a 'potatofull', the following transformations must occur in sequence from potatoes:\n   - potato -> potatoeyes (interact with required assembly)\n   - potatoeyes -> potatoeyesnose (interact with required assembly)\n   - potatoeyesnose -> potatofull (interact with required assembly)\n\nGiven the layout, there is an assembly (@) at (3, 15) that could possibly be used for transformations if I can reach it. The avatar should prioritize collecting and transforming potatoes while managing hazards.\n\nSince the avatar position has not changed and there are plenty of potatoes available, the best immediate action is to start collecting potatoes:\n\nAs such, I will move to the right (since there are potatoes directly to the right at (10,3) and I should try to collect them).\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of prioritizing potato collection to start the process of creating the 'potatofull'. I expect to see the avatar collect more potatoes and possibly extend towards the assembly for further transformations on subsequent moves."

This requires collecting potatoes and transforming them through a chain of production to finally deliver them to the goal.\n\n### Next Steps\nMy immediate goals are:\n- Move towards collecting potatoes while keeping in mind that I need to perform transformations to achieve 'potatofull'.\n- Observe the layout from the avatar's current position and identify routes without hitting hazards.\n  \nUsing two available potatoes at nearby locations (the closest being one at (1, 11)), I can move towards an item collection or transformation.\n\nUpon checking the possible moves:\n- I can move **Up** from (12, 2) to (11, 2) (this is empty space).\n- **Left** isn't immediately advantageous since it may lead toward walls and obstacles.\n\nI will move **UP** (to 11, 2) to progress toward gathering the necessary items:\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action keeps me in a safe zone while moving towards my goal of collecting potatoes."
