The first ingredient to collect is flour (#) located at (1, 4).\n\nYour current position at (5, 9) allows movement options:\n- Up (4, 9) (free space: .)\n- Down (6, 9) (free space: .)\n- Left (5, 8) (free space: .)\n- Right (5, 10) (free space: .)\n\n### Action Selection\nTo navigate towards the flour while minimizing the threat from the chefs, moving up would be strategic as it also keeps the avatar away from obstacles and opens more vertical movement options.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should allow movement to a safer position and bring you closer to the resources you need to collect, executing the plan of resource collection while maintaining distance from the enemy."

To reach this ingredient, you will need to navigate through the obstacles (floor, walls, and tables).\n\nConsidering your current position (4, 9) and the position of the chef (they are located at multiple positions, primarily around row 2 and row 3), the safest first action is to move upwards as it's clear of immediate danger (the chef appears to be up as well). The route feels strategic as it may provide a more extensive pathway since the chef's path configuration in the lower rows may block off routes to resources.\n\nThus, the action taken here is to move upward:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis chosen action is anticipated to position your avatar closer to the top of the map where the egg resource is located, while maintaining distance from the chef.
