Therefore, we should prioritize moving towards (12, 12) to collect the key first.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: We need to carefully navigate surroundings to avoid fireholes and traps.\n3. **Direct Path**: The most straightforward movement to the key from our current position would be to go down (to (11, 10)) and then to the right (to (12, 11)).\n\n### Immediate Action\nThe best move right now is to move **down** to (11, 10).\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nI expect this action will allow me to approach the key while ensuring I have a clearer path to the exit afterwards."

The avatar can move **RIGHT** to `(10, 11)`, which is also free space.\n\n### Best Action\nSince our immediate objective is to reach the key at `(12, 12)`, moving down (to `(11, 10)`) is blocked by a wall. However, moving `UP` to `(9, 10)` or `LEFT` to `(10, 9)` keeps us on an unobstructed path, but we cannot reach the key directly from those locations. \n\nTo efficiently navigate towards the key and subsequently the exit, the best course of action would be to move **UP** to `(9, 10)`, which will then allow us to eventually move towards the key.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, I will take the action to move **UP**:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action is strategically sound as it keeps our movement options open for the next turn while heading closer to the goal of collecting the key."

Thus, we will choose:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nFeedback: Moving down brings me nearer to the key, which is crucial for continuing toward the exit while also collecting necessary resources.
