The immediate strategy should focus on resource collection and positioning to either avoid confrontation with enemies or prep for interactions that might yield resources without unnecessary risk.\n2. Given that the avatar's position has not changed (if that were the case), I should avoid repeating the same action and instead focus on movement to maximize resource collection.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nI will move **UP** (to row 5, column 7) to explore above and potentially find resources or a clearer path.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will allow for further exploration and to potentially find resources while keeping the avatar safe from immediate threat, aligning with the strategy of resource management and positioning."
