The goal is located at (1, 1), with multiple boxes ('@') situated around in row 8 and row 4.\n\nThe interactions noted in the mechanics suggest that the player must be careful about hazardous sprites like water ('.') which can harm the avatar and must also navigate the environment effectively, utilizing bombs if available to manage box obstacles.\n\nGiven the current position and to implement effective movement, let\u2019s analyze potential actions:\n- The avatar can potentially move right, left, up, or down from its current position.\n- Notably, the direct path to the goal may require navigating around boxes and other characters.\n\nWith the current position being (8, 3) and the availability of boxes to manipulate, I will explore the surrounding area by moving **up** towards (7, 3):\n``` Action: 5 ```\nBy moving up, I expect to gain better visibility of the layout ahead while also potentially finding a path towards the goal. This action aligns with the strategy of exploring the area further."
