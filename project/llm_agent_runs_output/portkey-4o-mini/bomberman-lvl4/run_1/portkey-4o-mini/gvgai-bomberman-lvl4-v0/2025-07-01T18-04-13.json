Moving UP (to (1, 5)) is a potential next step, or you could engage with a bomb to create more movement options.\n\nI will choose to move UP to explore potential routes towards the goal.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nMoving UP should allow for more engagement with the environment and potential paths towards the goal.
