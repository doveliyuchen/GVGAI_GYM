I should consider using a bomb in that location to clear the path since it leads toward the green door.\n2. **Enemy Avoidance**: I must be mindful of the bat approaching from its randomized path towards (1, 15).\n\n### Decision:\nSince my avatar's position was just confirmed as (3, 5) and there are walls to the left and right, I will take the action to use a bomb at the position next to me to clear the wallBreak leading towards the goal.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this will create a path toward the green door and reveal any potential enemies in the area.
