The avatar does not currently have the key (it is in the nokey state).\n2. The goal cannot be accessed without the key.\n3. The avatar is surrounded by walls and has a clear path to the key.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The immediate goal is to collect the key first, as it is essential for reaching the goal.\n- The avatar can move towards the key without encountering any enemies directly in the next move.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe avatar can move right to (7, 3) to get closer to the key. This position is clear and allows for further movement towards the key in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar right, bringing it closer to the key, which aligns with the strategy of collecting the key first to access the goal."
