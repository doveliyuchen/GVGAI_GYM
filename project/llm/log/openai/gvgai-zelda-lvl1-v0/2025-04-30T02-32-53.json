Both could pose a threat depending on the avatar\u2019s moves.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven that the avatar currently does not have the key, the immediate focus should be on navigating towards the key. Since the wall to the left (6, 1) and above (7, 1) block the avatar's movement, and moving down (to (8, 1)) does not take the avatar closer to the key, the best action is to move right (to (7, 2)).

The avatar is at (7, 2) and needs to navigate upward through the level.\n2. The key is located at (5, 9), which is two rows above the avatar, but the avatar must go through various paths due to walls (`w`) that block direct access.\n3.

The nearest safe path leads right through the wall layout and upwards towards the goal; thus, movement should be strategic to avoid getting blocked.\n\n### Strategy Implementation\nFollowing the previous strategies:\n1. First, the avatar should try to move right to position itself better for an upward movement towards the key.\n2. If a direction leads to no movement (due to walls), I will analyze further to adjust the approach.\n\nGiven the layout, I will first attempt to move to the right (Action 3).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to reposition the avatar, potentially allowing access to new routes or direct movement upward towards important objectives like the key or the goal in future turns."

The goal (door '@') is at (1, 4) and the key '#' is at (5, 9). \n\nI need to collect the key before I can reach the goal. The closest path to the key appears to require moving left to (7, 2) where the quick monster ('%') is located. However, since it's a monster, I can engage it since I am currently 'nokey' (no key). \n\n1. I should first move left to (7, 2) to engage the quick monster. Though this action could lead to my avatar being harmed, if I defeat the quick monster, I will gain points which could help in the long run.\n\nGiven that my current logic suggests a move towards the monster, I will proceed with action `2` (move left).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is aimed at engaging with the nearby monster, and I expect that if I defeat it, I may either score points or clear my path to the key."

The immediate goal is to collect the key represented by `#`, which is located on the same row but to the right. Additionally, the avatar must avoid enemies and walls.\n\nTo successfully collect the key, the next logical move is to move right, as it places you directly adjacent to the key without the risk of encountering an enemy immediately.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should lead to collecting the key, transforming from `nokey` to `withkey`, and sets the player up to progress towards the goal (door)."
