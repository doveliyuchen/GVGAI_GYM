The avatar needs to collect the key (`#`) to transform from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" to access the goal (`@`).\n2. The avatar must avoid the enemies, especially the monsterSlow (`&`) which is directly above the avatar, as it can defeat the avatar if they come into contact.\n\n### Available Actions\nGiven the current state, the avatar can take the following actions:\n- **Move Up**: This would result in the avatar moving into the monsterSlow (`&`), which is a loss condition.\n- **Move Down**: This would move the avatar to an empty space (`.`), but does not progress towards the goal or key.\n- **Move Left**: This would move the avatar into a wall (`w`), which is not allowed.\n- **Move Right**: This would move the avatar to an empty space (`.`), but again does not progress towards the goal or key.\n- **Use Action**: This action is not applicable since there is no item to use at the moment.\n\n### Best Action\nThe best action in this scenario is to **move down** to avoid the enemy above and stay safe while looking for a path to the key. \n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to move down safely, avoiding the enemy and keeping options open for the next turn. I expect to see the avatar in a safer position, ready to plan the next move towards the key."

The avatar needs to collect the key to transform from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" to access the goal.\n2. The avatar should avoid the enemies, especially since one is a monsterSlow, which can be dangerous if approached.\n3. The immediate goal is to move towards the key while avoiding the enemy.\n\n### Possible Actions\nGiven the avatar's current position and the layout:\n- **Left (2)**: Moves to (1, 5), which is a floor tile ('.').\n- **Right (3)**: Moves to (1, 7), which is also a floor tile ('.').\n- **Up (5)**: Moves to (0, 6), which is a wall ('w').\n- **Down (4)**: Moves to (2, 6), which is a monsterQuick ('%').\n- **NIL (0)**: No action.\n\n### Best Action\nThe best action is to move **left (2)** to (1, 5), which is a safe floor tile. This keeps the avatar away from the enemies and allows for further movement towards the key in the next turn.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to safely navigate towards the key while avoiding immediate threats from the enemies. I expect to see the avatar positioned at (1, 5) in the next state, allowing for further strategic movement towards the key."
