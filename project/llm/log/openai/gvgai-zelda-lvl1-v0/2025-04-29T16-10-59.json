However, moving towards the key will require careful navigation, especially since I need to avoid enemies. The quickest way to reach the key is to move to (7, 6) first, as it doesn't lead me into immediate danger from the surrounding enemies.\n\nI will choose to move right.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this move to keep me safe while positioning myself better to continue towards the key."

    "content": "Given the current state, I can observe the following important details:\n\n- My avatar sprite ('*') is located at (row 7, col 9). \n- There is a key ('#') at (row 5, col 9) and the goal ('b') at (row 1, col 4). \n- There are also enemies: a quick monster ('%') at (row 5, col 1) and a slow monster ('&') at (row 5, col 3).\n\n### Analysis of the State:\n1. To reach the goal, I will need to collect the key first, since I am currently represented as 'nokey' (*).\n2. The key is directly above my current position (row 5, col 9), meaning I can move up to collect it easily.\n3. After obtaining the key, I can then proceed to navigate towards the goal.\n\n### Available Actions:\nThe possible actions from my current position are:\n- Up (to row 6, col 9)\n- Down (to row 8, col 9)\n- Left (to row 7, col 8)\n- Right (to row 7, col 10)\n- No action (which would not change the state)\n\n### Selected Action:\nSince the key is directly above my position, I will move up to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should allow me to collect the key and transform my sprite from 'nokey' to 'withkey', aligning perfectly with the strategy of first obtaining the key before attempting to reach the goal."
