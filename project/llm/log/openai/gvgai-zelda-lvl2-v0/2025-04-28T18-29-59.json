However, the avatar is currently surrounded by enemies, which poses a risk.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **ACTION_USE**: This action is not applicable since there is no item to use.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT**: Move to (4, 2), which is a floor tile ('.').\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT**: Move to (4, 4), which is a floor tile ('.').\n4. **ACTION_DOWN**: Move to (5, 3), which is occupied by a monsterSlow ('&').\n5. **ACTION_UP**: Move to (3, 3), which is a wall ('w').\n\n### Best Action:\nThe best action is to move **left** to (4, 2).
