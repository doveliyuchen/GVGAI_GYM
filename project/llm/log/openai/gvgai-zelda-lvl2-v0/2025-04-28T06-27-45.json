The avatar can move left to (5, 4) or down to (6, 5) to avoid the monster while still aiming to collect the key in the next turn.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the avatar is currently at (5, 5), moving down to (6, 5) keeps the avatar safe from the quick monster while still allowing access to the key in the next turn.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down, avoiding immediate danger and positioning for the next turn to collect the key.
