It is adjacent to a sword ('d') at row=8, col=18, which means the player can use the sword to destroy dirt blocks or attack enemies.\n\n2. **Immediate Threats**: \n   - There is a butterfly ('#') at row=8, col=12, which could harm the player if it moves closer.\n   - A boulder ('@') is at row=8, col=21, which could fall and crush the player if the dirt supporting it is destroyed.\n\n3. **Diamonds**: There are diamonds ('%') scattered around, but the closest one is at row=7, col=23-24. The player needs at least 10 diamonds to exit.\n\n4. **Exit Door**: The exit door ('*') is at row=2, col=16, but the player is far from it and doesn't have enough diamonds yet.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:1 ```  \nUse the sword to destroy the dirt block at row=8, col=18 (to the right of the avatar).
