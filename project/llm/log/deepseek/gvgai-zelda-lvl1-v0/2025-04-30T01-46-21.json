This means the player has already picked up the key and is now in possession of it (`withkey` state).\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (green door `@`) is at (row=1, col=4).\n3. **Enemies**:\n   - Quick monster (`%`) at (row=1, col=10).\n   - Normal monster (`$`) at (row=6, col=1).\n   - Slow monster (`&`) at (row=5, col=2).\n4. **Walls**: The maze is surrounded by walls (`w`), and there are internal walls blocking direct paths.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\n- Since the avatar already has the key (`withkey`), the immediate goal is to reach the green door (`@`) at (row=1, col=4).\n- The path to the door is not straightforward due to walls and enemies. We need to navigate carefully to avoid enemies (which reduce score and can kill the avatar).\n- The quick monster (`%`) is near the goal, so we must approach cautiously.\n\n### Path Planning:\nFrom (row=5, col=9) to (row=1, col=4):\n1. Move **up** to (row=4, col=9) \u2013 blocked by wall (`w`).\n2. Move **left** to (row=5, col=8) \u2013 wall (`w`).\n3. Move **right** to (row=5, col=10) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n4. From (row=5, col=10), move **up** to (row=4, col=10) \u2013 wall (`w`).\n5. From (row=5, col=10), move **right** to (row=5, col=11) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n6. From (row=5, col=11), move **up** to (row=4, col=11) \u2013 wall (`w`).\n7. From (row=5, col=11), move **right** to (row=5, col=12) \u2013 wall (`w`).\n8. Alternative: From (row=5, col=9), move **down** to (row=6, col=9) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n   - Then move **left** to (row=6, col=8) \u2013 wall (`w`).\n   - Then move **right** to (row=6, col=10) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n   - Then move **up** to (row=5, col=10) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n\nThis seems convoluted, so let's try another approach:\n- From (row=5, col=9), move **left** to (row=5, col=8) \u2013 wall (`w`).

Not possible.\n  - Then move **right** to (row=5, col=11) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n    - Then move **up** to (row=4, col=11) \u2013 wall (`w`). Not possible.\n    - Then move **right** to (row=5, col=12) \u2013 wall (`w`). Not possible.\n    - Then move **down** to (row=6, col=11) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n      - Then move **left** to (row=6, col=10) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n        - Then move **left** to (row=6, col=9) \u2013 possible (floor `.`).\n          - Then move **up** to (row=5, col=9) \u2013 back to start. Dead end.\n\n### Optimal Path:\nThe only viable immediate move is **right** to (row=5, col=10). From there, we can reassess. The quick monster (`%`) is at (row=1, col=10), which is far enough to not be an immediate threat.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove **right** to (row=5, col=10). This opens up further options to navigate toward the goal while avoiding walls and enemies.  \n\n**Feedback**: Moving right should position the avatar closer to the goal while avoiding immediate threats.

This is a bit confusing, but based on the mapping, `c` is `goal monsterSlow`, which implies the goal is at that position with a slow monster nearby.\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A quick monster (`%`) is at (row=3, col=2).\n   - A normal monster (`$`) is at (row=5, col=4).\n   - A slow monster is likely part of the `c` tile at the goal.\n4. **Walls**: The maze is surrounded by walls, with some internal walls blocking paths.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- The player already has the key (`withkey`), so the next step is to reach the goal (`c` at row=1, col=4) to win.\n- The path to the goal is not straightforward due to walls and enemies.

Move **left** to (row=5, col=8) - but this is a wall (`w`), so this is not possible.\n2. Move **up** to (row=4, col=9) - this is a wall (`w`), so not possible.\n3.

This means the avatar already has the key and is near the goal (`g` or `@`). \n\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (`g` or `@`) is at row=1, col=4 in the original state (represented as `c` due to overlapping with a monsterSlow). However, the `c` tile is a combination of `goal` and `monsterSlow`, which is unusual. The pure goal (`g`) might be elsewhere, but based on the mapping, `g` is the floor goal. The `b` (withkey) is at row=5, col=9, and the goal is nearby at row=1, col=4 (original state).\n\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - `%` (monsterQuick) at row=4, col=3 (original state).\n   - `$` (monsterNormal) at row=5, col=7 (original state).\n   - `c` (monsterSlow + goal) at row=1, col=4 (original state).\n\n4. **Path to Goal**: \n   - From `b` (row=5, col=9), the avatar needs to move upward (UP) to reach the goal at row=1, col=4. However, there are walls (`w`) and enemies in the way.\n   - The immediate path upward is blocked by a wall at row=4, col=8-11.

This means you already have the key (orange `'+'`) and can now head to the goal (green `'@'`).\n\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (`'@'`) is at `(row=1, col=4)`.\n\n3. **Enemies**:\n   - A quick monster (`'%'`) is at `(row=7, col=1)`.\n   - A normal monster (`'$'`) is at `(row=5, col=1)`.\n   - A slow monster (`'&'`) is at `(row=1, col=1)`.\n\n4. **Walls**: There are walls (`'w'`) blocking some paths, so you need to navigate around them.\n\n### Path to Goal:\nFrom `(5,9)` to `(1,4)`:\n- Move **UP** to `(4,9)` (but there's a wall at `(4,8)` and `(4,9)`, so this is blocked).\n- Move **LEFT** to `(5,8)` (wall at `(5,8)`, blocked).\n- Move **DOWN** to `(6,9)` (open).\n- Then move **LEFT** to `(6,8)` (wall at `(6,8)`, blocked).\n- Alternative: From `(5,9)`, move **RIGHT** to `(5,10)` (open), then **UP** to `(4,10)` (wall at `(4,10)`, blocked.\n- Best path: From `(5,9)`, move **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, then **LEFT** to `(6,8)` (wall), but this seems blocked. \n\nWait, the rotated state shows `(5,9)` is `'b'`, and `(6,9)` is `'.'` (floor). From `(6,9)`, you can move **LEFT** to `(6,8)` (wall), but `(6,7)` is open. \n\nThis seems convoluted. Let me re-examine the original state for clarity.\n\n### Original State Layout:\n```\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw&..@w......w\nw..www......w\nw...........w\nw.......wwwww\nw$......wb..w\nw...w...w...w\nw%..w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n```\n- Avatar (`'b'`) is at `(5,9)`.\n- Goal (`'@'`) is at `(1,4)`.\n- Path:\n  - Move **UP** to `(4,9)` (wall at `(4,8)` and `(4,9)`), blocked.\n  - Move **LEFT** to `(5,8)` (wall), blocked.\n  - Move **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, then **LEFT** to `(6,8)` (wall), blocked.\n  - Move **RIGHT** to `(5,10)`, then **UP** to `(4,10)` (wall), blocked.\n  - Alternative: From `(5,9)`, move **LEFT** twice to `(5,7)` (but `(5,8)` is wall), no.\n  - From `(5,9)`, move **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, then **LEFT** to `(6,7)`, then **UP** to `(5,7)`, then **LEFT** to `(5,6)`, then **UP** to `(4,6)`, then **LEFT** to `(4,5)` (wall), no.\n  - From `(5,9)`, move **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, then **RIGHT** to `(6,10)`, then **UP** to `(5,10)`, then **LEFT** to `(5,9)` (loop).\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Maybe the goal is unreachable from this position, or I'm missing something. \n\n### Re-evaluating:\nThe rotated state shows `(5,9)` is `'b'` (avatar with key). The goal is at `(1,4)`. The path seems blocked by walls. Perhaps the intended path is:\n1. Move **LEFT** from `(5,9)` to `(5,8)` (wall), but this is blocked.\n2. Move **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, then **LEFT** to `(6,8)` (wall), blocked.\n3. Move **RIGHT** to `(5,10)`, then **UP** to `(4,10)` (wall), blocked.\n\nThis suggests the avatar is trapped. The only possible move is **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, but this doesn't help reach the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe avatar seems stuck in a position where the goal is unreachable due to walls. The only possible action is to move **DOWN** to `(6,9)`, but this doesn't progress toward the goal. \n\n``` Action:4 ```  \nMove DOWN to `(6,9)` to explore further, though the goal seems blocked.

This means the player has already picked up the key (since it's `withkey`).\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (`g` or `@`) is at (row=1, col=4) (represented as `c` in the original state, which is a `goal monsterSlow` combo). However, the pure goal is likely the `g` in the original state at (row=1, col=4).\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A quick monster (`%`) is at (row=7, col=1).\n   - A normal monster (`$`) is at (row=3, col=4).\n   - A slow monster (part of `c` at (row=1, col=4)) is near the goal.\n4. **Walls**: The maze is surrounded by walls, with some internal walls blocking paths.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\n- Since the player already has the key (`withkey`), the next step is to reach the goal (`g` or `@`) at (row=1, col=4).\n- The path to the goal is not straightforward due to walls and enemies. Here's a possible route:\n  1. Move left from (5,9) to (5,8) (but (5,8) is a wall, so this is invalid).\n  2. Move up from (5,9) to (4,9) (but (4,9) is a wall).\n  3. Move right from (5,9) to (5,10) (valid, empty floor).\n  4. From (5,10), move up to (4,10) (but (4,10) is a wall).\n  5. From (5,10), move right to (5,11) (valid, empty floor).\n  6. From (5,11), move up to (4,11) (wall), so not possible.\n  7. From (5,11), move right to (5,12) (wall).\n  8. Alternative: From (5,9), move down to (6,9) (valid, empty floor).\n  9. From (6,9), move left to (6,8) (wall).\n  10. From (6,9), move down to (7,9) (valid, empty floor).\n  11. From (7,9), move left to (7,8) (valid, empty floor).\n  12. Continue left to (7,7), (7,6), etc., then up toward the goal.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nFrom (5,9), the only viable immediate move is **right** to (5,10). This opens up more options for future moves toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove RIGHT to (5,10) to open up a path toward the goal while avoiding walls.

This means you have already picked up the key and can now open the goal (green door `@`).\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (`@`) is at (row=1, col=4).\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A quick monster (`%`) is at (row=1, col=8).\n   - A normal monster (`$`) is at (row=3, col=2).\n   - A slow monster (`&`) is at (row=4, col=2).\n4. **Walls**: Walls (`w`) block movement, so you must navigate around them.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\n- Since you already have the key (`withkey`), the priority is to reach the goal (`@`) at (row=1, col=4) without getting killed by enemies.\n- The path to the goal is not straightforward due to walls and enemies. Here's a possible route:\n  1. Move **left** from (5,9) to (5,8) (but (5,8) is a wall, so this is invalid).\n  2. Move **up** from (5,9) to (4,9) (but (4,9) is a wall).\n  3. Move **right** from (5,9) to (5,10) (empty floor `.`).\n  4. From (5,10), you can move **up** to (4,10) (wall) or **right** to (5,11) (empty floor `.`).\n  5.

Better path: From (row=5, col=9), move **DOWN** to (row=6, col=9) \u2013 floor (`.`), then **LEFT** to (row=6, col=8) \u2013 wall (`w`), invalid.\n  7.

Then **UP** to (row=4, col=11) \u2013 wall, invalid.\nThis isn't working. \n\n### Correct Path:\nLooking at the map, the only viable path is:\n1. Move **DOWN** to (row=6, col=9).\n2.

Then **UP** to (row=6, col=9) \u2013 back to start.\nThis is a loop. \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe avatar seems trapped in a small area with no clear path to the goal.

The best immediate move is to go left to (5,8), but since that's a wall, we need to find another way.\n- Alternative path: From (5,9), move up to (4,9) is blocked by a wall. The only viable immediate move is right to (5,10), then up to (4,10), but (4,10) is a wall. This seems like a dead end.\n- Re-evaluating: The avatar might be stuck in a corner. The best action is to try to move away from the wall and toward the goal, even if it means taking a longer path.\n\n### Action:\nGiven the current position and walls, the best immediate action is to move **right** to (5,10) to free up space and then plan further moves toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```  \n*Move right to free the avatar from the corner and open up movement options toward the goal.*"
