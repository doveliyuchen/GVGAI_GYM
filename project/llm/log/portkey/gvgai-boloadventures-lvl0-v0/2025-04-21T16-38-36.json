    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules, sprites, interactions, and level layout, I can derive the following analysis regarding the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and suggest a strategic approach.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game can be classified under the **puzzle-adventure** genre. This is indicated by the presence of strategic placements of sprites (blocks, boulders, lasers) and obstacles (walls, holes) that require players to think carefully to navigate through the level and achieve their objectives.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:** The game has various sprites with specific functionalities:\n   - **Avatar (player character):** Can interact with other sprites (e.g., boulders, walls, lasers).\n   - **Passive and Missile objects:** Include boxes and boulders that interact with the avatar and the environment.\n   - **Immovable objects:** Such as walls and goals, which provide boundaries and targets.\n   - **Laser cannons:** These act as traps that can damage the player if not navigated carefully.\n\n2. **Interactions:** There are defined interactions among the different sprite types:\n   - The avatar can be harmed by lasers unless using a box to shield itself.\n   - Boulders can transform into a missile form upon specific interactions, which can affect other nearby sprites.\n   - Various sprites can cause score changes, and the removal or transformation of sprites can significantly change game dynamics.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends with a win condition if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5.\n   - The game will end with a loss if the avatar is destroyed, as indicated by the SpriteCounter reaching zero.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the goal sprite while avoiding obstacles, traps (like lasers and falls into holes), and leveraging environmental elements (boxes and boulders) strategically for protection and maneuvering.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal sprite while collecting points, achieving a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar is killed by lasers or through interactions with other lethal objects, leading to loss of all avatars.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Use of Boxes for Protection:** The player should utilize boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks. Positioning can be critical; arranging boxes can help in navigating through laser cannons safely.\n\n2. **Boulder Manipulation:** Players can interact with boulders strategically to either block pathways or clear out space as necessary. Triggering the transformation of a boulder to a missile may also create potential traps for enemies or clear out obstacles in their way.\n\n3. **Movement Planning:** The player needs to carefully plan movements to avoid collisions with walls and falls into holes while considering the rotational or directional mechanics of the laser cannons.\n\n4. **Score Consideration:** Each interaction can affect the score; aim for maximizing score while reaching the goal, which may require exploring different paths or solving small puzzles that allow the player to achieve extra points before heading to the goal.\n\n5. **Trial and Error with Interactions:** Given that some interactions can greatly alter the state of the game state (feel free to experiment with pushing boulders, moving boxes, and seeing how lasers can influence the path), this exploration can lead to alternative solutions or shortcuts.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game presents a mix of strategic puzzle-solving with elements of adventure, requiring careful planning, interaction manipulation, and a bit of trial-and-error to navigate its levels successfully. A strong focus on using the environment creatively and managing risks associated with the lethal traps will be key to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.
