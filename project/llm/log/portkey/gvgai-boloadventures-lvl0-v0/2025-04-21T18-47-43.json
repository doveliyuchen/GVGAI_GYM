The presence of immovable obstacles, collectible score items, and interactions between various sprites indicates a strong emphasis on problem-solving and tactical movement rather than standard combat or exploration mechanics.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The sprites define the game\u2019s environment and entities, such as the player (avatar), obstacles (walls and boulders), hazards (lasers), and goals. There are different interaction types, such as collision reactions (bounce back, transforms), which affect gameplay dynamics.\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - Certain interactions result in the transformation of sprites (e.g., the transformation of the boulder into a boulderm when the avatar collides).\n   - There are mechanisms for killing (removing) sprites, particularly the avatar when in contact with laser beams or holes.\n   - Walls and boxes provide protective actions (shielding from lasers) or movement consequences (bouncing back).\n\n3. **Laser Cannons**: The introduction of laser cannons adds a layer of challenge. Players must navigate around them while avoiding the lasers that can kill the avatar.\n  \n4. **Score**: There\u2019s a scoring system where players can gain points from specific interactions (like interacting with the goal or killing enemies).\n\n#### Objective\nThe game's primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal while managing hazards and interactions effectively. Meeting the win condition requires reaching the goal (which yields a point score) while avoiding death from various sources like walls or lasers.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar successfully reaches the goal, indicated by \"killSprite\" and a score increment.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's count reaches zero; this occurs when the avatar is killed by hazards like lasers, holes, or other lethal interactions.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Carefully plan your movement through the level to avoid impending threats from boulders and lasers. Analyze the layout thoroughly to find safe paths.\n\n2. **Utilizing Obstacles**: Use boxes as shields against frontal laser shots and to bounce back safely when interacting. Strategically maneuver around them to safeguard the avatar.\n\n3. **Boulders Management**: Use boulders to manipulate the environment, potentially eliminating threats by moving them into holes where they could kill other sprites. \n\n4. **Avoiding Hazards**: Stay aware of laser cannons and their firing directions. Time your movements so that you're not caught in a beam while traversing the area.\n\n5. **Leveraging Score Opportunities**: Actively look for interactions that can yield points, primarily through the goal or defeating certain sprites. This can improve overall performance in the game.\n\n6. **Retreating**: If faced with an immediate threat (like a laser or bouncing boulder), retreat to a safe position or backtrack to reassess the situation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game presents a strategic puzzle platformer where players must think critically about their moves, interact with the environment wisely, and avoid hazards to achieve their goal. Each interaction has a consequence that significantly affects the game dynamics, requiring careful planning and foresight.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The presence of immovable obstacles, collectible score items, and interactions between various sprites indicates a strong emphasis on problem-solving and tactical movement rather than standard combat or exploration mechanics.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The sprites define the game\u2019s environment and entities, such as the player (avatar), obstacles (walls and boulders), hazards (lasers), and goals. There are different interaction types, such as collision reactions (bounce back, transforms), which affect gameplay dynamics.\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - Certain interactions result in the transformation of sprites (e.g., the transformation of the boulder into a boulderm when the avatar collides).\n   - There are mechanisms for killing (removing) sprites, particularly the avatar when in contact with laser beams or holes.\n   - Walls and boxes provide protective actions (shielding from lasers) or movement consequences (bouncing back).\n\n3. **Laser Cannons**: The introduction of laser cannons adds a layer of challenge. Players must navigate around them while avoiding the lasers that can kill the avatar.\n  \n4. **Score**: There\u2019s a scoring system where players can gain points from specific interactions (like interacting with the goal or killing enemies).\n\n#### Objective\nThe game's primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal while managing hazards and interactions effectively. Meeting the win condition requires reaching the goal (which yields a point score) while avoiding death from various sources like walls or lasers.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar successfully reaches the goal, indicated by \"killSprite\" and a score increment.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's count reaches zero; this occurs when the avatar is killed by hazards like lasers, holes, or other lethal interactions.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Carefully plan your movement through the level to avoid impending threats from boulders and lasers. Analyze the layout thoroughly to find safe paths.\n\n2. **Utilizing Obstacles**: Use boxes as shields against frontal laser shots and to bounce back safely when interacting. Strategically maneuver around them to safeguard the avatar.\n\n3. **Boulders Management**: Use boulders to manipulate the environment, potentially eliminating threats by moving them into holes where they could kill other sprites. \n\n4. **Avoiding Hazards**: Stay aware of laser cannons and their firing directions. Time your movements so that you're not caught in a beam while traversing the area.\n\n5. **Leveraging Score Opportunities**: Actively look for interactions that can yield points, primarily through the goal or defeating certain sprites. This can improve overall performance in the game.\n\n6. **Retreating**: If faced with an immediate threat (like a laser or bouncing boulder), retreat to a safe position or backtrack to reassess the situation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game presents a strategic puzzle platformer where players must think critically about their moves, interact with the environment wisely, and avoid hazards to achieve their goal. Each interaction has a consequence that significantly affects the game dynamics, requiring careful planning and foresight.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.
