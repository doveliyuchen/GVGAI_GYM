The player navigates through a maze-like environment while manipulating objects and avoiding hazards in a quest to reach a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n  - **Ground**: A stationary element that serves as the playable area.\n  - **Hole**: A hazard that can kill the player (avatar) upon contact.\n  - **Goal**: The win condition; reaching this sprite rewards points and concludes the game.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character; interacts with other sprites to progress through the level.\n  - **Boxes and Boulders**: These can be moved or used to shield against hazards (like lasers).\n  - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Act as offensive hazards; the avatar must avoid them to survive.\n  - **Walls**: Obstacles that the player cannot pass through.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The interactions between the avatar, boulders, boxes, and hazards dictate game strategies.\n  - Certain interactions allow the player to block lasers (if there's a box in between), while others result in player movement backward or transformation into another state.\n  - Contact with certain elements like holes and lasers can lead to instant death, while reaching the goal will grant points and lead to a win condition if the player isn't dead.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards. The player must manage the interactions between the avatar, other objects (boxes, boulders), and hazards (lasers) effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also grants points.\n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - If the avatar counter reaches zero, the game concludes with a loss.\n  - Contact with specific hazards, like lasers in a frontal position or falling into a hole, will also lead to a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Carefully Analyze the Environment**: Before making any moves, evaluate the positioning of walls, hazards, and the goal. Understanding the layout can prevent unnecessary deaths.\n\n2. **Use Boxes for Protection**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from laser fire. Ensure strategic placement to create barriers between the avatar and any pressing hazards.\n\n3. **Manage Movements**: Avoid engaging with boulders head-on since these can push the avatar back or lead to transformation into a boulderm, which might restrict your options.\n\n4. **Plan the Path to the Goal**: Since there's a score system based on reaching the goal, always navigate towards it while being mindful of traps and hazards. The score affects the overall game outcome, so maximize points whilst minimizing risk.\n\n5. **Create Safe Zones**: Use boxes to block dangerous elements temporarily, creating a safe zone to plan your next moves.\n\n6. **Learn from Hazards**: Each failed attempt provides insight into the hazard's area of influence. Use this knowledge to devise a safer route in subsequent attempts.\n\n7. **Avoid Frontal Contact with Lasers and Holes**: Keep an eye on the avatar's positioning relative to danger zones, adjusting accordingly to avoid instant game over.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can methodically navigate through levels, overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving the goal while avoiding losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

If it does, the player should reconsider either blocking a different hazard or addressing a more immediate danger.\n\n- **Interact with the Nearest Item**: If the boulder cannot be pushed due to it being blocked or other factors, assess the proximity and relevance of the **box (#)**. It may provide additional utility for creating barriers or safe zones.\n\n### Next Step:\n\nOnce the boulder is pushed successfully or evaluating whether that action is feasible, the next overarching strategy should be to **Utilize the Box to Block Holes or Hazards** or **Continue Manipulating the Boulder** to create a secure route toward the goal ($). This ensures the player is both advancing towards the objective and minimizing the risk of hazard encounters.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to be a puzzle-platformer based on the sprite interactions and objectives described. The player navigates through a maze-like environment while manipulating objects and avoiding hazards in a quest to reach a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n  - **Ground**: A stationary element that serves as the playable area.\n  - **Hole**: A hazard that can kill the player (avatar) upon contact.\n  - **Goal**: The win condition; reaching this sprite rewards points and concludes the game.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character; interacts with other sprites to progress through the level.\n  - **Boxes and Boulders**: These can be moved or used to shield against hazards (like lasers).\n  - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Act as offensive hazards; the avatar must avoid them to survive.\n  - **Walls**: Obstacles that the player cannot pass through.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The interactions between the avatar, boulders, boxes, and hazards dictate game strategies.\n  - Certain interactions allow the player to block lasers (if there's a box in between), while others result in player movement backward or transformation into another state.\n  - Contact with certain elements like holes and lasers can lead to instant death, while reaching the goal will grant points and lead to a win condition if the player isn't dead.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards. The player must manage the interactions between the avatar, other objects (boxes, boulders), and hazards (lasers) effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also grants points.\n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - If the avatar counter reaches zero, the game concludes with a loss.\n  - Contact with specific hazards, like lasers in a frontal position or falling into a hole, will also lead to a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Carefully Analyze the Environment**: Before making any moves, evaluate the positioning of walls, hazards, and the goal. Understanding the layout can prevent unnecessary deaths.\n\n2. **Use Boxes for Protection**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from laser fire. Ensure strategic placement to create barriers between the avatar and any pressing hazards.\n\n3. **Manage Movements**: Avoid engaging with boulders head-on since these can push the avatar back or lead to transformation into a boulderm, which might restrict your options.\n\n4. **Plan the Path to the Goal**: Since there's a score system based on reaching the goal, always navigate towards it while being mindful of traps and hazards. The score affects the overall game outcome, so maximize points whilst minimizing risk.\n\n5. **Create Safe Zones**: Use boxes to block dangerous elements temporarily, creating a safe zone to plan your next moves.\n\n6. **Learn from Hazards**: Each failed attempt provides insight into the hazard's area of influence. Use this knowledge to devise a safer route in subsequent attempts.\n\n7. **Avoid Frontal Contact with Lasers and Holes**: Keep an eye on the avatar's positioning relative to danger zones, adjusting accordingly to avoid instant game over.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can methodically navigate through levels, overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving the goal while avoiding losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The player navigates through a maze-like environment while manipulating objects and avoiding hazards in a quest to reach a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n  - **Ground**: A stationary element that serves as the playable area.\n  - **Hole**: A hazard that can kill the player (avatar) upon contact.\n  - **Goal**: The win condition; reaching this sprite rewards points and concludes the game.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character; interacts with other sprites to progress through the level.\n  - **Boxes and Boulders**: These can be moved or used to shield against hazards (like lasers).\n  - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Act as offensive hazards; the avatar must avoid them to survive.\n  - **Walls**: Obstacles that the player cannot pass through.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The interactions between the avatar, boulders, boxes, and hazards dictate game strategies.\n  - Certain interactions allow the player to block lasers (if there's a box in between), while others result in player movement backward or transformation into another state.\n  - Contact with certain elements like holes and lasers can lead to instant death, while reaching the goal will grant points and lead to a win condition if the player isn't dead.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards. The player must manage the interactions between the avatar, other objects (boxes, boulders), and hazards (lasers) effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also grants points.\n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - If the avatar counter reaches zero, the game concludes with a loss.\n  - Contact with specific hazards, like lasers in a frontal position or falling into a hole, will also lead to a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Carefully Analyze the Environment**: Before making any moves, evaluate the positioning of walls, hazards, and the goal. Understanding the layout can prevent unnecessary deaths.\n\n2. **Use Boxes for Protection**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from laser fire. Ensure strategic placement to create barriers between the avatar and any pressing hazards.\n\n3. **Manage Movements**: Avoid engaging with boulders head-on since these can push the avatar back or lead to transformation into a boulderm, which might restrict your options.\n\n4. **Plan the Path to the Goal**: Since there's a score system based on reaching the goal, always navigate towards it while being mindful of traps and hazards. The score affects the overall game outcome, so maximize points whilst minimizing risk.\n\n5. **Create Safe Zones**: Use boxes to block dangerous elements temporarily, creating a safe zone to plan your next moves.\n\n6. **Learn from Hazards**: Each failed attempt provides insight into the hazard's area of influence. Use this knowledge to devise a safer route in subsequent attempts.\n\n7. **Avoid Frontal Contact with Lasers and Holes**: Keep an eye on the avatar's positioning relative to danger zones, adjusting accordingly to avoid instant game over.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can methodically navigate through levels, overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving the goal while avoiding losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

Moving the box will help create a safer path for the avatar while also providing protection against falling into the holes.\n\n2. **Goal**: Move the box to a location where it effectively blocks the holes, allowing safe passage toward the goal sprite ($).\n\n### Detailed Strategy\n\nIf pushing the box does not yield a beneficial outcome (for example, if the box cannot be moved due to walls or other obstacles):\n\n- **Assess the Immediate Environment**: After pushing the box, evaluate whether the avatar\u2019s position is now at minor risk due to nearby hazards. Confirm that the avatar is still safe to prevent any accidental loss.\n\n- **Identify the Nearest Interactable Item**: If pushing the box does not provide the desired effect, focus on the nearest **boulder (@)**. The boulder can also serve as protection against hazards or contribute to navigating toward the goal.\n\n### Next Step:\n\nOnce the box is either successfully pushed or found immovable due to constraints, the next actionable strategy should be to **Utilize the Boulder to Block Hazards or Create Pathways** toward the goal ($). This ensures that the player advances through the level while effectively managing hazards.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to be a puzzle-platformer based on the sprite interactions and objectives described. The player navigates through a maze-like environment while manipulating objects and avoiding hazards in a quest to reach a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n  - **Ground**: A stationary element that serves as the playable area.\n  - **Hole**: A hazard that can kill the player (avatar) upon contact.\n  - **Goal**: The win condition; reaching this sprite rewards points and concludes the game.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character; interacts with other sprites to progress through the level.\n  - **Boxes and Boulders**: These can be moved or used to shield against hazards (like lasers).\n  - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Act as offensive hazards; the avatar must avoid them to survive.\n  - **Walls**: Obstacles that the player cannot pass through.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The interactions between the avatar, boulders, boxes, and hazards dictate game strategies.\n  - Certain interactions allow the player to block lasers (if there's a box in between), while others result in player movement backward or transformation into another state.\n  - Contact with certain elements like holes and lasers can lead to instant death, while reaching the goal will grant points and lead to a win condition if the player isn't dead.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards. The player must manage the interactions between the avatar, other objects (boxes, boulders), and hazards (lasers) effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also grants points.\n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - If the avatar counter reaches zero, the game concludes with a loss.\n  - Contact with specific hazards, like lasers in a frontal position or falling into a hole, will also lead to a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Carefully Analyze the Environment**: Before making any moves, evaluate the positioning of walls, hazards, and the goal. Understanding the layout can prevent unnecessary deaths.\n\n2. **Use Boxes for Protection**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from laser fire. Ensure strategic placement to create barriers between the avatar and any pressing hazards.\n\n3. **Manage Movements**: Avoid engaging with boulders head-on since these can push the avatar back or lead to transformation into a boulderm, which might restrict your options.\n\n4. **Plan the Path to the Goal**: Since there's a score system based on reaching the goal, always navigate towards it while being mindful of traps and hazards. The score affects the overall game outcome, so maximize points whilst minimizing risk.\n\n5. **Create Safe Zones**: Use boxes to block dangerous elements temporarily, creating a safe zone to plan your next moves.\n\n6. **Learn from Hazards**: Each failed attempt provides insight into the hazard's area of influence. Use this knowledge to devise a safer route in subsequent attempts.\n\n7. **Avoid Frontal Contact with Lasers and Holes**: Keep an eye on the avatar's positioning relative to danger zones, adjusting accordingly to avoid instant game over.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can methodically navigate through levels, overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving the goal while avoiding losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Determine if the situation has improved or worsened.\n\n- **Identify the Nearest Item to Interact With**: If pushing the boulder isn\u2019t effective, focus on the nearest **box (#)**. The box can also serve as a barrier against holes or hazards and may help create a new path toward the goal.\n\n### Next Step:\n\nOnce the boulder is successfully pushed or if further movement is not feasible, the next actionable strategy should be to **Utilize the Box to Block Holes or Hazards** or **Reposition the Boulder** if there are new opportunities for movement.
