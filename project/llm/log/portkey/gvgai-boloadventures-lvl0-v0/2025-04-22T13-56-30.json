The player needs to navigate the environment, manipulate objects (like boxes and boulders), and avoid hazards to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions:**\n   - **Ground, Holes, Walls, and Goals:** These are your primary navigational elements. The goal sprite is critical as reaching it ends the game.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Passive Objects (Boxes and Boulders):** These can be moved to solve puzzles or create pathways. They can also be used defensively against lasers.\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers:** These are hazards that can kill the avatar if they come into contact, particularly from the front.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The various interactions define how the different sprites affect one another. For instance, the avatar can bounce off boxes, transforming boulders and boxes can result in different state changes, and the avatar can be killed by lasers if they approach them incorrectly.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate from the starting position (represented by 'A') to the goal ('g'), while avoiding hazards and using objects in the environment to reach the goal. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also results in a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar falls to zero (i.e., if the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion\n1. **Map Awareness:** Players should familiarize themselves with the layout. Knowing where lasers and other hazards are located will help in planning movements.\n \n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Wisely:** Use boxes to shield yourself from frontal lasers and to create paths. Manipulating boulders can allow you to block lasers or create walls that prevent the avatar from being hit.\n\n3. **Avoid Direct Paths to Lasers:** Since the avatar can be killed by lasers from the front, ensure to navigate around them by either using boxes for defense or finding alternative paths.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:** Before executing any moves, players should think about the consequences of actions\u2014what will happen to the boulders and boxes if moved, and how that might affect the pathway to the goal.\n\n5. **Utilize Lasers for Advantage:** If possible, use the timing of the lasers to your advantage by navigating around them while waiting for opportunities to move safely.\n\n6. **Reverse Actions as Needed:** If a move puts the player in a dangerous position (e.g., in front of a laser), players can leverage the undo actions available through the interaction mechanics.\n\nBy combining an understanding of the layout and strategic manipulation of the objects within the game, players can navigate effectively towards the goal while minimizing their risk of losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = *, col = *)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal sprite is critical as reaching it ends the game.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Passive Objects (Boxes and Boulders):** These can be moved to solve puzzles or create pathways. They can also be used defensively against lasers.\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers:** These are hazards that can kill the avatar if they come into contact, particularly from the front.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The various interactions define how the different sprites affect one another.

The goal sprite is critical as reaching it ends the game.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Passive Objects (Boxes and Boulders):** These can be moved to solve puzzles or create pathways. They can also be used defensively against lasers.\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers:** These are hazards that can kill the avatar if they come into contact, particularly from the front.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The various interactions define how the different sprites affect one another. For instance, the avatar can bounce off boxes, transforming boulders and boxes can result in different state changes, and the avatar can be killed by lasers if they approach them incorrectly.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate from the starting position (represented by 'A') to the goal ('g'), while avoiding hazards and using objects in the environment to reach the goal. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also results in a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar falls to zero (i.e., if the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion\n1. **Map Awareness:** Players should familiarize themselves with the layout. Knowing where lasers and other hazards are located will help in planning movements.\n \n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Wisely:** Use boxes to shield yourself from frontal lasers and to create paths.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the **puzzle/strategy** genre, incorporating elements of action given the presence of lasers and hazards. The player needs to navigate the environment, manipulate objects (like boxes and boulders), and avoid hazards to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions:**\n   - **Ground, Holes, Walls, and Goals:** These are your primary navigational elements. The goal sprite is critical as reaching it ends the game.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Passive Objects (Boxes and Boulders):** These can be moved to solve puzzles or create pathways. They can also be used defensively against lasers.\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers:** These are hazards that can kill the avatar if they come into contact, particularly from the front.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The various interactions define how the different sprites affect one another. For instance, the avatar can bounce off boxes, transforming boulders and boxes can result in different state changes, and the avatar can be killed by lasers if they approach them incorrectly.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate from the starting position (represented by 'A') to the goal ('g'), while avoiding hazards and using objects in the environment to reach the goal. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which also results in a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar falls to zero (i.e., if the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion\n1. **Map Awareness:** Players should familiarize themselves with the layout. Knowing where lasers and other hazards are located will help in planning movements.\n \n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Wisely:** Use boxes to shield yourself from frontal lasers and to create paths. Manipulating boulders can allow you to block lasers or create walls that prevent the avatar from being hit.\n\n3. **Avoid Direct Paths to Lasers:** Since the avatar can be killed by lasers from the front, ensure to navigate around them by either using boxes for defense or finding alternative paths.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:** Before executing any moves, players should think about the consequences of actions\u2014what will happen to the boulders and boxes if moved, and how that might affect the pathway to the goal.\n\n5. **Utilize Lasers for Advantage:** If possible, use the timing of the lasers to your advantage by navigating around them while waiting for opportunities to move safely.\n\n6. **Reverse Actions as Needed:** If a move puts the player in a dangerous position (e.g., in front of a laser), players can leverage the undo actions available through the interaction mechanics.\n\nBy combining an understanding of the layout and strategic manipulation of the objects within the game, players can navigate effectively towards the goal while minimizing their risk of losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'h'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhh...*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhh...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhh...*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhh...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 11, col = 2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Interact with the box ('*') to reposition it as a protective barrier against the lasers, ensuring safety and creating new opportunities to advance toward the goal.**\n\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
