It combines elements of spatial awareness, strategy, and obstacle navigation, often seen in games that require players to manipulate the environment and understand the interactions between different game elements.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites and their Functions:**  \n   - **Avatar (Player Character):** The primary sprite controlling player actions. The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, holes, and lasers.\n   - **Walls and Ground:** Impassable barriers that define the environment.\n   - **Boxes and Boulders:** These are movable and can interact with the avatar. They can also block lasers or activate various mechanics.\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers:** Act as hazards. The player must avoid lasers from the lasercannons while navigating the level.\n   - **Holes:** Represent a lethal area that can eliminate the avatar upon interaction.\n   - **Goal:** The endpoint of the level which, when reached by the avatar, allows for victory.\n  \n2. **Interactions:**  \n   - The avatar has specific interactions with each sprite type. For example, it can bounce off boxes, be killed by lasers, and can manipulate boulders.\n   - There are dynamic interactions like the ability for boulders to transform into a 'boulderm' and how boxes can shield the avatar from lasers.\n  \n3. **Termination Conditions:**  \n   - The objective is to reach the goal to win, while the avatar's score and game status are negatively impacted by being killed or trapped (SpriteCounter limit for the avatar is enforced).\n  \n### Objective:  \nThe objective is for the player (avatar) to reach the goal, represented by the closed door, while avoiding hazards like holes and lasers. Successfully passing through the goal will increase the player's score by five points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:  \n- **Win:** The player wins by navigating successfully to the goal (0) before losing all avatar lives (limit becomes 0).\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the avatar is killed by a laser or falls into a hole, causing the game to end.\n\n### Overall Strategy:  \nTo successfully complete the level, players should adopt the following strategies:\n\n1. **Plan Movement:** Before moving, observe the layout carefully. Note where the lasers are positioned and how they move relative to the avatar. Identify safe paths that avoid hazards.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Utilize boxes as shields against laser attacks. Position them strategically to block lasers while allowing the avatar to progress toward the goal.\n\n3. **Strategic Collision:** Avoid jumping into holes or getting caught by lasers. Use the interaction mechanics such as bouncing off boxes or leveraging boulders to create safe passage.\n\n4. **Manipulate Boulders:** Use boulders to your advantage by transforming them when necessary or avoiding them to ensure you don\u2019t become stuck.\n\n5. **Effective Timing:** Move with precision and patience, especially when lasers are active. Timing your movements to take advantage of opportunities when lasers are not firing will facilitate safer navigation.\n\n6. **Engage with the Environment:** Many interactions are present; understanding how various sprites affect one another can yield new routes or safety measures.\n\nFollowing these strategies and understanding the mechanics will provide a solid path toward reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing the avatar due to the hazards in the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Position them strategically to block lasers while allowing the avatar to progress toward the goal.\n\n3. **Strategic Collision:** Avoid jumping into holes or getting caught by lasers. Use the interaction mechanics such as bouncing off boxes or leveraging boulders to create safe passage.\n\n4. **Manipulate Boulders:** Use boulders to your advantage by transforming them when necessary or avoiding them to ensure you don\u2019t become stuck.\n\n5. **Effective Timing:** Move with precision and patience, especially when lasers are active. Timing your movements to take advantage of opportunities when lasers are not firing will facilitate safer navigation.\n\n6. **Engage with the Environment:** Many interactions are present; understanding how various sprites affect one another can yield new routes or safety measures.\n\nFollowing these strategies and understanding the mechanics will provide a solid path toward reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing the avatar due to the hazards in the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb.....................%b\nb.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...@.%b\nb...@............b.@..%b\nb..b.bbbbbbbbbb.@.%....b\nb@@b...........bb...b..b\nb..b....@.@....bbb.bbb.b\nb..b.....@.....b&*.....b\nb@@b...@.......b&*.....b\nb..b...#..b%%%%...@...%b\nb..b......b..........%%b\nb.ab......b.........%%$b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=2)=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nPush the box to the right to create a barrier against the holes and clear a path toward the goal, while remaining vigilant in case the surrounding hazards or state of play alters and requires a change in approach.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
