It involves strategic placement and movement of various sprites (blocks, lasers, etc.) to achieve a primary objective.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** Various types of sprites (ground, boulders, lasers, walls, avatar, goal) interact with each other in specific ways. The avatar can move and interact with these different sprites.\n2. **Interactions:** There are multiple interaction types, including:\n   - Killing (certain sprites can kill the avatar)\n   - Transforming (boulders can change into boulderm when interacting with certain elements)\n   - Attracting gazes (boulderm attracts gazes when the avatar interacts with it)\n   - Shielding (the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks)\n   - Undoing actions (a specific combination can undo previous moves)\n3. **Movement:** The avatar can move around the space, but is restricted by walls, and it steps back if it encounters a wall or other obstacles.\n4. **Goal Condition:** The ultimate goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which gives a score increase and signifies winning the level.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level and reach the goal while avoiding obstacles. Players need to manipulate other sprites (such as boxes and boulders) strategically to create pathways or remove threats.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Winning Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which also grants a score increase.\n- **Losing Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is killed by lasers or boulders at any point, or if the number of avatars present drops to zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout and the locations of walls, obstacles, and the goal. Understanding where you can move and potential hazards is critical.\n  \n2. **Utilize Shields:** Use boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks. Position boxes between the avatar and the lasers to block their path.\n\n3. **Manage Boulders:** Be mindful of the boulders and use them strategically. They can be transformed and manipulated, potentially creating pathways or removing hazards when they interact with other sprites.\n\n4. **Plan Movements:** Each movement may provoke reactions (like killing or stepping back), so plan out routes in advance to avoid unnecessary setbacks.\n\n5. **Create Pathways:** Use boxes and boulders to create a clear path to the goal while avoiding dead ends or obstacles that can kill your avatar.\n\n6. **Observe Interactions:** Pay close attention to how the sprites interact with one another, such as how lasers can kill or how boulders can interact with walls and the avatar.\n\n7. **Iterate on Strategies:** If you encounter a level that results in failure, take the time to analyze what went wrong. Adjust your strategies accordingly in subsequent attempts.\n\nBy combining these strategies and understanding the mechanics involved, players would be better equipped to navigate through the level successfully and achieve the ultimate objective of reaching the goal sprite.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**  \nBased on the description of the sprites, interactions, and termination conditions, this game seems to fit within the puzzle and platformer genre. It involves strategic placement and movement of various sprites (blocks, lasers, etc.) to achieve a primary objective.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** Various types of sprites (ground, boulders, lasers, walls, avatar, goal) interact with each other in specific ways. The avatar can move and interact with these different sprites.\n2. **Interactions:** There are multiple interaction types, including:\n   - Killing (certain sprites can kill the avatar)\n   - Transforming (boulders can change into boulderm when interacting with certain elements)\n   - Attracting gazes (boulderm attracts gazes when the avatar interacts with it)\n   - Shielding (the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks)\n   - Undoing actions (a specific combination can undo previous moves)\n3. **Movement:** The avatar can move around the space, but is restricted by walls, and it steps back if it encounters a wall or other obstacles.\n4. **Goal Condition:** The ultimate goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which gives a score increase and signifies winning the level.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level and reach the goal while avoiding obstacles. Players need to manipulate other sprites (such as boxes and boulders) strategically to create pathways or remove threats.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Winning Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which also grants a score increase.\n- **Losing Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is killed by lasers or boulders at any point, or if the number of avatars present drops to zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout and the locations of walls, obstacles, and the goal. Understanding where you can move and potential hazards is critical.\n  \n2. **Utilize Shields:** Use boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks. Position boxes between the avatar and the lasers to block their path.\n\n3. **Manage Boulders:** Be mindful of the boulders and use them strategically. They can be transformed and manipulated, potentially creating pathways or removing hazards when they interact with other sprites.\n\n4. **Plan Movements:** Each movement may provoke reactions (like killing or stepping back), so plan out routes in advance to avoid unnecessary setbacks.\n\n5. **Create Pathways:** Use boxes and boulders to create a clear path to the goal while avoiding dead ends or obstacles that can kill your avatar.\n\n6. **Observe Interactions:** Pay close attention to how the sprites interact with one another, such as how lasers can kill or how boulders can interact with walls and the avatar.\n\n7. **Iterate on Strategies:** If you encounter a level that results in failure, take the time to analyze what went wrong. Adjust your strategies accordingly in subsequent attempts.\n\nBy combining these strategies and understanding the mechanics involved, players would be better equipped to navigate through the level successfully and achieve the ultimate objective of reaching the goal sprite.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

It involves strategic placement and movement of various sprites (blocks, lasers, etc.) to achieve a primary objective.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** Various types of sprites (ground, boulders, lasers, walls, avatar, goal) interact with each other in specific ways. The avatar can move and interact with these different sprites.\n2. **Interactions:** There are multiple interaction types, including:\n   - Killing (certain sprites can kill the avatar)\n   - Transforming (boulders can change into boulderm when interacting with certain elements)\n   - Attracting gazes (boulderm attracts gazes when the avatar interacts with it)\n   - Shielding (the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks)\n   - Undoing actions (a specific combination can undo previous moves)\n3. **Movement:** The avatar can move around the space, but is restricted by walls, and it steps back if it encounters a wall or other obstacles.\n4. **Goal Condition:** The ultimate goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which gives a score increase and signifies winning the level.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level and reach the goal while avoiding obstacles. Players need to manipulate other sprites (such as boxes and boulders) strategically to create pathways or remove threats.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Winning Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which also grants a score increase.\n- **Losing Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is killed by lasers or boulders at any point, or if the number of avatars present drops to zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout and the locations of walls, obstacles, and the goal. Understanding where you can move and potential hazards is critical.\n  \n2. **Utilize Shields:** Use boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks. Position boxes between the avatar and the lasers to block their path.\n\n3. **Manage Boulders:** Be mindful of the boulders and use them strategically. They can be transformed and manipulated, potentially creating pathways or removing hazards when they interact with other sprites.\n\n4. **Plan Movements:** Each movement may provoke reactions (like killing or stepping back), so plan out routes in advance to avoid unnecessary setbacks.\n\n5. **Create Pathways:** Use boxes and boulders to create a clear path to the goal while avoiding dead ends or obstacles that can kill your avatar.\n\n6. **Observe Interactions:** Pay close attention to how the sprites interact with one another, such as how lasers can kill or how boulders can interact with walls and the avatar.\n\n7. **Iterate on Strategies:** If you encounter a level that results in failure, take the time to analyze what went wrong. Adjust your strategies accordingly in subsequent attempts.\n\nBy combining these strategies and understanding the mechanics involved, players would be better equipped to navigate through the level successfully and achieve the ultimate objective of reaching the goal sprite.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

They can be transformed and manipulated, potentially creating pathways or removing hazards when they interact with other sprites.\n\n4. **Plan Movements:** Each movement may provoke reactions (like killing or stepping back), so plan out routes in advance to avoid unnecessary setbacks.\n\n5. **Create Pathways:** Use boxes and boulders to create a clear path to the goal while avoiding dead ends or obstacles that can kill your avatar.\n\n6. **Observe Interactions:** Pay close attention to how the sprites interact with one another, such as how lasers can kill or how boulders can interact with walls and the avatar.\n\n7. **Iterate on Strategies:** If you encounter a level that results in failure, take the time to analyze what went wrong. Adjust your strategies accordingly in subsequent attempts.\n\nBy combining these strategies and understanding the mechanics involved, players would be better equipped to navigate through the level successfully and achieve the ultimate objective of reaching the goal sprite.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

It involves strategic placement and movement of various sprites (blocks, lasers, etc.) to achieve a primary objective.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** Various types of sprites (ground, boulders, lasers, walls, avatar, goal) interact with each other in specific ways. The avatar can move and interact with these different sprites.\n2. **Interactions:** There are multiple interaction types, including:\n   - Killing (certain sprites can kill the avatar)\n   - Transforming (boulders can change into boulderm when interacting with certain elements)\n   - Attracting gazes (boulderm attracts gazes when the avatar interacts with it)\n   - Shielding (the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks)\n   - Undoing actions (a specific combination can undo previous moves)\n3. **Movement:** The avatar can move around the space, but is restricted by walls, and it steps back if it encounters a wall or other obstacles.\n4. **Goal Condition:** The ultimate goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which gives a score increase and signifies winning the level.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level and reach the goal while avoiding obstacles.
