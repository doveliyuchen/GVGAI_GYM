Players maneuver an avatar through a spatial environment, interacting with various immovable and movable objects (like walls, boxes, and boulders) to reach a goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Movements**: \n  - The game features various sprite types, including walls, boxes, boulders, tunnels, goals, lasers, and hazards such as holes.\n  - The avatar can interact with these sprites in specific ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, transforming into boulders, being killed by lasers).\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - The mechanics encourage strategic movement, as some interactions result in transformations or can lead to winning or losing (e.g., the avatar can die upon contact with a laser, or transform into a boulder).\n  - The avatar can use boxes as shields against lasers, allowing for tactical block placement or movement.\n  \n- **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player wins by reaching the goal with the avatar (which increases score).\n  - The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (the sprite counter for the avatar reaching 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar towards the goal while avoiding dangers (lasers and holes) and utilizing the boxes and boulders effectively to create a safe path. Each successful interaction can impact the environment and change the behavior of various sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - Reach the \"goal\" sprite, which also provides score points.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - The avatar is killed by lasers or falls into holes, reducing its count to zero, resulting in a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Analyze the Layout**: \n   - Study the level layout and the position of walls, hazards, and the goal. Identify safe paths and possible routes to navigate through the obstacles.\n\n2. **Proactive Movement**: \n   - Move the avatar carefully, taking note of the proximity of hazards such as lasers and holes. Always anticipate and plan your next move in relation to potential dangers.\n\n3. **Use Boxes and Boulders**: \n   - Utilize boxes to shield against lasers and create barriers. Since boxes bounce and can undo interactions, manipulate them to your advantage to navigate through the level.\n\n4. **Manage Transformations**: \n   - Be aware that transforming into a boulder or being a boulderm (dynamic boulder) can change interactions with other sprites. Use this strategically to move past otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n5. **Utilize Lasers Wisely**: \n   - Keep lasers in mind for both avoiding them and using them against obstacles or enemies. Understanding their pattern can help navigate through potential dangers while still progressing toward the goal.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**:\n   - Keep in mind the score changes associated with various interactions, such as killing sprites or reaching the goal. Strategically plan to maximize your score while minimizing risk.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: \n   - If certain paths seem untenable, allowing for mistakes can lead to learning the specific sprite interactions and how they can be manipulated in future attempts.\n\nBy applying these principles, players can effectively progress through the game, utilizing the mechanics available for optimal navigation and strategy development.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Your immediate surroundings will determine subsequent moves. \n   - Ensure that moving in any direction does not lead into a wall (`*`), hazard (`#`), or moving yourself unintentionally into a position that leads to a loss.\n\n2. **Utilize Open Spaces**:\n   - Utilize the `.` spaces effectively. Move the avatar into these open areas to have visibility of possible routes to maneuver toward the goal.\n\n3. **Push Boxes Strategically**:\n   - Focus on interacting with the boxes (denoted by `c`). Analyze if pushing a box can either block hazards (like lasers) or create a pathway that leads you closer to the goal. \n   - Always check if a box can fall into or block off a route that is currently hazardous.\n\n4. **Leverage Boulder Transformations**:\n   - If available, strategically become a boulder. Use this form to interact with hazards safely or to possibly move through barriers (if your game allows it).\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Carefully plan your route to avoid hazards (`#`). Monitor the movements of any lasers near your path and anticipate when to move to stay clear of them.\n   - If certain paths appear blocked or compromised by them, an alternative route may need to be found.\n\n6. **Aim for the Goal with Care**:\n   - When close to the goal (`$`), ensure that you stay out of reach from any remaining hazards. If necessary, look for a final set of boxes to create a shield before moving in for the win.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop**:\n   - If you find yourself trapped or losing a life, take note of where you went wrong. Use that knowledge in subsequent trials by adjusting your strategy and movement patterns accordingly.\n\n### Suggested Steps Based on Given Current State\n1. Move right, toward the first box:\n   - `@` moves to where a box can be interacted with (`c`).\n   \n2. Observe the future movement paths and determine if you can move other boxes for positioning, making clear paths to avoid the `#` hazards.\n\n3. Once you've moved the necessary boxes, head toward the bottom right corner for a potentially safer approach to the goal (`$`).\n\nBy adhering to this strategic framework, players can increase their likelihood of success while moving through the game effectively. Always maintain the agility to adapt to dynamic changes in the state of play and prioritize survival and scoring potential at every turn.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Below is a tailored strategy based on the provided state.\n\n### Current State Overview (with Key Symbols)\n- **`@`**: Avatar\n- **`*`**: Wall (impassable)\n- **`.`**: Open space (can move freely)\n- **`%`**: Goal area (hazardous zone that could lead to losing if stepped upon directly)\n- **`#`**: Hazard (laser or dangerous object)\n- **`&`**: Box (movable)\n- **`$`**: Exit/Goal (where the avatar aims to reach)\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Assess the Immediate Situation\n- **Location of Avatar**: The avatar is positioned near multiple potential paths amidst walls and hazards.\n- **Goal Position**: The exit goal (`$`) is located in the bottom right corner.\n- **Hazards**: There are lasers (`%` and `#`) in proximity that need to be avoided.\n\n#### Step 2: Plan the Next Move\n1. **Initial Movement: Move Right-In Front of Goal**\n   - If possible, move the avatar to an empty square adjacent to one of the boxes or to an open space that is not threatened by walls or hazards.\n\n2. **Box Movement for Protection**:\n   - Consider pushing adjacent boxes (`&`) strategically to block lasers and create a barrier.\n   - This means coordinating box movement such that it provides safe passage for the avatar towards the exit while minimizing the risk of encountering lasers.\n\n3. **Aim Towards the Goal**:\n   - As you manipulate boxes, always steer movements toward heading down and toward the right, moving closer to the position of the goal (`$`).\n\n#### Step 3: Tactical Interaction with Boxes\n- **When Pushing Boxes:**\n  - Use boxes as shields to effectively create barriers between the avatar and hazards, allowing safe access to potentially dangerous paths.\n  - Avoid placing the boxes in positions that will block your own access to the goal or trap the avatar.\n\n#### Step 4: Progress Towards the Goal\n- After successfully maneuvering boxes for protection, head directly toward the goal (`$`). Be aware of not moving into any adjacent hazards caused by lasers or walls that might inadvertently cause loss.\n\n#### Step 5: Implement Risk Assessment\n- Continuously assess each movement:\n   - Move cautiously, ensuring no step leads into a hazard. \n   - Anticipate possible future moves and adjust accordingly if a pathway looks to become blocked or dangerous.\n\n### Example Moves Based on Current State\n1. If positioned in a clear space next to box (`&`), push the box away or block it in a way that will shield a laser while moving the avatar right.\n2. Subsequently, make open movements either down or to the right to get closer to the goal (`$`).\n\n### Recap of the Primary Objectives\n- Ensure protection from hazards while strategically utilizing boxes.\n- Maintain a focus on reaching the goal while maximizing open paths.\n- Learn and adapt from interactions and situations encountered to allow flexibility in response to unexpected changes in the level layout.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the current state, prioritizing safety through interactive mechanics, and methodically moving the avatar, you can navigate toward the win condition successfully. Continue to stay aware and adapt as you advance!\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

The immediate surroundings appear complex, with multiple layers of walls and hazards.\n\n### State Recap\n- **Avatar Position**: `@` is located in the center with walls surrounding it, needing to navigate through holes and boulders.\n- **Goal Position**: There is a goal at one edge of the maze where the avatar aims to end up safely.\n- **Hazards**: There are holes that can kill the avatar if they land in any, and walls that obstruct movement.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Assess Immediate Options \nAnalyze the immediate surrounding spaces, especially noting any hazards and potential safe paths:\n- **Direct Movement Options**: The avatar can consider moving:\n  - Up or down to the spaces adjacent to the current position.\n  - Left to a potential box for future uses.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Safe Paths \nLook for potential safe movements while avoiding the holes:\n1. **Movement Away from Holes**: Avoid moving toward the holes, as this is a loss condition.\n2. **Box Manipulation**: Consider leveraging boxes (`c`) and any boulders (`b`) that are nearby to create safe paths.\n\n#### Step 3: Plan Your Move\nHere is a suggested immediate move:\n- **Move Up**: Move the avatar `@` vertically to the space above (this space is empty) and keep evaluating the lay of the land. This movement places the avatar above the holes and opens up future options.\n\n#### Step 4: Utilize Boxes and Boulder\nOnce moved upward, deploy these strategies in subsequent moves:\n1. **Interact with Nearby Boxes**: If possible on the next move to push a box to create a barrier against the holes.\n2. **Utilize Boulders**: Use or interact with nearby boulders (`b`) to further form pathways to circumvent hazards or create blockades against holes.\n\n#### Step 5: Continuous Risk Assessment\n- As you maneuver, continuously check the surrounding squares for potential threats. Make sure each move maintains safety away from hazards while progressing toward the goal.\n\n### Next Moves Example\n1. Move the avatar (`@`) to the cell directly above (an empty space).\n2. From there, depending on the new layout surrounding the avatar, consider moving left or manipulating a box to help you progress without endangerment.\n\n### Strategy Reevaluation\nAfter each move, reevaluate:\n- Were you able to create solid barriers?\n- Does the path still lead towards the goal while avoiding hazards?\n- Are there other boulders or boxes you might not have utilized optimally?\n\nBy being tactical and mindful of hazards and utilizing the mechanics of boxes and boulders, this strategy intends to ensure optimal advancement towards the goal while avoiding loss conditions.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Movement should always aim to stay clear of such dangers.\n- **Evaluate Paths**: \n   - Regularly reassess potential paths toward the goal, focusing on maintaining options that keep the avatar away from holes.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Final Actions:\n- Once a box is either pushed or positioned, reassess its placement:\n  - Ensure the box creates a barrier against falling into holes or facilitates movement toward the bottom row where the goal sits.\n  \n#### Step 5: Execute Stepwise Movements\nBased on probable next moves, here\u2019s how you can execute:\n1. **Move Up**: Move the avatar (`@`) up to an adjacent empty space or box space.\n2. **Push Box**: If the avatar reaches a box, push it down or sideways to block holes or shift it to create space towards the goal.\n3. **Continue Downward Movements**: Once pathways are established towards the bottom, move steadily down toward the goal location.\n\n### Example Next Moves\n1. **If on a box** (`&` moved): Move the avatar up.\n2. **From a safe position**: Consider pushing a box to create pathways or barriers.\n3. **Always re-check the risk**: After every movement, ensure the risk factor remains low against hazards.\n\n### Keep Adapting\n- As the game progresses, continue evaluating the effectiveness of each move, maintaining flexibility in strategy, and adjusting based on the outcomes of each action.\n\nIn this fashion, careful navigation combined with strategic box manipulation can lead successfully to the goal while ensuring the avatar's integrity. With each step, assess the risks and adapt the strategy as required!\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"
