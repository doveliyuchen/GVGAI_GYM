Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind. Certain interactions could provide advantages if you're aiming for higher scores; avoid unnecessary risks while securing those points.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the challenges presented by the level layout, successfully reach the goal sprite, and ensure their survival against the hazards they encounter.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The player is currently situated to the left of a significant number of obstacles and hazards.\n   - Determine safe tiles to move to by analyzing paths devoid of immediate threats (hazards, walls).\n\n2. **Use Walls for Protection**:\n   - Since the player is surrounded by `*` (representing obstacles) and walls, identify if moving towards these walls offers a safe position or gives access to other pathways.\n\n3. **Maintain Distance from Hazards**:\n   - Avoid moving into tiles that contain '%' unless there is a necessary maneuver towards the goal.\n   - Prioritize movement to routes that lead away from hazards to minimize the risk of losing a life.\n\n4. **Chain Interactions**:\n   - If the player can perform moves that trigger other interactions with the surrounding elements (for instance creating a safe path with walls/boxes), ensure to do that as necessary.\n\n5. **Evaluate Available Options**:\n   - Check tiles marked with `*` to figure out if moving onto them might create additional pathways or facilitate a future move.\n   - Any tile leading closer to the exit (denoted by '$') or providing greater mobility should be prioritized.\n\n#### Tactical Steps\n1. **Move to a safer tile**: \n   - For example, if any tile (with potential movement) directly towards the exit is available, make that move carefully, assessing if further tiles are accessible afterward. \n\n2. **Monitor for Chain Reactions**: \n   - As you move further, continuously evaluate if any movement could cause a chain reaction (like pushing a box or boulder) that could clear a path towards the goal.\n\n3. **Sequential Navigation**:\n   - Progress in small increments towards the exit and reassess hazards after each move. Ensure you are not boxed in or directly in the line of potential laser paths. \n\n4. **Score Consideration**:\n   - While maintaining safety, keep an eye for opportunities that allow for score increases (such as interacting with collectibles or crates appropriately).\n\n5. **Escape Routes**:\n   - Always leave an alternative path available that can be taken if the current maneuver leads into a precarious situation.\n\n### Example Move Flow\n- Move **Down or Right** towards `**` to create more pathways. \n- If walls are blocking further navigation, pivot to assess another untouched area of the grid that might lead towards the exit.\n\nBy following this strategic outline, the player can effectively progress towards the game\u2019s objectives while minimizing risk from hazards and maximizing potential routes to the finish line. Adapt the plan as you move and keep assessing the grid for any opportunities or threats.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Avoid moving into tiles marked by `%` which signify hazards.\n\n2. **Move Towards the Goal**:\n   - Assess the paths available towards the goal (`$`). Your moves should ideally bring you closer to this endpoint without falling into hazardous areas.\n   \n3. **Utilize Open Spaces**:\n   - There are open spaces denoted by `.` that allow for movement. Focus on navigating to these tiles while keeping an eye on potential interactions with obstacles.\n\n4. **Consider Allowed Movements**:\n   - You can move to `*` tiles, which are obstacles, but try to keep a safe distance from hazards as much as possible. The movement can be restricted around tight spaces.\n\n5. **Evaluate Daisy Chain Potential**:\n   - Look for opportunities to create a chain reaction, perhaps by moving around the `*` tiles to manipulate the positioning of adjacent sprites or to push boxes and clear movement lanes.\n\n#### Specific Action Plan\n- **Suggested Moves**: \n  - Aim to maneuver to an adjacent `.` tile, which will allow you more freedom next turn. \n  - Since the player symbol is adjacent to `@` and possibly creating a clutter, consider moving to an open tile to maintain flexibility, such as moving left/down if possible.\n\n- **Example Move**: Move from your current location `@` in one of the directions where it does not take you into hazards:\n  - Consider moving **down to the bottom row**, which is clearer and provides more options toward escaping the current area.\n  \n- **Keep Watch on Future Moves**:\n   - Plan your next moves in two or three steps ahead, maintaining a buffer between you and the hazards (`%`).\n   - Move to tiles that allow for a possible return route in case hazards block your forward progress.\n\n### Anticipated Next Steps\n1. **Navigating Open Paths**: After the next move, continue to assess the grid for potential hazards and ensure that your movements maintain or create paths toward the goal.\n2. **Interaction with Obstacles**: Be mindful of how many obstacles are available for manipulation and how they can be maximally leveraged to avoid hazards or redirect them, such as using walls/boxes for safety.\n3. **Continuous Assessment**: Always reassess after each move to ensure that you are not cornering yourself and that you still have multiple routes available towards the exit.\n\nBy following these strategies, you will be better positioned to navigate through this puzzle/platformer effectively, while mitigating risks and making consistent progress toward your goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

The goal is located at the bottom of the grid.\n- The environment consists of walls (`wall`), hazards (such as holes), obstacles (like `boulder` and `box`), and several empty spaces (denoted by `,`).\n- The avatar has limited movement options due to walls surrounding the space and needs to navigate through a series of obstacles and hazards to reach the goal.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Move Options**:\n   - Determine the adjacent tiles to the avatar. The available options are limited; currently, the avatar can only move down or right (depending on the position of walls and other obstacles).\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Ensure that the next move does not place the avatar in immediate risk of falling into a hole or getting trapped by walls. Check the adjacent hazards (e.g., holes) and plan to avoid them.\n\n3. **Strategic Movement**:\n   - From the current position, if possible:\n     - **Move Down**: If the position directly below the avatar is a safe space (not a hole), move down towards the `hole` tiles. \n     - **Stay away from Hazards**: If moving down is not safe because it leads to a hole, consider other options and avoid shifting into holes especially.\n\n4. **Exploit Open Spaces**:\n   - Look for opportunities to navigate the open spaces next to obstacles. If adjacent tiles provide a route around hazards, use them to maneuver safely towards the goal.\n\n5. **Plan for Future Moves**:\n   - Always be one step ahead. After your current move, ensure there will still be other safe paths available to you. \n\n6. **Utilize Obstacles**:\n   - If possible, leverage any boxes or boulders to create new paths. Although moving boxes requires careful consideration so as not to block potential exits or paths.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Step\n- **Move Down**: Assuming the space directly below the `avatar` is a `hole`, it's crucial to evaluate if a move can be made safely downward. If the tile down is occupied by a `hole`, choose to **move right** to open positions instead.\n- If adjacent tiles are clear, facilitate your movement downward while keeping an eye on the walls and holes.\n\n### Anticipated Next Steps\n- **Continue Navigating**: Once you have made your immediate move, reassess your surroundings and check possible routes towards the goal again, ensuring that:\n  - You maintain distance from walls and hazards.\n  - You are heading toward unexplored areas which could provide further pathways to the goal.\n\n- **Avoid Getting Stuck**: Ensure that each move retains available options for advancement toward the exit. If options narrow, reconsider your strategy and look for safe backtrack points as necessary.\n\nBy following this strategy, you can effectively navigate through the level while making progress towards the goal while keeping safety as the top priority. Adapt your moves based on immediate feedback from each step taken.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

From the current position, the avatar can potentially move left or down, depending on the tiles there.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Avoid moving to tiles that lead directly into hazards like holes (`hole`). Safety should always come first.\n\n3. **Maximize Pathways**:\n   - Use the open tiles (marked by commas `,`) to navigate towards the goal without risking falling into holes. \n\n4. **Use Obstacles Strategically**:\n   - If the avatar has to move next to boulders or boxes, these can be leveraged to shield against hazards. However, be cautious about how these moves might obstruct future paths.\n\n5. **Plan Next Moves**:\n   - Think multiple steps ahead to ensure that each action leads toward the goal while avoiding entrapment by walls or hazards.\n\n### Specific Actions Based on Current State\n\n#### Immediate Step Options:\n- **Move Down**: \n  - If there is an open space directly below the avatar, move downwards. This is crucial because it opens up potential pathways while moving towards the goal.\n- **Move Left**: \n  - Only consider moving left if it is safe (i.e., not directly adjacent to a hole and if it doesn\u2019t lead to an enclosed space with no further paths).\n\n### Example Move:\n1. **Checking Downward Move**:\n   - The avatar's immediate downward space appears to lead toward a `hole`, which is unsafe. \n2. **Checking Left Move**:\n   - Move left (from the `avatar` marker) to an adjacent empty space if safe. Ensure this does not lead directly into a wall or hole.\n   \n#### After Moving:\n- After the move, reassess the surroundings again:\n  - Identify any new obstacles or holes that have come into play.\n  - Determine the best route toward the goal while maintaining safe distances from hazards.\n\n### Anticipated Future Moves:\n- Continue navigating in small increments, prioritizing spaces leading towards the goal while keeping alternatives open.\n- Always monitor the positions of holes and walls after each move to avoid getting cornered and to plan subsequent actions effectively.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies, you will increase your chances of successfully navigating the level while avoiding hazards, and optimize your path toward the goal as efficiently as possible. Adapt as necessary based on the immediate grid layout encountered after each turn.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

The goal is to identify safe tiles to move without falling into holes or steering towards walls that could block further movement.\n\n2. **Assess Safety**:\n   - Avoid moving to any adjacent tile that leads into a hole or that would result in being trapped by walls.\n   - Carefully consider vertical and horizontal moves, ensuring they lead to open tiles while moving toward the goal.\n\n3. **Utilizing Obstacles**:\n   - Boulders can serve various purposes\u2014blocking potential hazards or creating pathways. Analyze if moving adjacent to these elements can help create a safer navigator's route.\n\n4. **Clear Path Toward the Goal**:\n   - Aim to navigate toward the goal effectively, moving through open spaces while monitoring paths to the goal to keep them accessible.\n\n### Specific Moves Based on Current Position\n- The avatar is currently at position `(row, column)` (based on your description, it's at the coordinates just before the goal's position and surrounded by walls).\n  \n#### Suggested Move:\n1. **Move Right**:\n   - If the tile immediately to the right of the avatar is clear (not a wall or a hole), move right. This action opens up opportunities to reach the goal in subsequent moves.\n  \n2. **Monitoring Subsequent Paths**:\n   - After the right move, check the adjacent tiles again to see if there are further openings that allow movement towards the goal without risking exposure to hazards.\n\n### Future Move Considerations:\n- **Continuous Evaluation**: After making the right move, reassess the available tiles. If the next moves continue to stay clear of hazards and open a pathway towards the goal, follow through.\n- **Backup Routes**: Always have a secondary path in mind should the next immediate move block off the path to the goal via unexpected encounters with hazards or walls.\n\n### Anticipated Outcomes:\n- Moving right will create direct access to further tiles and allow a structured pathway to reach the goal, assuming no hazards prevent that next tile's safety.\n- Each time you move, always visualize the consequences it may entail and adapt accordingly.\n\nBy employing this strategy, you will effectively maneuver through the level toward the goal while minimizing risks of hazards, ultimately securing a win. Stay adaptable based on interactions with the environment and the layout of walls and obstacles.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Directly below the avatar is a row that contains multiple holes, making downward movement perilous.\n- There are walls to the left and right of the avatar that restrict movement in those directions.\n- The goal is directly below the avatar, but due to the immediate hazards, a careful approach is necessary.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Movement Options**:\n   - Since the spaces to the left and right are walls, the avatar can attempt to move down on the next turn, but only if that path is safe.\n   - Before making a downward movement, ascertain whether the immediate tile below the avatar is clear of hazards (i.e., holes).\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - If moving down leads to a hole, the avatar should not proceed downward as this would result in a loss.\n   - Assess any options that avoid putting the avatar into immediate danger from falling into a hole.\n\n3. **Utilization of Obstacles**:\n   - If moving down is unsafe, consider nearby boulders or boxes to see if there's a way to navigate around hazards or to block holes effectively. However, in this case, there\u2019s a risk of a boulder falling into an area with a hole, which would count as a failure.\n\n4. **Consider Movement to a Safer Tile**:\n   - If moving down is not possible, check if there's a potential safe movement to an empty tile if there are no hazards there.\n   - Identify if moving to the left or right (if available after the bottom check) leads to any new pathways.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Assess the Tile Below**:\n   - **Check the tile immediately beneath the avatar**:\n     - If it is a hole, the avatar cannot move down and will need to move up to an accessible previous tile and then strategize its movements from there with a better sense of how to reach the goal.\n\n2. **If Safe Movement**:\n   - If the tile directly below is safe, **move down to the goal**. \n\n### Future Move Considerations:\n- **Reassess Surroundings After Initial Move**:\n  - If the move is made, examine what new options are available, checking tiles for hazards and potential movements to avoid getting cornered.\n  - Identify if there are boxes you can push or boulders that can be moved to create a safe pathway.\n\n- **Maintain Strategic Alignment**:\n  - Always reassess based on the avatar\u2019s new position. Keep moving toward the goal while avoiding hazards. \n\n### Overall Goal:\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal safely. Given the current situation, caution is necessary. Understanding the grid layout and interactions between different elements is key to success.\n\nBy implementing this strategy, you will be better prepared to navigate through the current layout of the grid while maximizing your chances of safely reaching the goal. Stay vigilant about potential hazards and always reassess your options after each move!\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

This action allows the avatar to explore other row options and potentially gain a better perspective on how to maneuver toward the goal in the subsequent turns.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- After moving up, reassess the surrounding tiles for immediate movement options. Look for paths that can help in maneuvering efficiently:\n  - Identify any spaces that could lead back down toward the goal safely, or help shift direction to explore adjacent tiles once again.\n  - Check if there are boulders or boxes on the row above that can be utilized to manipulate the layout further.\n\n- **Maintain Flexibility**:\n  - Continuously monitor the positions of hazards (like holes) as you make each move. Adapt the strategy based on the newly accessible tiles after every turn.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe primary goal remains to reach the goal without falling into hazards. By executing the upward move from the current position, you advance while keeping safety in mind. Each action should be calculated to maximize progress towards the goal while avoiding any risks from hazards.\n\nThis structured approach ensures you've considered all possible outcomes while minimizing potential risks associated with the next move.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

This will clear the space and may also provide an opportunity to move around to the right, or down towards the goal indirectly.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After Moving the Boulder**:\n   - Reassess the surrounding tiles to see if moving up, down, or to the sides has changed due to the boulder's adjustment.\n   - Look for an effective route either directly towards the goal or towards tiles that open up new options.\n\n- **Check for Other Hazards**:\n   - Make sure to monitor the position of any holes as you navigate, ensuring the next moves remain safe and viable.\n\n### Maintain Flexibility\n- **Adapt to New Positions**: As the avatar\u2019s position changes, always reassess what's available based on how the layout evolves. New movements may open additional pathways toward the goal.\n- **Strategize on the Fly**: If pushing the boulder does not yield favorable results, rethink the strategy based on newly accessible tiles and obstacles.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe main goal remains to navigate safely toward the goal without falling into hazards. By focusing on the immediate boulder movement and subsequent reevaluation of the grid, the avatar can effectively position itself for future success.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the avatar can answer the challenges posed by the surrounding grid while maintaining focus on reaching the goal.

Any subsequent move should keep the path toward the goal safe and unobstructed.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Boulder Left**:\n   - If the left tile is open (meaning there is no wall), push the boulder left. This movement could potentially block one of the nearby holes and open more pathways for the avatar in future turns.\n\n2. **Alternative Move**:\n   - If the left tile is not available for pushing the boulder, consider any other safe movement that allows reassessment of future moves.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **Reassess New Position**: After the boulder has been pushed or the avatar has moved, reassess:\n  - Ensure that there aren\u2019t any holes that have become accessible from the newly created position.\n  - Identify the next best route toward the goal that avoids hazards.\n\n- **Utilize Obstacles Wisely**:\n  - If the boulders or boxes become accessible after the move, investigate whether they can be leveraged to either protect against holes or to create new safe pathways toward the goal.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Always Monitor Hazards**: As you plan each move, stay alert to the locations of the holes and walls to avoid getting trapped.\n- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to alter your strategy based on the outcomes of each action and the changing landscape of the game as you progress.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe primary goal is to successfully navigate the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards. By pushing the boulder left or exploring other safe movements, you will maximize safety while moving toward the objective.\n\nThis structured approach will enable the avatar to effectively navigate through the level while avoiding dangers, optimizing the chances of success.

This could potentially block one of the holes if it\u2019s adjacent or create a clearer pathway toward future movements.\n   - **Down movement** with the boulder should only be considered if it directly results in an arrangement that moves closer toward safety from hazards.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **Reassess After the Move**:\n   - After pushing the boulder, check the available tiles adjacent to the new boulder position. Identify potential future moves that either lead closer to the goal or allow safe movement downward.\n\n- **Utilize Boulders and Boxes**:\n   - If the boulder needs further interaction after being moved, look for opportunities to push it into hazardous areas (the holes) to block them and create a safer passage around the grid.\n   - Always consider whether pushing a boulder will inadvertently lead into a harmful area.\n\n### Continuous Assessment and Adaptability\n- **Monitor Hazards**: Continuously be aware of the holes and any new positions that might become available after manipulating environment elements.\n- **Plan Each Step**: Always plan two or three moves ahead to avoid getting into unsafe configurations around hazards or dead-end walls.\n\n### Overall Goal\nThe main objective is to safely reach the goal while avoiding hazards. By pushing the boulder and taking advantage of the current layout, the avatar can manipulate its surroundings effectively, opening up further strategic pathways to the goal.\n\nThis strategic approach focuses on maximizing safety while enabling movement toward the goal. Stay alert to your surroundings, and adjust your strategy as the positions of hazards and obstacles change!\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

The only available move is to interact with nearby boulders or push them to create a path.\n   - Identify any nearby boxes or boulders that can be pushed to effectively block hazards or create safe pathways.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Avoid any movements that would lead into a hole. If the immediate space surrounding the avatar offers no safe options going down, focus on lateral movements or pushing boulders.\n\n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - Since a boulder is directly next to the avatar, consider pushing this boulder to create blockages for hazards or open paths leading toward the goal.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Boulder Upward**:\n   - If it\u2019s allowed by the game rules, push the boulder upward into the space directly above it (if applicable). This creates a buffer against the wall and opens the tile for potential further explorations.\n   - **If the upward push isn\u2019t an option**, consider pushing the boulder right to clear pathways or block a hazard.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After the Move**:\n   - Assess the avatar\u2019s new surroundings to identify new potential safe moves\u2014be it upward, left, or an alternate route toward the goal.\n   - Check if any tiles now allow for further downward movements or lateral explorations that circumvent the holes.\n\n- **Explore Other Obstacles**:\n   - If pushing the boulder opens up new tiles, ensure to examine those to create a path back toward the goal while maintaining safety from hazards.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Ongoing Hazard Awareness**: Be vigilant about monitoring any holes and ensure that each move keeps the avatar a safe distance from hazards.\n- **Flexibility and Adaptation**: Continuously evaluate the position and adjust your strategy based on newly available pathways or obstacles encountered.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe primary goal is to navigate successfully to the goal while avoiding hazards. By interacting with the boulders and pushing them strategically, the avatar can create new paths, ensuring steady progress toward the objective.\n\nThis strategic approach will enable effective maneuvering through the level, maximizing the chances of safely reaching the goal while minimizing risks posed by hazards.

Upward movement may not be possible depending on the layout of the grid.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Since moving down leads into a hole, the avatar needs to avoid this. Any movement must ensure safety from immediate hazards.\n\n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - The boulders can be pushed to create new paths or blocks against hazards. Carefully evaluate their placement and any potential impacts on surrounding tiles to minimize risk.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Boulder Right**:\n   - Move the avatar to the right into the boulder, pushing it if that is feasible. This utilizes the boulder to clear the space and might help block access to the holes directly below.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **Reassess Surroundings After the Move**:\n   - After pushing the boulder, determine if there are any newly opened paths or if safe downward movement becomes available that allows access to the goal.\n   - Identify if there are other boulders or boxes that can be manipulated for further safety or progression.\n\n- **Check the Path to the Goal**:\n   - Monitor the availability of tiles leading down to the goal after the boulder's new positioning. Make sure there are no immediate hazards (holes) in the tile pathway.\n\n### Continuous Assessment and Adaptation\n- **Constantly Monitor Hazards**: Keep track of all holes in the vicinity and ensure that any subsequent moves do not lead to an immediate collision with them.\n- **Adapt Strategy Based on New Information**: As each move reveals new parts of the grid, be prepared to reassess the plan and consider different strategies for navigating around obstacles and reaching the goal.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe main goal is to navigate through the level safely and reach the goal without falling into hazards. By intelligently manipulating the boulders and utilizing the current layout, the avatar can maximize its chances of success while minimizing risks.\n\nThis approach will help ensure that the avatar can navigate effectively, adaptively reacting to new challenges as they arise.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

This is essential for advancing toward the goal safely.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Boulder Right**:\n   - Move to the right and push the boulder into the adjacent tile (if that move is possible and safe). This can help block holes directly below and free up the layout for further movements.\n   - Alternatively, if there is another boulder that can be pushed safely into a beneficial position, consider that as an option.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **Reassess the New Position**:\n   - After moving the boulder, evaluate the surrounding tiles again to identify any changes in available moves. Ensure that pushing the boulder did not create a new hazard.\n   - Check if the path down becomes accessible due to the new configuration provided by the boulder.\n\n- **Plan New Routes**:\n   - After pushing the boulder, consider if you can create a safe route down toward the goal. The configuration of holes needs constant reevaluation in future moves.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Monitor Hazards and New Tiles**: As the avatar interacts with elements, reassess the safety of tiles around the avatar to avoid any unexpected hazards.\n- **Adapt Your Strategy**: Stay flexible to modify strategies based on how the game layout continues to unfold with each movement.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe primary aim is to navigate toward the goal while ensuring safety from hazards. By pushing the boulder to the right (or utilizing it effectively), the avatar can create a more manageable space to explore and reach the goal safely.\n\nFollowing this approach will facilitate optimal navigation through the level while maximizing the chance of success.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Moving down is not an option due to the holes.\n   - The only viable action is to interact with the boulders to either block hazards or open pathways.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Ensure that any movement does not lead the avatar into a hole. Thus, focus on leveraging the boulders effectively to maintain a safe path.\n   \n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - Examine the adjacent boulders to determine if they can be pushed to block the holes or create a safe path toward the goal.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Boulder Upward**:\n   - If there is space available, push the boulder upward (if such a move is permissible by the game mechanics). This can help create a barrier against holes and make future paths safer.\n   - If moving the boulder upward is not an option, consider pushing one of the boulders to the right to potentially block holes below.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After Moving the Boulder**:\n   - Reassess the surrounding tiles after the boulder has been pushed. Identify if any safe paths to the goal have now become accessible.\n   - Look for any opportunities to push the remaining boulders or boxes to further clear the path or create barriers against hazards.\n\n- **Maintain Watch on Hazards**:\n   - Constantly monitor the positions of the holes to avoid falling into them during subsequent movements.\n\n### Continuous Assessment and Adaptability\n- **Stay Flexible**: Each move should be re-evaluated based on the new configuration of the environment after the boulder is moved. Adjust plans as needed to maximize safety and path options toward the goal.\n\n- **Monitor Surroundings for Changes**: After each move, check if new paths open up or if hazards change position, leading to new strategy considerations.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe main goal is to navigate successfully to the goal while avoiding falling into hazards. By strategically moving the boulder, the avatar can create safer pathways, thus increasing the chances of reaching the goal without harm.\n\nThis strategic framework emphasizes safe navigation and the effective use of available elements in the environment. Each step should be taken with caution, ensuring that the avatar remains safe while working toward the objective.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

The focus should be on creating a safe path or blocking holes with the boulders.\n\n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - The boulders can be used strategically to create barriers against hazards or clear pathways leading toward the goal.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Left Boulder Up or Down (if applicable)**:\n   - If the upward path is unblocked, push the left boulder upward. This will:\n     - Potentially block any hazards introduced by the holes and may provide a better option for future movements.\n   - If the upward path is not valid, consider pushing the adjacent right boulder to strategically clear pathways.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After the Boulder Move**:\n   - Reassess the surrounding tiles and environment after moving a boulder:\n     - Identify new path options that may lead to the goal based on the new configuration.\n     - Gather information on whether downward movement is now safe.\n\n- **Engage Other Nearby Obstacles**:\n   - If additional boxes or boulders are accessible in future moves, check if they can aid in further protecting the avatar from hazards.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Monitor Hazards Continuously**: Be vigilant about the holes\u2019 positions to ensure that the avatar does not navigate into them during subsequent moments.\n- **Be Ready to Adapt**: Each action may change available paths and options. Being flexible with the strategy is key to navigating effectively.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe main goal remains to navigate safely toward the goal while avoiding hazards. By pushing the left boulder strategically (either upward or manipulating a right boulder), the avatar is positioning itself to create a safer path toward achieving the objective.\n\nThis strategy emphasizes careful navigation, using the environment effectively, and ensuring safety to reach the goal.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

The only actionable options involve manipulating nearby boulders.\n- **Goal Location**: The goal is directly below a column of holes which requires careful navigation to reach without falling into any hazards.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Assess Immediate Movement Options**:\n   - Since downward movement is impossible due to the hazardous hole, determine which boulder can be manipulated to facilitate safe navigation toward the goal.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Avoid any movement that could lead the avatar into the hole. Focus on creating a path that allows progress toward the goal without falling into hazards.\n\n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - The boulders in close proximity can be effectively used to either block holes or open up new pathways. Pushing a boulder strategically is crucial for safety.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Right Boulder Down**:\n   - Moving to the right and pushing the adjacent boulder downward (if the tile below the boulder is clear of holes) should be the next step. This move:\n     - May block a hole and clear a path for future movements toward the goal.\n     - Creates a safer environment for subsequent actions.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After Moving the Boulder**:\n   - Reassess the grid configuration after moving the boulder. Identify any previously blocked paths that become available due to the new position of the boulder.\n   - Check if any new safe opportunities to move down toward the goal have emerged as a result of the boulder's movement.\n\n- **Engage Other Nearby Obstacles**:\n   - If boxes or additional boulders are accessible after moving the first boulder, analyze how they can further assist in creating safe pathways toward the goal.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Monitor Hazards**: Be continuously aware of holes and walls so that the avatar avoids falling into hazards during movement.\n- **Be Adaptable**: Stay ready to change strategies based on the outcomes of your movements and the new configurations of the environment.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe aim is to navigate the avatar to the goal without falling into hazards. By pushing the boulder down strategically, the avatar can create safer pathways and enhance the chances of successfully reaching the goal.\n\nThis strategic framework emphasizes effective navigation and interaction with the game environment while maximizing the chances of success.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Use boulders to create barriers or clear pathways.\n\n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - The boulders can either be used to block holes or to create pathways that allow for the movement toward the goal.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Right Boulder Upward**:\n   - Move the avatar to the right to push the adjacent boulder upward if there\u2019s an open space above. This way, the boulder may block a hole directly beneath it.\n   - If pushing upward is not possible, consider alternatively pushing the boulder to the right if it can be used to create a barrier.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After Pushing the Boulder**:\n   - Reassess the environment after pushing the boulder to check if any new safe paths toward the goal have opened up.\n   - Determine whether it\u2019s now possible to move down or if you can move left to create new opportunities.\n\n- **Explore Other Nearby Obstacles**:\n   - If other boulders or boxes are in range, evaluate how they can provide further aid in creating safe pathways.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Monitor Holes and Hazards**: Continue to keep an eye on hole placements to ensure that subsequent movements remain safe.\n- **Flexibility and Adaptation**: Each executed move may change the avatar\u2019s opportunities, requiring a reevaluation of paths.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe goal is to navigate successfully to the goal without falling into hazards. By pushing the boulder upward (or effectively moving it right if that\u2019s a valid option), the avatar can create safer pathways, leading to increased chances of reaching the goal.\n\nThis structured approach will help ensure effective navigation, considering risk and strategic positioning.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind.

Players likely control an avatar navigating a level filled with obstacles, hazards, and puzzles that require specific interactions to achieve the goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprite types (walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals), each with specific interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with different sprites in a variety of ways (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, being killed by lasers).\n   - The mechanics heavily involve pushing and managing the placement of boxes and boulders to navigate the level efficiently.\n   - Hazards, like lasers and holes, represent significant threats that must be avoided.\n3. **Avatar Movement**: Movement is implied to be grid-based, common in many puzzle/platform games, where the avatar can navigate through spaces created or altered by player actions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite - represented by the 'goal' sprite - while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar gets killed (by lasers or falls into a hole), resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and the goal. Understanding the level design will help you plan your movement and interactions more effectively.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be mindful of the lasers and holes. Avoid moving into their paths and strategize around them. Utilize the \u2018stepBack\u2019 mechanic when you encounter walls to better position yourself.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Since boxes can shield the avatar from frontal attacks from lasers, use them strategically to create safe paths. Players should also be cautious when manipulating boulders, ensuring they do not unintentionally cause hazards.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Boulders and other sprites can interact in a way that may create new pathways or clear obstacles. Experiment with these interactions to solve parts of the level, especially where multiple interactions can lead to desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Boulder Advantage**: Be aware of how to use the boulders to attract the gaze of the avatar for effective movement through tight spots, and learn how to manipulate them to your advantage without risking your own movements into hazardous areas.\n\n6. **Timing and Precision**: Given the presence of lasers and potential deadly interactions, take time while navigating to avoid rushing, making movements and interactions methodically to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Score Management**: While the main objective is to reach the goal, keep score changes in mind. Certain interactions could provide advantages if you're aiming for higher scores; avoid unnecessary risks while securing those points.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the challenges presented by the level layout, successfully reach the goal sprite, and ensure their survival against the hazards they encounter.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\nboulder -> 'h'\nbox -> 'l'\ngoal -> 'w'\nhole -> 'i'\nlcright lright -> 'j'\nlright -> 'k'\nwall -> 'm'\nboulderm -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nmh.m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mjkkkkkkm\nm..m...h.......mjkkkkkkm\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm.am......m..........iim\nm.hm......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=2, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nBased on the current state of the game and provided mechanics, here\u2019s a high-level strategy for the avatar\u2019s next move aimed at navigating towards the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Current State Overview\n- **Avatar Position**: The avatar is positioned next to walls, with a hole directly below, making downward movement impossible.\n- **Movement Limitations**: The left and right movements are blocked by walls, limiting the movement options significantly.\n- **Nearby Obstacles**: The avatar has access to several boulders and a box that can be manipulated.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Assess Immediate Movement Options**:\n   - Determine if the avatar can push a boulder to either open a new path or block hazards (holes).\n   - Since the immediate movement options are restricted, focus on how to create safe routes for future movements.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - The avatar needs to avoid falling into holes, which means any move must either create barriers against these hazards or open pathways without risking life.\n\n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - The boulders are key components to manipulate for solving the level. \n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Left Boulder Right**:\n   - Move the avatar to push the adjacent **left boulder** to the right. This strategy will:\n     - Block one of the holes if positioned correctly, creating a safer layout.\n     - Potentially clear a pathway for forward movement in future turns.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **Reassess Surroundings After Moving the Boulder**:\n   - After moving the boulder, reassess the grid for potential safe paths that may now become accessible toward the goal.\n   - Check if moving down (previously blocked by holes) has now become feasible due to the boulder's new position.\n\n- **Explore Other Nearby Elements**:\n   - Assess if other boulders or boxes can be utilized to further enhance safe navigation toward the goal.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Monitor Hazards Constantly**: Keep track of the hazard positions to ensure future movements do not lead to holes.\n- **Adaptability**: Be prepared to change the strategy based on new pathways or configurations revealed after each move.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe primary goal is to successfully navigate towards the goal while avoiding holes. By pushing the left boulder to the right, the avatar can create a safer environment that allows for eventual progress toward the goal.\n\nThis strategy emphasizes effective environmental interaction and careful navigation.

The hole directly below represents an immediate hazard.\n- **Movement Limitations**: The left and right movements are blocked by walls, and the downward movement leads to a hole. \n- **Nearby Elements**: The boulders nearby can be pushed to facilitate safe navigation.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Assess Immediate Movement Options**:\n   - The avatar cannot move downward due to the hole.\n   - The next viable options are limited to pushing the boulder or looking for upward movement.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safety**:\n   - Any movement should prioritize creating pathways away from the holes and other hazards while opening up routes toward the goal.\n  \n3. **Utilize Nearby Elements**:\n   - The boulders are essential to manipulating the game state; they can be used to block holes or create clear paths.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n1. **Push the Right Boulder to the Right**:\n   - Move to the **right** and push the boulder to the right into the next space (if it is empty). Pushing to the right can:\n     - Help secure the area against the hazard below.\n     - Open a new path for future movements toward the goal, leading to safer navigation options.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\n- **After Moving the Boulder**:\n   - Reassess the surrounding area to determine if any new pathways have opened towards the goal. Check the new tile layout carefully to see if any safe paths now lead downward.\n   - Evaluate if the holes are successfully blocked by the newly positioned boulder, allowing safe moves in upcoming steps.\n\n- **Engage Other Nearby Elements**:\n   - Look to see if other boulders can be used to further manipulate pathways or if boxes are available that can provide additional protective coverage.\n\n### Continuous Assessment\n- **Monitor Hazards**: Keep a careful eye on the location of holes and ensure that every move maintains a safe distance from them.\n- **Be Flexible**: Each change in the grid after moving will provide new opportunities or hazards; maintain flexibility in strategy for adapting to these changes.\n\n### Overall Objective\nThe main goal is to navigate successfully to the goal without falling into any hazardous holes. By strategically pushing the boulder, the avatar has a better chance of blocking hazards and creating viable paths toward the objective.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the avatar can effectively navigate through the level while optimizing interactions with the game environment.
