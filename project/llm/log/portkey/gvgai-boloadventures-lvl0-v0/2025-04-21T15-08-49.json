The environment surrounding the avatar has changed considerably since the last state. Walls now completely enclose the level with only the path inside accessible. There are nearby boxes represented by `*` that can be interacted with, while the avatar is also surrounded by walls `b`, which means movement towards certain directions is no longer feasible.\n\n**Surrounding Elements:**\n- The nearest item to interact with is a box (`*`) located at (11, 2) or (10, 2). \n- There are numerous hazards and potential paths obscured by walls.\n\n### Strategic Focus\nIn this state, interacting with the box will provide an opportunity to either create a barrier from hazards or clear an obstructed path. Since the current layout restricts movement options due to walls, pushing the box could help further advance towards the goal.\n\n1. **Identify Interaction Options:**\n   - Focusing on the box allows for potential blockage of lasers or navigating through the environment by manipulating objects effectively.\n\n2. **Assess Hazards and Routes:**\n   - With only a couple of boxes available, employing these strategically becomes vital to prevent harm from nearby lasers. The goal should be to dissect threats while progressing towards the eventual win condition.\n\n3. **Optimization for Success:**\n   - Utilizing the box's potential allows for creating conditions that favor safer navigation within the limited remaining space and maneuvering towards the goal.\n\n### Implementation\n\nTo efficiently progress within the game state, the avatar should interact with the nearest box to potentially create a protective barrier or open up more paths conducive for reaching the objective.\n\n```**Interact with the box (*) to create a blockage or open pathways for safer navigation towards the goal, maximizing protection from lasers.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The player must navigate through the level while avoiding hazards and leveraging the environment (specifically boxes and boulders) to reach it.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by reaching the goal (score change of 5).\n- The player loses if the avatar is eliminated, which can happen either by coming into contact with lasers (foremost) or holes.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Environmental Awareness:**\n   - Understand and manipulate the objects in the level to form protective barriers against lasers and navigate around hazardous areas.\n\n2. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Always be aware of the orientation of the lasers and approach them cautiously. Use available objects (like boxes) to shield the avatar from laser attacks.\n\n3. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Before making a move, assess the environment for potential hazards and optimal routes to the goal. Avoid moving into walls or directly into laser paths.\n\n4. **Box and Boulder Utilization:**\n   - Use boulders and boxes strategically to push or clear a path to the goal, but be careful of how they interact with other sprites. For example, ensure that they don't lead to unintended deaths by falling into holes.\n\n5. **Destruction Mechanics:**\n   - Recognize when and how using explosives (represented by boulders or laser interactions) can clear paths or eliminate threats.\n\n6. **Conservation of Moves:**\n   - Since the avatar has limited lives (SpriteCounter for avatar), plan each move carefully and avoid unnecessary dangers. \n\n7. **Goal Identification:**\n   - Always have the goal in sight and plan your route to it while navigating the level\u2019s obstacles efficiently.\n\nBy applying these strategies while navigating the game's mechanics, the player can make informed decisions that help in successfully completing the puzzles while avoiding hazards and optimizing their path to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

This constrained environment necessitates careful interaction with the boxes to enable further advances toward the ultimate goal at (1, 20).\n\n**Surrounding Elements:**\n- The boxes (`*`) are the key elements that the avatar can interact with, providing potential to block hazards (such as the lasers represented by `@`) or create pathways towards the goal.\n- The closest lasers are located directly above, threatening the avatar unless protective measures are taken.\n\n### Strategic Focus\nThe next action should be to manipulate one of the nearby boxes in a manner that either blocks incoming threats or facilitates movement towards the goal. \n\n1. **Identify Interaction Options:**\n   - Both boxes (`*`) can be moved; however, one should be prioritized based on its potential effectiveness in altering the environment.\n\n2. **Assess Hazards and Routes:**\n   - Using one of the boxes to block the path of the lasers is crucial. This can significantly mitigate the immediate danger and open routes for continued movement.\n\n3. **Optimization for Success:**\n   - The chosen box should be positioned strategically to maximize protection from the lasers while also paving a clearer path toward the goal.\n\n### Implementation\n\nTo ensure the avatar can continue to navigate safely and effectively toward the goal, the strategy will focus on interacting with one of the boxes.\n\n```**Interact with the box (*) to create a barrier against the lasers above or to open a path towards the goal effectively.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The only options for interaction available to the avatar are two boxes (`*`) positioned at (10, 2) and (9, 2). This constraint highlights the necessity to use these boxes strategically to progress within the level.\n\n**Surrounding Elements:**\n- The lasers (`@`) threaten the avatar from above, making it essential to manipulate one of the boxes to either block these lasers or create a safer path to the goal.\n- The goal is located much further along the right side of the screen, emphasizing the need to create a pathway that facilitates movement without direct contact with hazards.\n\n### Strategic Focus\nThe immediate strategy should involve manipulating one of the boxes to create either a shield against the lasers or a passage toward the goal. \n\n1. **Identify Interaction Options:**\n   - The closest box at (10, 2) or (9, 2) should be prioritized based on its potential to block or redirect the lasers.\n\n2. **Assess Hazards and Routes:**\n   - Blocking the lasers with a box will minimize risk and could allow the avatar to move safely in future turns. It\u2019s important to determine which box can best serve this purpose without creating new hazards.\n\n3. **Optimization for Success:**\n   - The goal is to optimize the movement of one of the boxes in such a way that it maximizes the avatar\u2019s safety while also setting up effective routes towards the goal.\n\n### Implementation\n\nTo navigate through the hazards and effectively push toward the goal, the focus should be on the nearest box and how to utilize it defensively.\n\n```**Interact with the box (*) at (10, 2) to create a barrier against the lasers or to establish a clearer path toward the goal, ensuring safety from immediate hazards.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."
