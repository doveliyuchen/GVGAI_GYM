It involves moving an avatar within a 2D space, interacting with different types of objects (walls, boxes, holes, laser cannons, and hazards), and solving spatial puzzles to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are several sprites with distinct roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Ground, Walls, Holes, and Goals**: Static environment elements.\n   - **Boxes and Boulders**: Movable objects used to solve puzzles.\n   - **Lasercannon and Laser**: Dynamic hazards that can harm the player (the avatar) based on orientation.\n  \n2. **Interactions**: Different interactions between sprites trigger specific game actions, such as:\n   - The avatar can be harmed or transformed by lasers and boulders.\n   - Boxes can act as shields from lasers or bounce the avatar back.\n   - The goal is to reach the designated endpoint (`goal` sprite) while avoiding hazards.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**: The player wins by reaching the `goal` sprite while avoiding losing all their avatar sprites.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, manipulate the movable objects (boxes and boulders), avoid hazards (lasers, boulders), and reach the `goal` sprite to win. The player can earn score points during gameplay, particularly by eliminating threats or reaching the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the number of avatars decreases to zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Familiarize with the Level Layout**: Start by studying the level layout to understand where you can move, where hazards are located, and the positioning of boxes and boulders.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**: Use boxes strategically to shield yourself from lasers and to block or redirect the boulders. Position boxes to use them effectively against frontal laser attacks.\n\n3. **Managing Hazards**: Stay aware of the laser cannon orientations. You may need to time your movements to avoid laser blasts, especially when moving between boulders or boxes.\n\n4. **Control Movement with Interactions**: Pay attention to gravitational interactions, like bouncing back or being forced to step back when colliding with walls or certain objects. Make strategic moves to keep the avatar safe while navigating towards the goal.\n\n5. **Maximize Points**: While reaching the goal is crucial, part of the strategy can also involve eliminating additional hazards (if possible) to maximize the score.\n\n6. **Be Cautious with Boulders**: When interacting with boulders, make sure you understand the consequences of those interactions. Some might be harmful depending on your positioning.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: If something doesn't work, analyze the failures. Understanding the mechanics helps in solving the puzzles more efficiently.\n\nUse these strategies collaboratively to navigate through each level successfully, ensuring to balance offense (gaining points) and defense (protecting the avatar from hazards).\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

It involves moving an avatar within a 2D space, interacting with different types of objects (walls, boxes, holes, laser cannons, and hazards), and solving spatial puzzles to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are several sprites with distinct roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Ground, Walls, Holes, and Goals**: Static environment elements.\n   - **Boxes and Boulders**: Movable objects used to solve puzzles.\n   - **Lasercannon and Laser**: Dynamic hazards that can harm the player (the avatar) based on orientation.\n  \n2. **Interactions**: Different interactions between sprites trigger specific game actions, such as:\n   - The avatar can be harmed or transformed by lasers and boulders.\n   - Boxes can act as shields from lasers or bounce the avatar back.\n   - The goal is to reach the designated endpoint (`goal` sprite) while avoiding hazards.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**: The player wins by reaching the `goal` sprite while avoiding losing all their avatar sprites.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, manipulate the movable objects (boxes and boulders), avoid hazards (lasers, boulders), and reach the `goal` sprite to win. The player can earn score points during gameplay, particularly by eliminating threats or reaching the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the number of avatars decreases to zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Familiarize with the Level Layout**: Start by studying the level layout to understand where you can move, where hazards are located, and the positioning of boxes and boulders.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**: Use boxes strategically to shield yourself from lasers and to block or redirect the boulders. Position boxes to use them effectively against frontal laser attacks.\n\n3. **Managing Hazards**: Stay aware of the laser cannon orientations. You may need to time your movements to avoid laser blasts, especially when moving between boulders or boxes.\n\n4. **Control Movement with Interactions**: Pay attention to gravitational interactions, like bouncing back or being forced to step back when colliding with walls or certain objects. Make strategic moves to keep the avatar safe while navigating towards the goal.\n\n5. **Maximize Points**: While reaching the goal is crucial, part of the strategy can also involve eliminating additional hazards (if possible) to maximize the score.\n\n6. **Be Cautious with Boulders**: When interacting with boulders, make sure you understand the consequences of those interactions. Some might be harmful depending on your positioning.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: If something doesn't work, analyze the failures. Understanding the mechanics helps in solving the puzzles more efficiently.\n\nUse these strategies collaboratively to navigate through each level successfully, ensuring to balance offense (gaining points) and defense (protecting the avatar from hazards).\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.
