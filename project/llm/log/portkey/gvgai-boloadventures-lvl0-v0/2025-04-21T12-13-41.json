Key mechanics include:\n\n- **Movement and Navigation:** The 'avatar' can move across the 'ground', navigate through obstacles (walls, boxes), and must avoid certain lethal elements (lasers, boulders).\n- **Object Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can manipulate 'boxes' to shield from lasers and bounce off walls.\n  - 'Boulders' can transform into different states (boulderm) depending on interactions with other objects (e.g., walls, avatar).\n  - Lasers can kill the avatar if hit, depending on position (frontal/non-frontal).\n- **Game Environment:** There are movable and immovable sprites, with 'walls' and 'holes' acting as barriers or deadly traps.\n- **Score Mechanics:** Different interactions yield score changes: reaching the 'goal' provides significant points, while death through hazards can result in loss.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the 'avatar' to the 'goal' (which is marked as \"g\") while avoiding hazards. Success is defined by reaching the goal (win condition) while navigating various obstacles and enemies along the way. The game includes a score mechanism, suggesting that players may also aim for a high score based on the interactions they engage in, such as successfully avoiding death or killing enemies.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win condition:** The player wins (score changes to 5) upon reaching the 'goal'.\n- **Loss condition:** The player loses if the 'avatar' is eliminated (SpriteCounter for the 'avatar' reaching limit 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion:\nA successful strategy for navigating the game may include the following components:\n\n1. **Analyze the Layout:** Carefully observe the level structure, identifying safe paths and potential traps. The layout suggests that there are several walls and boulders that can block or redirect movement.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Effectively:** Utilize 'boxes' to shield from lasers and create a safe pathway. Consider the placement of boxes to protect against potential boulder interactions.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of 'laser' sprites while navigating, especially by positioning the avatar to avoid frontal confrontations, as they result in immediate death.\n\n4. **Engage with Boulders Wisely:** Interacting with boulders may offer opportunities for transformation or advantageous positioning. Be mindful of how boulders may move or change state with interactions.\n\n5. **Prioritize the Goal:** Always keep focus on reaching the 'goal' at the end of the level. Plan your path to avoid unnecessary interactions that could lead to player loss.\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions:** Since the game seems to have dynamic interactions (like transform, kill, step back), experimenting with these interactions could yield different outcomes. test different action combinations to understand how they affect the surrounding environment.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, the player should be able to navigate the level effectively, solve the environmental puzzles, and ultimately reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The avatar cannot move left since it is against a wall.\n2. Moves to the right are blocked by the boulder (at (10, 23)) which prevents direct access to the goal.\n3. Therefore, the immediate next move should be to interact with the boulder at (10, 23).\n\n### Strategy\nTo successfully progress towards the goal, the avatar must interact with the boulder at (10, 23) to either move it out of the way or trigger another interaction. Removing the boulder will clear the path to the goal. Since there's no other immediate strategic option available, the next step should involve moving directly into it to initiate a transformation or repositioning of the boulder.\n\n```**Move into the boulder at (10, 23) to attempt to interact with it and clear the path to the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal 'g' is two spaces to the right at (10, 24), but directly in between the avatar and the goal is a boulder located at (10, 23).\n\n**Current Observations:**\n- The avatar can\u2019t move left as there is a wall.\n- Moving right to (10, 23) is blocked by the boulder.\n- There are no boxes in immediate reach that could be interacted with to help clear the path or create some leverage.\n  \nSince the goal is just out of reach due to the boulder, the only option to progress towards the goal is to interact with the boulder at (10, 23). The interaction will depend on the game mechanics, but typically pushing or moving a boulder should either clear the path or reposition it, allowing for further movement towards the goal.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. If I interact with the boulder at (10, 23), it could either move, allowing the avatar to access the goal or trigger some other useful interaction.\n2. There are no other visible interactable items (e.g., boxes, holes, or other boulders) that can aid in overcoming the immediate blockage.\n3. If the interaction does not alter the state (due to perhaps being unable to move the boulder), the only further actions available would be to evaluate the surrounding traps or barriers that could be hindering movement.\n\n### Strategy\nTo proceed effectively, the avatar must move into the boulder at (10, 23) to attempt to interact with it. This is the only logical step available to clear the path toward the goal.\n\n```**Move into the boulder at (10, 23) to interact with it and potentially clear the way to the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the game rules provided, we can deduce several key aspects regarding genre, mechanics, objectives, and strategies.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game seems to belong to the **puzzle platformer** genre with elements of action due to the presence of a character (the 'avatar') that navigates through a level, interacts with various objects, and needs to avoid lethal hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n### Mechanics:\nThe game incorporates various interactive sprites, each with distinct properties and interactions. Key mechanics include:\n\n- **Movement and Navigation:** The 'avatar' can move across the 'ground', navigate through obstacles (walls, boxes), and must avoid certain lethal elements (lasers, boulders).\n- **Object Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can manipulate 'boxes' to shield from lasers and bounce off walls.\n  - 'Boulders' can transform into different states (boulderm) depending on interactions with other objects (e.g., walls, avatar).\n  - Lasers can kill the avatar if hit, depending on position (frontal/non-frontal).\n- **Game Environment:** There are movable and immovable sprites, with 'walls' and 'holes' acting as barriers or deadly traps.\n- **Score Mechanics:** Different interactions yield score changes: reaching the 'goal' provides significant points, while death through hazards can result in loss.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the 'avatar' to the 'goal' (which is marked as \"g\") while avoiding hazards. Success is defined by reaching the goal (win condition) while navigating various obstacles and enemies along the way. The game includes a score mechanism, suggesting that players may also aim for a high score based on the interactions they engage in, such as successfully avoiding death or killing enemies.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win condition:** The player wins (score changes to 5) upon reaching the 'goal'.\n- **Loss condition:** The player loses if the 'avatar' is eliminated (SpriteCounter for the 'avatar' reaching limit 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion:\nA successful strategy for navigating the game may include the following components:\n\n1. **Analyze the Layout:** Carefully observe the level structure, identifying safe paths and potential traps. The layout suggests that there are several walls and boulders that can block or redirect movement.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Effectively:** Utilize 'boxes' to shield from lasers and create a safe pathway.
