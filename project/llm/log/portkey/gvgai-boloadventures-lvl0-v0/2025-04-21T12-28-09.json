It is enclosed by walls (denoted by 'b'), and the only interactable item nearby is a boulder ('*') also located at (3, 11). The immediate vicinity of the avatar includes walls to the west, north, and south, limiting movement in those directions. The laser ('%') is positioned down in row 2, which is also a potential hazard the avatar must navigate around.\n\n**Item Interaction:**\nThe closest interactable item available is the boulder ('*') at (3, 11). Interacting with the boulder has the potential to either change its position or assist in some tactical maneuvering.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the current game state and the analysis of the situation:\n\n1. **Assess Immediate Hazards:**\n   - Since there are walls blocking additional movement to the north and south at (1, 11) and (3, 11), the player must navigate towards the east (to interact with the boulder).\n\n2. **Move and Interact:**\n   - Move eastward by one space to (3, 11) to interact with the boulder ('*'). This could potentially create more paths for future movement and may avoid direct hazards.\n\n3. **Utilize Interaction Outcomes:**\n   - Depending on the interaction with the boulder, evaluate the outcomes. Moving the boulder could either shield the avatar from laser hazards below or create a pathway towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan the Next Moves:**\n   - After the interaction with the boulder, reassess the environment. If a safe path opens up that leads directly toward the goal, follow it. If not, consider alternate routes to navigate around hazards.\n\n5. **Prioritize Safety and Goal Orientation:**\n   - Ensure that the avatar does not engage with the laser directly, moving cautiously based on how the boulder affects the overall state of the area.\n\nFollowing this strategy should facilitate a successful interaction with the available boulder and open avenues towards the goal while ensuring safety from hazards.\n\n```**Move east to interact with the boulder '*' at (3, 11) to create potential pathways and avoid laser hazards.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surrounding area includes potential interactable items: two boulders ('*') located at (4, 11) and (4, 12). The hazard present is a laser ('%') at (1, 11) below the avatar and at (3, 11) directly right at (2, 11).\n\n**Item Interaction:**\nThe nearest interactable item available is one of the boulders ('*') located to the east at (4, 11). Interacting with this boulder can help manage hazards and create new paths for the avatar.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the current state of the game and the analysis of the surroundings:\n\n1. **Assess the Hazards:**\n   - The avatar must avoid moving into or directly engaging with the laser at (1, 11), which can be done by focusing movement on the options to interact with the boulders.\n\n2. **Move and Interact:**\n   - Move east (to (3, 11)) and then continue to (4, 11) to interact with the boulder ('*'). This ensures that the avatar remains clear of lasers and walls.\n\n3. **Utilize Boulder Interaction:**\n   - After interacting with the boulder, the avatar may be able to reposition it in a way that creates safety or a possible pathway towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan the Subsequent Moves:**\n   - From the new position after the boulder interaction, assess the surroundings for further pathways. Evaluate if movement towards any scoring opportunities (such as holes or additional interactable items) becomes viable.\n\n5. **Keep Safety a Priority:**\n   - Throughout every action, prioritize avoiding engagement with the laser.

The surrounding area includes walls ('b') that restrict movement in several directions, particularly blocking movement upwards (to (1, 11)) and downwards (to (3, 11)). The nearest boulders ('*') are located at (4, 11) and (4, 12), which can be interacted with.\n\nThe game involves potential hazards such as lasers ('%'), which are found both directly below (at (3, 11)) and in the adjacent row. Thus, caution is necessary in avoiding direct interaction with these hazards while planning the next moves.\n\n**Item Interaction:**\nThe closest interactable item is one of the boulders ('*') located at (4, 11). Interacting with this boulder can potentially open up movement paths towards hazards and scoring opportunities.\n\n**Strategy:**\nBased on the analysis of the current state:\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - The avatar needs to be very cautious about interactions with the laser located at (1, 11). Since the wall prevents movement in the north or south direction, the only viable action is moving east towards the boulder.\n\n2. **Move and Interact:**\n   - Move east to (3, 11), then continue east to (4, 11) to interact with the boulder ('*'). This action will ensure the avatar remains safe from the lasers directly and allows for potential movement tactics.\n\n3. **Utilize Boulder Effectively:**\n   - After interacting with the boulder, assess the new layout for movement options. The interaction may create new paths or create walls blocking the laser, allowing a safer route to the area of scoring opportunities.\n\n4. **Plan Next Moves:**\n   - Depending on the outcome of the boulder interaction, the next steps should be evaluated to either move closer to the goal or find additional score opportunities while maintaining a safe distance from the laser.\n\n5. **Focus on Safety:**\n   - Always prioritize avoiding the laser hazards while optimizing the path toward the goal and making sure to remain cautious of the walls that limit mobility.\n\nFollowing this strategy enables the avatar to navigate the level effectively while minimizing hazards and managing potential scoring pathways.\n\n```**Move east to interact with the boulder '*' at (4, 11) to potentially clear a path and avoid the laser hazard at (1, 11).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
