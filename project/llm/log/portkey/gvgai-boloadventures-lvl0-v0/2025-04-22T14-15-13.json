Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The player can manipulate the environment by moving the avatar into other sprites, leading to various consequences such as bouncing, killing sprites, or transforming the avatar.\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar is subject to movement restrictions and has to navigate around walls, which can also bounce back when collided with.

Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The player can manipulate the environment by moving the avatar into other sprites, leading to various consequences such as bouncing, killing sprites, or transforming the avatar.\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar is subject to movement restrictions and has to navigate around walls, which can also bounce back when collided with. The avatar can also use boxes as shields against lasers when in the correct position.\n4. **Scoring System**: Players can gain scores through certain interactions, such as entering the goal or killing specific sprites.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective of the game is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite. Achieving this will provide a score boost (score change of +5) and change the win status.

Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The player can manipulate the environment by moving the avatar into other sprites, leading to various consequences such as bouncing, killing sprites, or transforming the avatar.\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar is subject to movement restrictions and has to navigate around walls, which can also bounce back when collided with.

Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The player can manipulate the environment by moving the avatar into other sprites, leading to various consequences such as bouncing, killing sprites, or transforming the avatar.\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar is subject to movement restrictions and has to navigate around walls, which can also bounce back when collided with. The avatar can also use boxes as shields against lasers when in the correct position.\n4. **Scoring System**: Players can gain scores through certain interactions, such as entering the goal or killing specific sprites.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective of the game is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite. Achieving this will provide a score boost (score change of +5) and change the win status.

The level grid shows walls and the layout of holes, so planning optimal paths is crucial.\n2. **Using Boxes Wisely**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from lasers and manipulate the environment to block laser paths. Be aware of the boulders' potential as both obstacles and tools to create safe paths.\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Stay clear of holes and be cautious around lasers. Learning their patterns and timing can open safe paths.\n4. **Movement Considerations**: Since the avatar cannot step through walls, ensure movements are calculated to avoid backtracking into walls and potentially cause further hindrance.\n5. **Managing Boulders and Boulderm**: Knowing when to transform the boulder into the boulderm (which attracts gaze) can create diversions or block paths that would otherwise be dangerous.\n6. **Keep an Eye on Score**: As scoring can be affected by taking specific actions, be mindful of opportunities to score and prioritize actions that will lead to a safer path toward the goal.\n\nBy employing strategic movement, environmental manipulation, and careful consideration of hazards, players can maximize their chances of successfully navigating the level to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'h'\nboulderm -> 'w'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*.@*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhh...*\n*@.*...@.......*&hhh...*\n*a.*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*.@*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhh...*\n*@.*...@.......*&hhh...*\n*a.*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 9, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 9, col = 1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Move left to (9, 0)**\n\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
