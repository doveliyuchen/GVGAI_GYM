The player's goal is to solve challenges to reach an objective while avoiding dangers.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions:**\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** Static obstacles and objectives that define the play area.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with the environment.\n   - **Box, Boulder, Boulderm:** Interactive elements that can shield, block, or harm the avatar and other sprites.\n   - **Lasercannon and Laser:** Trigger hazards that can kill the avatar if approached improperly.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with various elements in different ways (e.g., shield from laser, bounce, evoke actions like killing or attracting gaze).\n   - The game includes mechanics for movement, collision, and transformation of sprites based on interactions.\n\n3. **Score System:**\n   - The player gains points by correctly interacting with sprites (e.g., killing both boulders in a hole).\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate from the starting point (avatar's spawn) to the goal, represented by \"g\", while overcoming obstacles and avoiding hazards. The player collects points for specific interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Condition:** \n  - The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal, with a score gain of 5 points.\n  \n- **Losing Condition:** \n  - The game is lost if the avatar is \"killed\" (e.g., hit by lasers or a boulder).\n  - The game also terminates if there are no avatars left on the screen (SpriteCounter limit for 'avatar').\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Mapping the Level:**\n   - Start by mapping the level layout and identifying key obstacles and safe paths. Use visual indicators to understand where hazards (like laser paths) are located and when they are active.\n\n2. **Secure Path to the Goal:**\n   - Identify a clear route to reach the goal while avoiding direct paths to hazards. Consider using boxes as shields against lasers when necessary.\n\n3. **Utilizing Interactions:**\n   - Make use of interactions between different sprites to manage obstacles\u2014using boxes to block lasercannons or manipulating boulders to clear paths or kill other sprites for points.\n\n4. **Avoiding Projection Hazards:**\n   - Keep awareness of the different lasercannons and their firing directions. Time movements to avoid being hit by lasers when they are active.\n\n5. **Defensive Play:**\n   - Use boxes strategically; moving near them can allow for bouncing back or shielding from frontal attacks while ensuring you don\u2019t accidentally cause interactions that lead to your demise.\n\n6. **Be Cautious with Boulders:**\n   - Avoid triggering boulders unless necessary, as they pose significant risks if they interact with the avatar.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Take time to explore the level to find additional boulders that could be useful to clear paths, activate score changes, or achieve necessary objectives to progress through to the goal.\n\nBy coordinating your movements and leveraging sprite interactions wisely, a player can navigate to the goal efficiently while maximizing score opportunities.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The player's goal is to solve challenges to reach an objective while avoiding dangers.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions:**\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** Static obstacles and objectives that define the play area.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with the environment.\n   - **Box, Boulder, Boulderm:** Interactive elements that can shield, block, or harm the avatar and other sprites.\n   - **Lasercannon and Laser:** Trigger hazards that can kill the avatar if approached improperly.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with various elements in different ways (e.g., shield from laser, bounce, evoke actions like killing or attracting gaze).\n   - The game includes mechanics for movement, collision, and transformation of sprites based on interactions.\n\n3. **Score System:**\n   - The player gains points by correctly interacting with sprites (e.g., killing both boulders in a hole).\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate from the starting point (avatar's spawn) to the goal, represented by \"g\", while overcoming obstacles and avoiding hazards. The player collects points for specific interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Condition:** \n  - The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal, with a score gain of 5 points.\n  \n- **Losing Condition:** \n  - The game is lost if the avatar is \"killed\" (e.g., hit by lasers or a boulder).\n  - The game also terminates if there are no avatars left on the screen (SpriteCounter limit for 'avatar').\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Mapping the Level:**\n   - Start by mapping the level layout and identifying key obstacles and safe paths.
