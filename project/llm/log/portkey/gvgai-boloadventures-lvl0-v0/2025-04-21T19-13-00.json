It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles (walls, boulders, lasers, etc.) while manipulating different sprites to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and their Functions:**\n  - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal:** These are immovable elements defining the playable area and objectives.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that interacts with various elements.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder Types:** These are passive and missile sprites that can interact with the environment and avatar in different ways (e.g., pushing, shielding).\n  - **Lasercannon and Laser:** These sprites act as obstacles that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Several interaction rules allow different combinations of sprites to create effects (e.g., killing the avatar if it intersects with a laser, turning a boulder into a missile upon collision with the avatar).\n  - The avatar can use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from the starting point ('A') to the goal ('g') while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the environment optimally.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar, which results in a score change.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is rendered inactive or destroyed, which can happen through collision with the wall, laser, or falling into a hole.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Observe the layout for paths leading to the goal while noting the locations of the obstacles.\n   - Identify safe zones or places where the avatar can shield itself from lasers.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes actively to shield against lasers when approaching them.\n   - Stack or position boxes cleverly to redirect or obstruct lasers from hitting the avatar. \n\n3. **Movement Management:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with walls and boulders to prevent being pushed back or transformed.\n   - Carefully step back when encountering walls and plan movement to maintain space from other hazards.\n\n4. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Approach laser cannons with caution. Identify the direction they fire and only move when safe.\n   - Use spaces behind boxes to dodge laser fire while advancing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Transform and Damage Control:**\n   - Be mindful of interactions that change the state of objects (e.g., a boulder becoming a boulderm).\n   - Strategically use the boulderm to attract enemy gaze away from the avatar, allowing for safer navigation.\n\n6. **Utilize Score Mechanics:**\n   - Take advantage of score opportunities by engaging in strategic placements and actions that might also enhance progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore different routes in the initial moves to determine the most effective path to reach the goal with minimal risk.\n\nBy considering the aforementioned strategies and carefully navigating through each interaction, players can effectively maneuver the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.
