Additionally, the game has a resource management aspect, as the avatar needs to manipulate boulders and boxes to navigate the environment successfully.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal (score increases by 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (i.e., through collision with lasers or boulders) or if it is trapped.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Movement Planning**: \n   - Pay careful attention to the layout and plan movements in advance. Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls and cannons that would force the avatar backwards.\n  \n2. **Resource Manipulation**: \n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers and to create barriers/obstructions where necessary. Additionally, boxes can be used to untrap the avatar and reshape the level.\n   \n3. **Boulder Awareness**: \n   - Know when to interact with boulders, focusing on creating a path forward without getting caught by the boulders or trapped in holes.\n\n4. **Utilizing Lasers**: \n   - Be aware of the orientation of lasers.

The player seems to control an avatar, navigating through a maze-like environment filled with static obstacles (walls, holes, boulders) and dynamic threats (lasers from cannons).\n\n**Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and goals are static, providing boundaries and points of interest.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can interact with the player and other sprites, affecting movement and positioning.\n   - **Lasers**: They are potentially lethal, triggering a kill condition depending on the angle of approach (frontal or not).\n   - **Transformations**: Boulders transform into either a rolling boulder or another state upon interaction with certain other sprites, indicating a dynamic element to the environment.\n\n2. **Avatar Mechanics**: \n   - The avatar can push boxes and be affected by boulders, which means movement is strategic\u2014knowing when to push or when to step back is critical.\n   - The avatar is also vulnerable to hazards (lasers, being trapped in holes), suggesting that movement must be carefully planned.\n\n**Objective**\nThe objective of the game is to move your avatar to the goal (represented by '0'), scoring points (5 for reaching the goal). Additionally, the game has a resource management aspect, as the avatar needs to manipulate boulders and boxes to navigate the environment successfully.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal (score increases by 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (i.e., through collision with lasers or boulders) or if it is trapped.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Movement Planning**: \n   - Pay careful attention to the layout and plan movements in advance. Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls and cannons that would force the avatar backwards.\n  \n2. **Resource Manipulation**: \n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers and to create barriers/obstructions where necessary. Additionally, boxes can be used to untrap the avatar and reshape the level.\n   \n3. **Boulder Awareness**: \n   - Know when to interact with boulders, focusing on creating a path forward without getting caught by the boulders or trapped in holes.\n\n4. **Utilizing Lasers**: \n   - Be aware of the orientation of lasers.

The player seems to control an avatar, navigating through a maze-like environment filled with static obstacles (walls, holes, boulders) and dynamic threats (lasers from cannons).\n\n**Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and goals are static, providing boundaries and points of interest.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can interact with the player and other sprites, affecting movement and positioning.\n   - **Lasers**: They are potentially lethal, triggering a kill condition depending on the angle of approach (frontal or not).\n   - **Transformations**: Boulders transform into either a rolling boulder or another state upon interaction with certain other sprites, indicating a dynamic element to the environment.\n\n2. **Avatar Mechanics**: \n   - The avatar can push boxes and be affected by boulders, which means movement is strategic\u2014knowing when to push or when to step back is critical.\n   - The avatar is also vulnerable to hazards (lasers, being trapped in holes), suggesting that movement must be carefully planned.\n\n**Objective**\nThe objective of the game is to move your avatar to the goal (represented by '0'), scoring points (5 for reaching the goal). Additionally, the game has a resource management aspect, as the avatar needs to manipulate boulders and boxes to navigate the environment successfully.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal (score increases by 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (i.e., through collision with lasers or boulders) or if it is trapped.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Movement Planning**: \n   - Pay careful attention to the layout and plan movements in advance. Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls and cannons that would force the avatar backwards.\n  \n2. **Resource Manipulation**: \n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers and to create barriers/obstructions where necessary. Additionally, boxes can be used to untrap the avatar and reshape the level.\n   \n3. **Boulder Awareness**: \n   - Know when to interact with boulders, focusing on creating a path forward without getting caught by the boulders or trapped in holes.\n\n4. **Utilizing Lasers**: \n   - Be aware of the orientation of lasers. Avoid frontal approaches to lessen risk. Use the boulders and boxes as shields against laser attacks.\n\n5. **Goal Focus**: \n   - Keep the ultimate goal in mind at all times.

The player seems to control an avatar, navigating through a maze-like environment filled with static obstacles (walls, holes, boulders) and dynamic threats (lasers from cannons).\n\n**Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and goals are static, providing boundaries and points of interest.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can interact with the player and other sprites, affecting movement and positioning.\n   - **Lasers**: They are potentially lethal, triggering a kill condition depending on the angle of approach (frontal or not).\n   - **Transformations**: Boulders transform into either a rolling boulder or another state upon interaction with certain other sprites, indicating a dynamic element to the environment.\n\n2. **Avatar Mechanics**: \n   - The avatar can push boxes and be affected by boulders, which means movement is strategic\u2014knowing when to push or when to step back is critical.\n   - The avatar is also vulnerable to hazards (lasers, being trapped in holes), suggesting that movement must be carefully planned.\n\n**Objective**\nThe objective of the game is to move your avatar to the goal (represented by '0'), scoring points (5 for reaching the goal). Additionally, the game has a resource management aspect, as the avatar needs to manipulate boulders and boxes to navigate the environment successfully.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal (score increases by 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (i.e., through collision with lasers or boulders) or if it is trapped.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Movement Planning**: \n   - Pay careful attention to the layout and plan movements in advance. Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls and cannons that would force the avatar backwards.\n  \n2. **Resource Manipulation**: \n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers and to create barriers/obstructions where necessary. Additionally, boxes can be used to untrap the avatar and reshape the level.\n   \n3. **Boulder Awareness**: \n   - Know when to interact with boulders, focusing on creating a path forward without getting caught by the boulders or trapped in holes.\n\n4. **Utilizing Lasers**: \n   - Be aware of the orientation of lasers.

The player seems to control an avatar, navigating through a maze-like environment filled with static obstacles (walls, holes, boulders) and dynamic threats (lasers from cannons).\n\n**Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and goals are static, providing boundaries and points of interest.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can interact with the player and other sprites, affecting movement and positioning.\n   - **Lasers**: They are potentially lethal, triggering a kill condition depending on the angle of approach (frontal or not).\n   - **Transformations**: Boulders transform into either a rolling boulder or another state upon interaction with certain other sprites, indicating a dynamic element to the environment.\n\n2. **Avatar Mechanics**: \n   - The avatar can push boxes and be affected by boulders, which means movement is strategic\u2014knowing when to push or when to step back is critical.\n   - The avatar is also vulnerable to hazards (lasers, being trapped in holes), suggesting that movement must be carefully planned.\n\n**Objective**\nThe objective of the game is to move your avatar to the goal (represented by '0'), scoring points (5 for reaching the goal). Additionally, the game has a resource management aspect, as the avatar needs to manipulate boulders and boxes to navigate the environment successfully.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal (score increases by 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (i.e., through collision with lasers or boulders) or if it is trapped.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Movement Planning**: \n   - Pay careful attention to the layout and plan movements in advance. Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls and cannons that would force the avatar backwards.\n  \n2. **Resource Manipulation**: \n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers and to create barriers/obstructions where necessary. Additionally, boxes can be used to untrap the avatar and reshape the level.\n   \n3. **Boulder Awareness**: \n   - Know when to interact with boulders, focusing on creating a path forward without getting caught by the boulders or trapped in holes.\n\n4. **Utilizing Lasers**: \n   - Be aware of the orientation of lasers. Avoid frontal approaches to lessen risk. Use the boulders and boxes as shields against laser attacks.\n\n5. **Goal Focus**: \n   - Keep the ultimate goal in mind at all times. Avoid getting sidetracked by interactions that do not contribute to reaching the goal. Plan the path efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game is designed around strategic movement and spatial awareness. Success requires the player to think several steps ahead and anticipate consequences of interactions with the environment.
