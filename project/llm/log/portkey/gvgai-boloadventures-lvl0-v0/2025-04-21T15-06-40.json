Players control an avatar and navigate through a level filled with environmental obstacles, utilizing various sprites to solve puzzles and reach the goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** Ground, walls, goal.\n   - **Passive Objects:** Boxes and boulders that can be manipulated by the player or other sprites.\n   - **Dangerous Objects:** Lasercannons that shoot lasers, which can kill the avatar.\n   - **Avatar Characteristics:** The avatar can interact with objects in various ways, such as bouncing off boxes or being killed by lasers or falling into holes.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can be hurt by lasers unless it shields itself with boxes.\n   - Boulders can kill if they interact with holes.\n   - The goal can only be reached by the avatar, and successfully doing so yields a score change.\n\n3. **Score System:**\n   - Players gain score from specific interactions (e.g., reaching the goal, killing sprites through interactions).\n\n### Game Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards (lasers, holes) and using boxes and boulders to navigate and manipulate the environment effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the avatar touches the goal (identified in the sprite description as \"goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5\").\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if there are no avatars left on the screen (singular reference to \"SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False\").\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Objectives:** Focus on reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. The goal is the key to winning and earns significant points.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes for Defense:** Use boxes strategically to shield against lasers. Position boxes to minimize risk when moving near hazardous areas, ensuring the avatar is protected from frontal laser attacks.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders Wisely:** Interactions with boulders can lead to unintended deaths. Where possible, avoid unnecessary interactions that could transform your avatar into a boulderm.\n\n4. **Map Awareness:** Pay close attention to the level layout. Since the game features various obstacles and paths, knowing where danger lies (like adjacent walls with lasercannons) will help navigate safely.\n\n5. **Risk Management:** Avoid risky maneuvers, particularly in sections with multiple dangerous interactions (like areas with heavy lasers or boulders). Plan movements strategically to maximize survival chances.\n\n6. **Readiness to Retreat:** If encountering unexpected dangers (like lasers or falling objects), be prepared to retreat or find alternative paths instead of pushing forward recklessly.\n\nIn summary, the game's combination of puzzle-solving and platforming mechanics invites strategic thinking and precise movements to successfully advance through levels and reach the goal while managing the hazards presented.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The area at these coordinates contains various elements that can be interacted with or navigated around, including walls and items. The avatar is alongside walls and next to a few interactive elements, particularly several items present nearby.\n\n### Nearby Items\n1. **Player-controlled entities (the '@' symbols):** There are several '@' symbols around the avatar, which could potentially indicate player-controlled avatars or enemies.\n2. **Obstacles (the '*' symbols):** These typically represent walls or barriers that cannot be traversed or interacted with.\n3. **Dangerous objects (the '%' symbols):** These could signify hazards, possibly corresponding to lethal effects such as lasers, which need to be avoided.\n4. **The '&' symbol:** There are a couple of these in proximity, which suggests they could be objects that the avatar can interact with for some functionality, potentially aiding in the strategy to progress.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\nGiven the current state and position of the avatar, the optimal action is to utilize the '&' items located adjacent to its position. Engaging with these items can help the avatar fortify its defenses against lasers, potentially providing a key advantage in navigating the subsequent hazards. Moreover, engaging with these items may yield necessary resources or open new pathways that can further contribute to reaching the ultimate goal.\n\nTaking all of this into account, the strategy for the next step is to **interact with the '&' symbol, as it may provide useful items or effects that will assist the avatar in managing nearby hazards and facilitating progress towards the goal.**\n\n```**Interact with the '&' item to potentially gain resources or abilities that will aid in navigating the level's challenges while advancing towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."

This location is surrounded by walls represented by `b`, which are immovable, meaning that movement in this section is highly restricted. The avatar is situated right above a hazardous area filled with dangerous objects denoted as `%`, indicating that caution is required to avoid detrimental interactions. The available items for interaction are the `&` symbols located at (9, 2) and (9, 3), which are crucial for the next step.\n\n### Nearby Items\nThe avatar has two `&` items close by; interacting with these could provide significant advantages:\n1. **`&` (Interaction Object):** This object has the potential to yield resources or effects that can shield the avatar from hazards or assist in navigating the environment safely.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\nTo make progress while minimizing risk, the next step should involve an interaction with one of the `&` items. Engaging with the `&` item can provide the avatar with benefits that increase its survivability against the surrounding dangers, specifically those represented by the `%` symbols. This action can potentially help in mitigating or neutralizing the threat posed by these hazards, thus allowing the avatar to maneuver more safely through upcoming challenges.\n\nBy focusing on obtaining the benefits from the `&` item, the avatar can enhance its strategic position in relation to both the imminent hazards and the overall goal of reaching the end.\n\n```**Interact with the '&' item to potentially gain resources or abilities that will assist the avatar in managing nearby hazards and facilitating progress towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This location is surrounded by walls represented by the `b` characters, which create a barrier that limits movement options. The avatar is below a row filled with potential hazards (the `%` characters) and is near some interactive `&` items at (9, 2) and (9, 3). The layout indicates that the avatar cannot progress directly towards the goal and must interact with available items to mitigate risks.\n\n### Nearby Items\nThe most relevant items available for interaction are the `&` symbols located at (9, 2) and (9, 3). These items may provide important resources or effects that can enhance the avatar\u2019s ability to navigate through dangerous areas without succumbing to hazards.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\nGiven the current state of the game and the avatar's position, the best strategy is to interact with one of the `&` items. Engaging with this item can potentially yield useful effects, such as creating a temporary barrier against the nearby hazardous elements, especially the `%` symbols, or providing other benefits that facilitate safe navigation through the level. Utilizing these items effectively can help the avatar advance towards the ultimate goal while managing the risks presented by the current environment.\n\nEngaging with the `&` item not only positions the avatar favorably for the next maneuver but also plays a vital role in improving the overall chances of success as the game progresses.\n\n```**Interact with the '&' item to potentially gain resources or benefits that will help the avatar navigate nearby hazards and continue toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."
