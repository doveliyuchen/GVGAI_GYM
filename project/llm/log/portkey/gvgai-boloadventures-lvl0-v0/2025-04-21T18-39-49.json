For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

It involves strategic movement and interactions with different kinds of objects while navigating through a level layout. \n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and their Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include \u2018wall\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019, and \u2018hole\u2019 which act as obstacles or boundaries. \n   - **Passive Sprites**: Such as \u2018box\u2019 and \u2018boulder\u2019 that can be interacted with but do not move by themselves.\n   - **Missile Sprites**: These include \u2018boulderm\u2019 and \u2018laser\u2019, which are used to attack or affect other sprites.\n   - **Orientable Avatar**: The player-controlled character can roam around and interact with the environment but is subject to a series of interactions with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - There are various interactions listed that dictate how different sprites affect each other. For example, the \u2018avatar\u2019 can either bounce back, be killed, transform, or score points based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Score Changes**: The objective seems to include scoring points through interactions, particularly through reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player avatar reaches the \u2018goal\u2019, which also increases the player's score by 5.\n   - The game results in defeat if the avatar (player) reaches a state where there are no avatars left on the screen (limit = 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the \u2018avatar\u2019 to the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while navigating the obstacles posed by walls, holes, and various other sprites. Successfully reaching the goal is the immediate aim, but it is also crucial to manage interactions to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify key paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemy missiles.\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Use the \u2018box\u2019 as a protective buffer against lasers and other hostile sprites. \n3. **Plan Interactions**: Consider how various sprite interactions can clear paths or create opportunities. For example, using boulders to alter the level layout may be beneficial.\n4. **Manipulate Enemy Spawn**: If lasers or missiles are involved, knowing when and where they fire can help you avoid collisions with them. Use walls strategically to block shots.\n5. **Avoid\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.
