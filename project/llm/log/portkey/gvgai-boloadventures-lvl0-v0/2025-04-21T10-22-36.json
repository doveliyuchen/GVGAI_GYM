For instance:\n     - The `boulderm` can transform `wall`, `box`, and `boulder` into a `boulder`.\n     - The `avatar` can shield itself from lasers using boxes and can bounce forward when hitting them.\n     - Contact with the `hole` or `laser` can lead to different outcomes (death or getting killed).\n     - The `goal` sprite is a target for the avatar to reach.\n\n3. **Terminology**:\n   - **SpriteCounter**: Logic dictates win/loss conditions based on the counts of specific sprites (`avatar`, `goal`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the `avatar` to the `goal` sprite while avoiding hazards such as `lasers` and `holes`. A successful navigation to the `goal` sprite results in an increase in score and the player winning the game (score change = 5). If the `avatar` is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit = 0), the player loses.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the `goal` with the `avatar` active.\n- **Loss Condition**: The `avatar` sprite's counter reaches zero, indicating the player has lost.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigate Carefully**: Since hazards like lasers and holes can kill the avatar, careful navigation is key. Assess the movement patterns of any lasers and avoid them.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use boxes as shields against laser attacks. Position boxes strategically to block lasers and allow safe passage.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Use the relationship between boulders and holes to eliminate hazards while creating pathways. Manipulate the boulders to create gaps or move them out of the way.\n\n4. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Look ahead at the layout and predict the effects of your actions. The action of bouncing or pushing boxes can sometimes create chain reactions that either open pathways or block them.\n\n5. **Optimal Pathing**: Find the most direct route to the `goal` but stay aware of hazards. Maintain a balance between efficiency and safety when choosing paths.\n\n6. **Test Interactions**: Use the interactions between different sprites to your advantage. Experimenting with how you manipulate boulders and boxes can reveal shortcuts and safe passages.\n\nIn summary, the key to success in this puzzle-platformer is careful navigation, strategic use of blockades (boxes), and utilizing the interactions between sprites effectively to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

For instance:\n     - The `boulderm` can transform `wall`, `box`, and `boulder` into a `boulder`.\n     - The `avatar` can shield itself from lasers using boxes and can bounce forward when hitting them.\n     - Contact with the `hole` or `laser` can lead to different outcomes (death or getting killed).\n     - The `goal` sprite is a target for the avatar to reach.\n\n3. **Terminology**:\n   - **SpriteCounter**: Logic dictates win/loss conditions based on the counts of specific sprites (`avatar`, `goal`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the `avatar` to the `goal` sprite while avoiding hazards such as `lasers` and `holes`.

If the `avatar` is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit = 0), the player loses.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the `goal` with the `avatar` active.\n- **Loss Condition**: The `avatar` sprite's counter reaches zero, indicating the player has lost.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigate Carefully**: Since hazards like lasers and holes can kill the avatar, careful navigation is key. Assess the movement patterns of any lasers and avoid them.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use boxes as shields against laser attacks. Position boxes strategically to block lasers and allow safe passage.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Use the relationship between boulders and holes to eliminate hazards while creating pathways. Manipulate the boulders to create gaps or move them out of the way.\n\n4. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Look ahead at the layout and predict the effects of your actions. The action of bouncing or pushing boxes can sometimes create chain reactions that either open pathways or block them.\n\n5. **Optimal Pathing**: Find the most direct route to the `goal` but stay aware of hazards. Maintain a balance between efficiency and safety when choosing paths.\n\n6. **Test Interactions**: Use the interactions between different sprites to your advantage. Experimenting with how you manipulate boulders and boxes can reveal shortcuts and safe passages.\n\nIn summary, the key to success in this puzzle-platformer is careful navigation, strategic use of blockades (boxes), and utilizing the interactions between sprites effectively to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(y=11, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Next Step Strategy\n\nMove the `avatar` (`a`) left to position next to the `box` (`#`), preparing to push it into the hole during the next turn, and stay vigilant for any changes in the state of surrounding hazards that may affect this plan.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
