The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The immediate surroundings indicate that there is a wall directly to the left (x=0), and the space to the right (x=2) contains another wall. It appears that moving down leads to a hole at (y=13, x=1), which is dangerous for the avatar.\n\nTo the right, at coordinates (y=12, x=3), there are walls, but there is a box at (y=12, x=5). My objective is to work towards moving the avatar closer to the goal at (y=12, x=6), keeping in mind that this involves moving past obstacles and hazards.\n\nIn order to continue progressing, I need to interact with the box, which is the nearest interactable item. This will create an opportunity to push the box towards the goal area, thus moving towards my main objective.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis above, the most strategic action for the avatar would be to move towards the box located at (y=12, x=5). This will allow for further movements towards the goal, while also providing a mechanism to block additional hazards later on. \n\n```**approach the box**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Surrounding it are various walls and obstacles:\n- Directly to the left (y=12, x=0) is a wall.\n- At the right (y=12, x=2) is also a wall.\n- Below (y=13, x=1) is a hole, which is hazardous.\n- Above (y=11, x=1) is a wall.\n- The immediate goal at (y=12, x=6) can be reached by navigating through the pathway.\n\nGiven that the only interactable item in the vicinity is a box located at (y=11, x=5), my best course of action should be to focus on that box. Moving towards the box can allow for a strategic play to reach the goal.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n\nSince the box is not reachable directly from the current location due to the wall above and the walls on either side, the avatar needs to find a way to navigate around the walls and avoid the hole directly below. This means assessing movements that lead to interacting with the box while keeping an exit route towards the goal in mind.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this situation, the best move is to navigate upwards and then right to approach the box, which would facilitate pushing it towards the goal area further down the line.\n\n```**move up to (y=11, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surroundings are critical for planning the next move:\n\n- Directly left (y=12, x=0): Wall (not traversable)\n- Down (y=13, x=1): Hole (hazard, cannot move there)\n- Right (y=12, x=2): Wall (not traversable)\n- Up (y=11, x=1): Wall (not traversable)\n\nGiven these obstacles, the avatar cannot move left, down, or right due to the walls and the hole. The only available movement option is up to (y=11, x=1), but this also leads to a wall.\n\nThe goal for the avatar is to get to the goal symbol '$' located at (y=12, x=6). The nearest interactable item is located in the next row up from the avatar at (y=11, x=5), which contains a box '#'.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n\nThe avatar should move upwards to navigate past the walls. From the current analysis, the objective is to reach the box so that it can potentially be moved towards the goal area or create a pathway. However, since the avatar can't currently reach the box because of walls and hazards, the best course of action is to move upwards.\n\nSince moving up isn\u2019t immediately useful and the avatar is effectively trapped given the current state, the avatar must change tactics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the best action is to attempt an upward movement to assess the next step, even if it leads only to the wall position. It's a necessary move to open pathways in future turns.\n\n```**move up to (y=11, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surroundings consist of:\n\n- **Left (y=12, x=0)**: Wall (not traversable)\n- **Down (y=13, x=1)**: Hole (hazard, cannot move there)\n- **Right (y=12, x=2)**: Wall (not traversable)\n- **Up (y=11, x=1)**: Wall (not traversable)\n\nFrom this analysis, the avatar is essentially trapped, as there are walls on three sides and a hole below. \n\n### Goal Consideration\n\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal located at (y=12, x=6). The nearest interactable item is the box at (y=12, x=5). However, the walls prevent the avatar from moving directly to the box.\n\n### Strategy and Reasoning\n\nGiven the walls block left, right, and up movement, the avatar must find alternative pathways. However, since walls surround it entirely, the avatar is currently stuck with no movements possible to advance towards the box or goal.\n\nIn this situation, it is essential to analyze the game state further. Since all potential moves are blocked, it implies that the current state may require a re-evaluation of reachable items in the game or perhaps an acknowledgment that there may be no solution and the avatar must wait for a future turn or compute a move backwards.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nSince the avatar is completely boxed in by walls and hazards, the next strategic step must recognize this entrapment. The avatar can do nothing to change its position. The concern now is to determine if the game allows for a \"wait\" or if the game state moves persistently and will create new openings in subsequent turns.\n\nThus, the conclusion from this strategy evaluation will be:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."

The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1.

Therefore, the conclusion is:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**``` \n\nIn this state, the avatar cannot progress further until the game state changes, indicating that the player needs to re-evaluate their strategy or reset the game to find a new path forward.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him.

Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

The nearest interactable item is a box located at **(y=12, x=5)**, but the avatar cannot access it due to the surrounding walls.\n\n### Summary of Situation\n\nSince the avatar is surrounded by walls on all sides except below (which is a hole), it cannot move at all. Therefore, there are no reachable items or potential paths to the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis above, the situation remains clear: the avatar is trapped with no available actions. Thus, the conclusion is:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**```\n\nThe only possible strategy at this point is to reset the game or explore alternate routes in a previous attempt, as the avatar is immobilized in the current game setup.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the rules and level layout, this game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of **exploration** and **strategy**. The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the rules and level layout, this game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of **exploration** and **strategy**. The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

However, both items are completely unreachable due to walls blocking the adjacent movements.\n\n### Current Situation Summary\n\nThe avatar is effectively trapped:\n- There are walls on either side and above, leaving no possible moves.\n- The downward move leads directly into a hole, posing a hazard.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs there are no valid moves available and the avatar is trapped, the conclusion is:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**```\n\nThis situation signifies that the player needs to resort to resetting the game or reevaluating their previous actions since the avatar cannot progress further from its current position. The state is perceived as a dead end where no pathways exist to the goal.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the rules and level layout, this game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of **exploration** and **strategy**. The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Thus, the conclusion is:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**```\n\nThis signifies that the player has no options to proceed in the game, indicating that a reset or a reconsideration of previous moves may be necessary since the avatar is immobilized. The lack of available actions results in an impasse.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

However, both the goal and the box are unreachable because the avatar is blocked by walls.\n\n### Current Situation Summary\n\nThe current configuration shows that the avatar cannot move left, right, up, or down, rendering it completely immobilized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the avatar has no possible movements available and is totally trapped, the conclusion is:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**```\n\nThe player must either reset the game or consider a different approach, as the avatar cannot progress in its current position, indicating a dead end.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the rules and level layout, this game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of **exploration** and **strategy**. The presence of various sprites with specific interactions suggests a focus on problem-solving to navigate through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has a variety of sprites, including the avatar, obstacles (walls, boulders), items (boxes), hazards (lasers), and a goal.\n- **Movement**: The avatar is capable of interacting with the environment, moving around, and reacting to various obstacles. There are mechanics for stepping back, bouncing forward, and transforming.\n- **Interactions**: Complex interactions are prevalent, where different sprites affect each other in specific ways (e.g., boulders can kill or transform sprites, boxes can shield the avatar, lasers can kill sprites based on orientation).\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, at which point the game concludes, ideally with a positive score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal in the lowest number of moves while ensuring the avatar's survival by avoiding hazards. Points can be scored by interacting with specific sprites (e.g., transforming or destroying obstacles).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which gives a score of 5 points. \n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the avatar counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar can no longer respond to interactions) or if the avatar is killed by obstacles like lasers or by falling into holes.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are multiple interactions based on sprite placement and types, it's essential to think ahead of how moving a box or boulder will affect the avatar's path.\n2. **Use Shields Wisely**: Utilize boxes as shields to block lasers and prevent danger. Position them strategically to create safe paths.\n3. **Clear the Path**: If there is a way to transform or eliminate hazards, like boulders or lasers, you should prioritize that. Not all interactions will be beneficial, so be mindful of the consequences.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the laser direction before moving the avatar to avoid being killed. If unsure, move carefully or use the terrain to block hazards when possible.\n5. **Explore for Score**: Some interactions can increase your score. Engage with elements to maximize points before heading to the goal, especially if the opportunity to collect points exists near the goal.\n\n### Example Move Set\n1. Start by moving towards a box immediately in front of the avatar. Utilize it as a shield against hazards while assessing your next moves.\n2. If there are boulders, check the potential for interplay - can they be moved or transformed to clear a path? Push them strategically.\n3. Use the walls and holes to your advantage for redirection. If lasers are creating a barrier, manipulate boxes or boulders to create safe passage to the goal.\n4. Always visualize the interactions before executing moves to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires careful thought and planning to progress effectively, given its puzzle nature. By focusing on utilizing interactive elements thoughtfully and avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate through levels and achieve their objectives while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

However, both targets are unreachable because the walls block all movement paths.\n\n### Current Situation Summary\n\nThe avatar is completely trapped, with:\n\n- No available moves to approach the box or the goal.\n- The hazard below blocking downward movement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs the avatar has no valid moves available and is entrapped:\n\n```**no valid move available; the avatar is trapped**```\n\nThis outcome suggests that the player either needs to reset the game or reconsider their strategy, as the avatar cannot interact with any items or make progress toward the goal in its current position. This scenario represents a dead end in gameplay.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
