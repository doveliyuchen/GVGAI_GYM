Identify potential moves that can be made without immediately falling into holes or colliding with boulders.\n\n2. **Clear Paths:**\n   - Utilize boxes judiciously to clear paths. Pushing a box into a position where it can protect the avatar from lasers or create a bridge over holes is essential.\n\n3. **Boulder Management:**\n   - Avoid direct interactions with the boulders, as they can pose a risk of elimination due to their ability to harm the avatar. Instead, assess their movement dynamics to see if they can inadvertently clear a path or block hazards.\n\n4. **Direction Planning:**\n   - The avatar has limited movement options. Plan moves that progress directly toward the goal without unnecessary detours. Focus on horizontal rather than vertical movements to minimize risk.\n\n5. **Sequential Movement:**\n   - Introduce a pattern of movement where the avatar takes one step towards the goal while ensuring that each move does not leave it in a vulnerable state. Always reposition boxes for safety first when necessary.\n\n6. **Utilize Holes:**\n   - The holes can be both dangers and advantages. If a hole can be strategically navigated to avoid hazards or shorten the distance to the goal, take that path.\n\n7. **Continuously Monitor Hazards:**\n   - Keep a close watch on any moving hazards such as missiles. Anticipate their paths and plan movements accordingly to avoid contact.\n\n8. **Ending Moves:**\n   - When nearing the goal, ensure that the path to the win condition is clear. If there are lingering hazards, consider positioning boxes or using space strategically to neutralize threats.\n\n9. **Backup Plans:**\n   - Always have a secondary escape plan or maneuver ready in case of unexpected changes or hazards that could jeopardize progress toward the goal.\n\n10. **Document Progress:**\n    - As you clear obstacles and approach the goal, maintain a mental or written note of successful strategies for overcoming specific arrangements of boxes and boulders that can be referenced in future levels.\n\n### Example Movement Sequence\n1. Move left to assess the position of boulders.\n2. Push any available box left or right to shield against holes.\n3. Move vertically if a safe path opens, ensuring no collisions.\n4. Gradually close distance to the holes while avoiding unnecessary hazards.\n\nBy employing these strategic steps, the avatar can effectively navigate through the current state of the game, reducing the risk of elimination while focusing on reaching the goal efficiently.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

The spaces to the left, right, and directly above the avatar should be evaluated for walls, hazards, and opportunities for movement.\n\n2. **Clear the Right Path:**\n   - The goal is directly to the right. If the path to the right is initially blocked by a wall or hazard, consider moving the avatar left or up to identify other routes or positions to safety.\n\n3. **Utilize the Box for Safety:**\n   - If there\u2019s an opportunity to move the box away from its current position to create a pathway, make that the immediate objective. The box can potentially act as a shield against hazards.\n\n4. **Boulder Navigation:**\n   - Evaluate the position of the boulders above. If one can be pushed or maneuvered out of the way to clear a direct path to the goal, make it a priority without compromising safety.\n\n5. **Execute a Two-Step Plan:**\n   - Move the avatar away from immediate hazards (like holes) but towards the goal. If the right is blocked initially, consider moving to the left to create more options for escaping hazards and approaching the goal.\n\n6. **Be Cautious of Holes:**\n   - Ensure any planned movement does not lead the avatar into a hole. Every move should maintain at least one safe distance from hazards.\n\n7. **Check for Blocked Movement:**\n   - After moving, re-evaluate the surrounding cells to determine if any new threats (like lasers or additional holes) have become apparent or if more pathways to the goal have opened.\n\n8. **Optimize By Planning Multiple Moves:**\n   - If the first move toward the goal is not viable due to hazards, plan further ahead by determining what would be the safest alternative route while still aiming to reach the goal efficiently.\n\n9. **Final Approach to the Goal:**\n   - Once the route to the goal appears clear (after thorough navigation through holes), make the final moves towards it while ensuring no hazards are introduced in the last steps.\n\n10. **Document Lessons Learned:**\n    - After achieving movements or reaching the goal, note down strategies that worked. This documentation will aid in improving strategic decisions in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Example Movement Sequence\n1. **Evaluate Right Movement**: If safe, move right toward the goal.\n2. **If blocked**: Assess moving up or left to create a safe path.\n3. **Use Box**: If there's a box next to the avatar, move it to a position that shields against potential hazards.\n4. **Finalize to Goal**: Check that the route remains clear and move towards the goal, avoiding any immediate hazards.\n\nBy adhering to these planned strategies, the avatar can effectively navigate through the current game state while minimizing risks and aiming for the win condition.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

The immediate goal is to determine if there\u2019s a clear route to move toward the goal, avoiding hazards like holes.\n\n2. **Create a Safe Path:**\n   - If possible, prioritize moving the box to a position where it can act as a barrier against any holes or hazards. For example, if the box can be pushed upward, do so to shield against falling into a hole.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - The avatar is adjacent to several holes; thus, plan any potential movement away from them. Ensure movements do not lead to falling into holes, especially if moving right toward the goal.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulder Dynamics:**\n   - Assess if the boulders can be pushed or manipulated to create a path or blockage for the hazards. This could include moving them away from the goal or into holes, provided it does not jeopardize the avatar.\n\n5. **Execute Safe Movement:**\n   - Move the avatar right towards the goal only if the path is clear of immediate hazards and if the surrounding conditions allow for it safely. If blocked, backtrack to find alternative routes.\n\n6. **Employ a Sequential Strategy:**\n   - Given the walls and hazards, look for a step-by-step approach that brings the avatar closer to the goal:\n     - **First Move:** If there's a safe pathway available to push the box, do so first.\n     - **Second Move:** Move the avatar once the path is clear, ideally toward the goal, ensuring to avoid hazards.\n\n7. **Monitor Holes and Hazards:**\n   - As you move, keep an eye on the holes and other hazards. Anticipate any possible dangers that may arise on the next turn and adjust movement strategies accordingly.\n\n8. **Preparation for Final Approach:**\n   - If the path to the goal starts to open, prepare for the final steps toward the goal. Make sure that there are no unavoidable hazards (like holes) in the immediate next cells as the avatar closes in on the goal.\n\n9. **Backup Plan:**\n   - Always have a secondary plan in case the primary route becomes unsafe. This can include retreating to a previously safe position or finding alternative routes around the boulders and holes.\n\n10. **Post-Move Evaluation:**\n    - After each move, reassess the new conditions. Are there new holes? Have other hazards popped up? Maintain awareness to adapt to new configurations resulting from moves each turn.\n\n### Example Movement Sequence\n1. **Assess the box:** If the box is in immediate reach and can be safely moved to create a barrier against holes, do so.\n2. **Move Right if Clear:** If the immediate right position is clear of hazards, move the avatar right towards the goal.\n3. **Final Adjustments:** Ensure to navigate around any boulders or holes and prepare for the next step toward the goal once there\u2019s a viable path.\n\nBy following these strategies, the player can make calculated movements that enhance the likelihood of reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of elimination.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

For instance, positioning the box vertically (if available) can provide a shield on the left side while moving right towards the goal.\n\n3. **Plan Safe Movement:**\n   - The avatar should avoid any immediate moves that could lead to falling into holes. Consider moving one tile to the left or up to explore alternative pathways without risking direct contact with hazards.\n\n4. **Clearing a Path:**\n   - If moving the box can clear a path to the right, prioritize this. Check if the box can be pushed into a position that either blocks a hole or creates a pathway toward the goal.\n\n5. **Engage with Boulders Strategically:**\n   - Consider potential interactions with boulders that may open up clear paths. If there are boulders that can be pushed without risk, such actions should be taken with caution.\n\n6. **Focus on Final Movements:**\n   - If the direct path to the goal becomes clear (after assessing movement options), prepare to make the final moves toward the goal. Each step should avoid vulnerabilities to hazards.\n\n7. **Monitoring for Hazards:**\n   - Keep a close watch on holes and other hazards. As you move, re-evaluate the safety of the adjacent tiles, especially right before committing to a final approach to the goal.\n\n8. **Backup Options:**\n   - Have alternative routes planned in case the intended route is suddenly obstructed or a hazard appears.\n\n9. **Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Plan moves in a way that utilizes two steps; for example, first positioning a box and then moving toward the goal. This could help create more opportunities while minimizing risks.\n\n10. **Commit to Progress:**\n    - Once a pathway to the goal is secure, commit to the necessary moves needed to achieve the win condition while continuously monitoring for any unexpected hazards or obstacles.\n\n### Example Movement Sequence\n1. **Assess the Box:** Move the box left or upward if it can prevent a hazard or clear a path.\n2. **Move Up or Left:** If the area immediately to the right is blocked or hazardous, consider retracing to an earlier position to create new openings.\n3. **Approach Goal:** Once clear pathways have been established, move directly towards the goal while ensuring safety from holes and lasers.\n\nImplementing this strategy while prioritizing caution and careful evaluation of the current game state should enhance the likelihood of successfully reaching the goal while avoiding elimination.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

The interactions between the various sprites involve strategic planning and positional play, typical of puzzle-based games where players must figure out how to navigate obstacles and reach goals efficiently.\n\n---\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** Ground, walls, and holes that serve as boundaries and obstacles.\n   - **Passive Sprites:** Boxes and boulders that can interact with the avatar and may have specific characteristics (e.g., blocks can be pushed, and boulders can harm the avatar).\n   - **Missiles:** Lasers that act as hazards, possibly moving in a specific direction and posing a threat to the avatar.\n   - **OrientedAvatar:** Represents the player character, capable of movement and interactions with other sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar has several interactions defined with other elements:\n     - **Collision with walls:** The avatar will step back.\n     - **Interacting with boxes:** The avatar can use boxes as shields against lasers.\n     - **Holes:** Contact with the hole causes the avatar to step back, while interaction with the goal sprite results in a win condition and scoring points.\n     - **Lasers:** If the avatar comes into contact with a laser, it can either kill the avatar based on its direction of approach (frontal or not).\n\n3. **Goal:**\n   - The primary objective is to reach the goal sprite, which will cause the avatar to \"kill\" itself and grant a score change of +5.\n\n4. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0), resulting in a loss.\n   - The game is won when the goal sprite is no longer present (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0), indicating that the goal has been reached.\n\n---\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully reach the goal sprite with the avatar, which also provides a score of +5.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar is eliminated through collision with a laser or other harmful sprites, causing a SpriteCounter limit to drop to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Navigate Carefully:** Always be aware of the surroundings to avoid pitfalls, especially the walls and the lasers. The lasers can be fatal depending on the direction of the approach. Ensure to assess the position of any lasers before moving.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Effectively:** Leverage the boxes as shields against lasers. Move them into place strategically to provide safe passage or to deactivate laser threats.\n\n3. **Plan Movements:** The layout suggests that certain pathways may be blocked by walls; thus, planning movements in advance is crucial. Avoid making unnecessary moves that could lead to being pushed into hazards.\n\n4. **Engage Obstacles Wisely:** Avoid engaging with boulders directly; instead, try to manipulate them or navigate around them to avoid transformations that may result in losing the avatar.\n\n5. **Focus on the Goal:** Prioritize reaching the goal over exploring. While understanding the layout is essential, it\u2019s vital to ensure the path remains open to reach the exit efficiently.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can improve their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving the win condition while minimizing the risk of elimination.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb.....................%b\nb.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...@.%b\nb...@............b.@..%b\nb..b.bbbbbbbbbb.@.%....b\nb@@b...........bb...b..b\nb..b....@.@....bbb.bbb.b\nb..b.....@.....b&*.....b\nb@@b...@.......b&*.....b\nb..b...#..b%%%%...@...%b\nb..b......b..........%%b\nb.ab......b.........%%$b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Next Steps Strategy for Current State\n\n#### Current Observations\n- The avatar is located at a position near a wall, with hazards (holes) on its path toward the goal.\n- There are also boulders present that could be manipulated for safety or to clear a path.\n- The goal is directly to the right, but there's a pressing need to navigate past the holes without falling in or entering a dangerous situation.\n\n#### High-Level Strategy for Movement\n\n1. **Evaluate the Immediate Environment:**\n   - Look closely at the tiles adjacent to the avatar. Assess the potential for movement and recognize any new hazards that may affect the next steps.\n\n2. **Create Safe Pathways:**\n   - **If there\u2019s a box available**, consider moving it towards the right to create a barrier against the holes. The box can help shield the avatar from falling in and facilitate a secure lane to move toward the goal.\n\n3. **Assess and Leverage Boulders:**\n   - Identify any manageable boulders nearby. While they can pose a risk, moving them carefully could help clear a path to the goal. Push a boulder into a strategic position, such as adjacent to a hole, to block it if possible.\n\n4. **Plan Sequential Movements:**\n   - Given the restrictions due to walls and hazards, consider a stepwise approach:\n     - **First Move:** If a box or boulder can be manipulated to create space or a protective barrier, execute that first.\n     - **Second Move:** Once a safe position is established, move the avatar towards the right, planning the route just before hitting the goal.\n\n5. **Avoid Immediate Hazards:**\n   - While navigating, make sure that each potential move does not lead the avatar into immediate hazards. Be particularly cautious of the holes\u2014do not commit to a rightward move if it leads directly into one.\n\n6. **Creating Escape Routes:**\n   - Always aim to have a backup plan\u2014if the right is not safe due to changing circumstances, have a route planned to retreat safely without falling into traps.\n\n7. **Evaluate Each Move:**\n   - After every movement, take a moment to reassess the situation. Did hazards change? Is there a new path to the goal? Always ensure the avatar is not put at risk for the next potential move.\n\n8. **Focus on Closing in on the Goal:**\n   - Once the path is secured and the surrounding tiles are clear of hazards, approach the goal. If a safe maneuver to the goal is identifiable, execute it promptly.\n\n### Example Movement Sequence\n1. **Check Box Position:** If the box is available, push it to a location that will provide a barrier between the avatar and the holes.\n2. **Move Right to Secure Position:** If it's safe (there's no immediate hazard), move the avatar two spaces to the right.\n3. **Final Move to Goal:** Once a pathway to the goal appears clear and safe (after assessing the tiles), move directly towards it.\n\nIncorporating these strategies with careful observation and decision-making will enhance the likelihood of successfully reaching the goal while minimizing the risks associated with hazards.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"
