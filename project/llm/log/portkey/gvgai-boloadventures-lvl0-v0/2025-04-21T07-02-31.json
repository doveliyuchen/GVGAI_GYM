Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw.....................0w\nw.wwwwwwwwwwwwwww...c.0w\nw...c............w.c..0w\nw..w.wwwwwwwwww.c.0....w\nwccw...........ww...w..w\nw..w....c.c....www.www.w\nw..w.....c.....wr......w\nwccw...c.......wr......w\nw..w...b..w0000...c...0w\nw..w......w..........00w\nwA.w......w.........00gw\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Current State ===\n@\nc\n#\nd\n$\ne\nb\n*\nf\n%\n&\ng\n@\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Game\n\n#### Analysis of Current State\nThe current layout presents a grid of obstacles, enemies, and potential pathways that will require careful navigation. Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules, it appears that the game fits into the puzzle or platformer genre. Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\nboulder -> 'h'\nbox -> 'l'\ngoal -> 'w'\nhole -> 'i'\nlcright lright lright lright -> 'j'\nlright -> 'k'\nwall -> 'm'\nlcright lright lright lright lright -> 'n'\nlright lright -> 'o'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'p'\nlright lright lright -> 'q'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'r'\nlright lright lright lright -> 's'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 't'\nlright lright lright lright lright -> 'u'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'v'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'x'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'y'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'z'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'A'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'B'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'C'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'D'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'E'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'F'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'G'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'H'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'I'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'J'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'K'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'L'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'M'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'N'\n\n=== Last State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mCNLz...m\nmhhm...h.......mCNLz...m\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nma.m......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Current State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mCNMB...m\nmhhm...h.......mCNMB...m\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nma.m......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Game\n\n#### Analysis of Current State\nThe current layout presents a grid of obstacles, enemies, and potential pathways that will require careful navigation. Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards.

If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings.

Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards.

Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\nboulder -> 'h'\nbox -> 'l'\ngoal -> 'w'\nhole -> 'i'\nlcright lright lright lright -> 'j'\nlright -> 'k'\nwall -> 'm'\nlcright lright lright lright lright -> 'n'\nlright lright -> 'o'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'p'\nlright lright lright -> 'q'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'r'\nlright lright lright lright -> 's'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 't'\nlright lright lright lright lright -> 'u'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'v'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'x'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'y'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'z'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'A'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'B'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'C'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'D'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'E'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'F'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'G'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'H'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'I'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'J'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'K'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'L'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'M'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'N'\n\n=== Last State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mCNNNNMBm\nmhhm...h.......mCNNNNMBm\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nma.m......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Current State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mCNNNNNDm\nmhhm...h.......mCNNNNNDm\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nma.m......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Game\n\n#### Analysis of Current State\nThe current layout presents a grid of obstacles, enemies, and potential pathways that will require careful navigation. Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules, it appears that the game fits into the puzzle or platformer genre. Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\nboulder -> 'h'\nbox -> 'l'\ngoal -> 'w'\nhole -> 'i'\nlcright lright lright lright -> 'j'\nlright -> 'k'\nwall -> 'm'\nlcright lright lright lright lright -> 'n'\nlright lright -> 'o'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'p'\nlright lright lright -> 'q'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'r'\nlright lright lright lright -> 's'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 't'\nlright lright lright lright lright -> 'u'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'v'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'x'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'y'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'z'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'A'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'B'\nlcright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'C'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'D'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'E'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'F'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'G'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'H'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'I'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'J'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'K'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'L'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'M'\nlright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright lright -> 'N'\n\n=== Last State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mCNNNNNEm\nmhhm...h.......mCNNNNNEm\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nma.m......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Current State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mCNNNNNEm\nmhhm...h.......mCNNNNNEm\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nma.m......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Game\n\n#### Analysis of Current State\nThe current layout presents a grid of obstacles, enemies, and potential pathways that will require careful navigation. Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites.

Each cell contains various sprites that can impact the avatar's journey, and the goal is to reach the exit (represented as `$`) while avoiding hazards (such as lasers `*` and boulders `@`).\n\n#### Key Observations\n- **Hazardous Areas**: The presence of laser sprites (depicted by `*`) in several locations indicates potential threats that could cause the avatar to lose. \n- **Movable Objects**: The `&` symbols represent boulders and possibly other interactive objects that can be used in combination with the game\u2019s mechanics to create pathways or barriers.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal `$` is located towards the bottom right corner, accessible while navigating through a constricted space.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment**: Before moving the avatar, check the surrounding areas for imminent threats from the lasers. Avoid moving into any cell that would result in immediate damage.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely**: The boulders can block lasers or create safe spaces:\n   - Consider moving a boulder to obstruct a laser's line of fire. \n   - If any boulders can be maneuvered to create a path straight towards the goal, prioritize those moves.\n\n3. **Navigate Through Clear Spaces**: The current position of `@` (boulders or blocks) indicates potential safe spots. Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards.

Move through cells represented by `.` to maintain a safe trajectory towards the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: For every movement, consider:\n   - How many steps it will take to reach the goal while avoiding lasers.\n   - Possible interactions with boulders and other objects, such as using the current position of the avatar to push a boulder to block lasers and then move forward.\n\n5. **Constantly Check Surroundings**: Each step should be taken while assessing the surroundings. If a step places the avatar in a risk zone (adjacent to a laser), reconsider alternative routes.\n\n6. **Move Toward the Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the `$` goal at the bottom right:\n   - Plan to make strategic movements that keep the avatar as close to the path leading to `$`, while avoiding collision threats.\n   - Ensure every movement advances towards the goal while maintaining safe distance from threats.\n\n7. **Final Moves**: Once close to the goal (near the `$`), perform a last check of nearby hazards. If safe, move directly to the goal; if not, adjust your path using the boxes and boulders as needed.\n\n### Example Step Sequence\n1. Start by moving closer to any boulders to utilize them as shields.\n2. If possible, push a boulder towards a laser to create a protective barrier.\n3. Use your remaining moves to safely navigate through the clear areas towards the goal, ensuring no laser hits.\n4. Upon reaching the target area adjacent to the goal, perform final evaluations of all dangers before making the last move.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall strategy focuses on careful positioning, awareness of the interactive mechanics of the environment, and a steadfast commitment to reaching the goal while avoiding hazards. Leveraging objects in your path effectively will be crucial to success, as will maintaining alertness to changes in the board state as you progress through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Players must navigate through obstacles while manipulating various game elements to reach a goal, which is common in both genres.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, goals), a movable avatar, passive and missile objects (boxes, boulders, lasers).\n  \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with different objects in the environment, such as walls, boxes, and boulders, with various outcomes.\n   - There are mechanisms for transforming or killing sprites based on these interactions (e.g., the avatar being killed by lasers or transformed by colliding with boulders).\n   - The scoring system rewards the player for achieving objectives, especially through interactions that change states or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The player wins if they reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`).\n   - The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders. Successfully navigating through the level while managing interactions with the sprites is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: Reach the goal sprite, which gives points and signifies the end of the level.\n- **Losing**: The avatar is eliminated which leads to game over; this can occur due to collisions with lasers or specific interactions with boulders not in the player's favor.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, players should consider the following strategic points:\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout carefully before moving. Identify the safest path to the goal while avoiding obstacles and hazards.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes and Boulders**: Leverage the boxes to shield against laser attacks. Boxes can also bounce the avatar forward if they collide at the right moment. Maneuver boulders as necessary to clear paths or create barriers against lasers.\n\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others. This includes knowing which directions need to be avoided when approaching lasers to prevent being hit.\n\n4. **Navigate Space Efficiently**: Use the walls to your advantage to produce appropriate bounces or reversals if you're at risk of being struck or transformed by a boulder.\n\n5. **Stay Aware**: Keep an eye on the position of the laser cannons, as they can be significant hazards that can end the game if not respected. \n\nOverall, success in this game will depend on careful observation, strategic movement, and leverage of the mechanics provided by the sprites. Each level will require thoughtful interaction with the game environment to advance towards the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.
