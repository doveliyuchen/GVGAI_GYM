The immediate path allows for movement toward the holes and potentially towards the goal.\n   - Backtracking or navigating upward is not viable due to walls.\n\n3. **Utilize Boulders Effectively:**\n   - Given the position of boulders, consider moving towards the right after the next immediate step, as there\u2019s an opportunity to utilize one of the boulders to shield against immediate threats or to bounce towards the goal.\n   - Boulders can serve as potential obstacles for lasers if encountered, but as there are no lasers visible, focus remains on avoiding holes.\n\n4. **Plan the Move Sequence:**\n   - Move **right** to navigate away from the wall while remaining vigilant of the holes to the right. This move will allow better access to interact with the boulders.\n   - After moving right, move downwards, utilizing the space created by boulders for further navigation.\n\n5. **Avoid Pitfalls:**\n   - Stay vigilant around the holes by choosing paths that either direct away from them or provide a bounce off surfaces that minimize exposure.\n   - Ensure to plan movements that keep the avatar within safe zones (areas surrounding walls and boulders directly away from holes).\n\n6. **Engage With Goal Responsibly:**\n   - After navigating through potential hazards, reach toward the goal but ensure it's done after verifying that no hazards can interrupt.\n   - Interacting with the goal sprite provides a score change, which should be the final step after successful navigation.\n\n#### Example Move Sequence:\n1. **Move Right**: Navigate from the starting position adjacent to the wall.\n2. **Move Down**: Utilize the space with boulders to go down while putting distance from the holes.\n3. **Move Right Again**: Safely approach the goal during these movements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy methodically assessing the surroundings and planning movements to avoid threats while progressing towards the goal, the avatar will not only achieve the primary objective of reaching the goal sprite but also maximize the chances of maintaining a high score. Each step should be executed with awareness of the position of hazards, facilitating effective navigation through the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

This keeps the goal in sight and allows for continued assessment of the surrounding hazards after movement.\n\n3. **Evaluate New Position After Right Move:**\n   - Upon moving right, check for proximity to holes and the goal. Ensure that there is an immediate pathway towards the goal without adjacent hazards.\n   - If the new position shows that a hole is immediately right of the avatar after the move, further strategic decisions will need to be made.\n\n4. **Plan Next Actions Based on New Position:**\n   - If safe, **move down or further right** to proceed toward the goal. Assess the layout of holes and boulders to navigate effectively.\n   - If moving right brings the avatar next to a hole, the next logical move should be **down,** avoiding falling into the hole.\n\n5. **Utilize Boulders and Nearby Objects:**\n   - Utilize any nearby boulders as shields against holes if necessary.\n   - If there\u2019s an option to interact with a box, consider using it to shield against traps or to create a bounce effect for movement.\n\n6. **Focus on Reaching the Goal:**\n   - Prioritize moves that lead directly towards the goal while carefully monitoring the surroundings for hazards.\n   - If the avatar can reach the goal in the next moves by continually checking paths, do so while avoiding creating potential loops around hazards.\n\n#### Example Move Sequence:\n1. **Move Right:** The avatar moves from the wall into open space toward the goal.\n2. **Evaluate the position:**\n   - Check if the hole presents an immediate threat after the right move.\n3. **Next Decision:**\n   - If there are no immediate hazards, continuing to move right towards the goal should be the priority.\n   - If there is a hole, assess whether a downward move makes sense to create space from threats while still inching towards the goal.\n\n#### Feedback Loop:\n- After each move, reassess the surrounding area for new threats, adjusting the strategy accordingly.\n- Maintain a focus on both reaching the goal and never moving the avatar into a position where it could become trapped or compromised by hazards.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFocusing on cautious, strategic movements that prioritize the goal while avoiding holes creates a pathway to success. Utilize environmental elements (boulders, boxes) effectively to enhance movement possibilities and shield the avatar against unexpected threats. Each action should be calculated with the aim of advancing towards the goal while maintaining safety from hazards.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb.....................%b\nb.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...@.%b\nb...@............b.@..%b\nb..b.bbbbbbbbbb.@.%....b\nb@@b...........bb...b..b\nb..b....@.@....bbb.bbb.b\nb..b.....@.....b&*.....b\nb@@b...@.......b&*.....b\nb..b...#..b%%%%...@...%b\nb..b......b..........%%b\nb.ab......b.........%%$b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Current State\n\n#### Current Environment Analysis:\n- The avatar is currently against a wall, with holes nearby and the goal visible to the right.\n- There are multiple boulders and walls restricting movements, creating potential hazards.\n- The immediate concern is to navigate the avatar safely toward the goal while avoiding the surrounding holes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Strategy:\n\n1. **Immediate Move Decision**:\n   - Move the avatar **right** to advance towards the goal while assessing the next available moves.\n\n2. **Evaluate New Position**:\n   - After moving right, check the immediate surroundings to see if the avatar is now adjacent to any holes:\n     - If a hole is adjacent, be prepared to adjust the next move.\n     - If the path remains clear, consider continuing towards the goal.\n\n3. **Plan Next Move**:\n   - **If the path is clear**: \n     - Move **right** again to continue towards the goal.\n   - **If blocked by a hole**: \n     - Move **down** to avoid the hole and reassess the next step toward the goal. \n\n4. **Utilization of Surrounding Features**:\n   - Look for any boulders within the immediate area that could either block a hole or provide a strategic bounce to reposition effectively.\n   - If there\u2019s a box nearby, assess whether moving it could create a clear path or potentially act as a shield.\n\n5. **Continuous Hazard Management**:\n   - Keep track of the positioning of holes at all times. Each move should be carefully computed to ensure it does not lead to interaction with a hole.\n\n6. **Prioritize Overall Safety**:\n   - As the avatar gets closer to the goal, maintain a focus on how to reach it without falling into nearby hazards. Safety should take precedence over speed.\n\n### Example Move Sequence:\n1. **Move Right**: The avatar shifts one space to the right.\n2. **Evaluate Position**: Check for holes next to the new position:\n   - If there are no holes, consider moving **right** again toward the goal.\n   - If there is a hole, then **move down** to avoid it.\n3. **Decide Next Move**: After reassessing,\n   - If the next right move is safe, execute that; otherwise, adjust accordingly.\n\n### Feedback Loop:\n- After each action, promptly reassess the environment and current position to adapt strategies dynamically.\n- Employ the real-time awareness of holes and boulders to adjust navigation plans continually.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis strategy calls for careful navigation through the environment while focusing on reaching the goal effectively. By maintaining constant awareness of the hazards and planning each move strategically, players can maneuver successfully through the game, achieving their objective without falling victim to the lethal surroundings.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"
