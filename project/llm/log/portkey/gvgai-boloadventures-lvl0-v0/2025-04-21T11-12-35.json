It combines elements of spatial reasoning, interaction between various types of objects, and movement mechanics typical of platformers. The avatar navigates a level filled with obstacles and hazards while aiming to reach a goal.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Avatar**: The player represents an avatar that can interact with walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers.\n   - **Objects**: The level features immovable sprites (walls, goal), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers).\n   - The game employs various interactions (e.g., boxes can shield the avatar from lasers, boulders can harm the avatar).\n\n2. **Movement and Physics**:\n   - The avatar can step back when colliding with walls or certain hazards.\n   - The use of boxes as shields and to bounce off walls adds a layer of strategy to navigation.\n\n3. **Combat and Hazards**:\n   - Lasers kill the avatar if they make contact, whether frontal or from another angle.\n   - The presence of holes introduces potential death traps for the avatar.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the **goal** sprite, which gives a score change of 5.\n- Collectively avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders while successfully traversing through the level without losing all lives.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal, which reduces the number of goal sprites to zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (essentially when the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigating Obstacles**: \n   - Use walls to bounce off the avatar strategically and move around without allowing boulders or lasers to damage you.\n   - Utilize boxes to shield from laser attacks, effectively placing them to create a safe path.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - Be mindful of the interactions with boulders. If they transform into the movable sprite \"boulderm\", this mechanic can be advantageous or detrimental depending on their positioning.\n   - Carefully choose when and where to move, especially avoiding boulders when the avatar is nearby.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Position the avatar away from lasers, especially in their path of motion.\n   - Plan movements to offset potential collisions with holes that could lead to immediate loss.\n\n4. **Goal-Oriented Moves**:\n   - Assess the layout for the quickest path to the goal while avoiding risks. Movement should be directed by potential interactions and the current state of hazards present.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - The game may require some trials to understand how different interactions affect the level dynamics. Learning from each attempt will present more successful pathways to the goal.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the mechanics effectively, players will enhance their chances of reaching the ultimate goal while avoiding hazards throughout the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

This position is immediately adjacent to several walls and a hole, all of which limit movement.\n\n### Surrounding Objects:\n- **Walls (represented by '*')**: Surrounding the avatar is a solid wall structure, leaving very little room for movement.\n- **Holes (represented by '%')**: To the immediate right and below the avatar, there are holes that pose a danger if the avatar steps into them.\n- **Boulders (represented by '@')**: There are several boulders located around the area, but these are either too far away or not accessible due to walls.\n- **Goal (represented by '$')**: The nearest goal is positioned further into the layout, but the immediate path towards it is blocked by walls and holes.\n\n### Available Actions:\nThe avatar\u2019s immediate options for interaction are significantly limited. Since most adjacent spaces are either walls or hazards, interaction options are minimal. The primary goal is to navigate towards the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Nearest Item Analysis:\n- The nearest items to the avatar are:\n  - **Walls**: Immoveable, providing no interaction.\n  - **Holes**: Represent danger.\n  - **Boulders and Boxes**: None are approachable due to positioning.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate to the goal while avoiding pitfalls and hazards. Given the current state, moving directly into the next hole is not advisable.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the constraints and the danger posed by holes, the avatar should first assess the possibility of retreating to safer areas while planning a more strategic route towards the goal in future moves. It could also be beneficial to try and find paths leading around larger obstacles further down the layout.\n\nAs the avatar is blocked and cannot move left, right, up, or down without entering a hazard, the best approach is to consider a turn away from danger. \n\n```**reassess your position and plan a route to avoid the immediate dangers of holes; backtrack if necessary to find a safer maneuver.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."

The main concern is to avoid stepping into a hole.\n\n#### Nearest Item Analysis:\n- The nearest interactable objects surrounding the avatar are:\n  - **Walls**: These are barriers with no potential for interaction.\n  - **Holes**: These present a significant risk and must be avoided at all costs.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal remains to reach the goal sprite ('g'), but with the current positioning, immediate movement toward it is blocked or leads to hazards.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince moving to either right or down would immediately lead the avatar to a hole, the avatar must first ensure it remains safe. Given that the positions immediately adjacent to the avatar are either walls or hazard holes, the strategy must involve planning safe, strategic movement.\n\n#### Best Course of Action:\nGiven the constraints of the current position, the best immediate action is to stay put to avoid falling into a hole. The next step would be to look for a future opportunity to maneuver around walls and toward the goal.\n\n```**stay put to avoid danger and plan the next move carefully to navigate around the walls toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This position is surrounded by walls on all sides, with a hole directly below at (2, 1).\n\n### Surrounding Objects:\n- **Walls (represented as 'b')**: These surround the avatar on three sides (left, above, right).\n- **Hole (represented as '%')**: Located directly below the avatar (2, 1), this is a lethal hazard.\n- **Boulders (represented as '@') and Boxes (represented as '#')**: These are not immediately accessible from the avatar's current position as they are located further in the layout.\n\n### Available Actions:\nFrom the current position (1, 1):\n- **Up (0, 1)**: Blocked by a wall.\n- **Left (1, 0)**: Blocked by a wall.\n- **Right (1, 2)**: Blocked by a wall.\n- **Down (2, 1)**: Leads to a hole, causing instant loss.\n\n#### Nearest Item Analysis:\nThe surrounding environment consists solely of walls and a hole. There are no interactable items (like boxes or boulders) that are accessible to the avatar at this time. The only movement left for the avatar is towards the hole, which would result in immediate defeat.\n\n### Objective:\nThe ultimate objective remains to navigate toward the goal (represented as '$') while avoiding hazards and pitfalls. However, at the avatar\u2019s current coordinates, movement options are completely limited by the surrounding walls and the hole below.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven that there are no safe movement options available, the best course of action for the avatar is to:\n\n1. **Remain Stationary**: The avatar should remain in its current position to avoid falling into the hole, which would lead to an immediate loss.\n2. **Evaluate Future Options**: As the game state currently doesn't allow any meaningful movement, the avatar must anticipate future opportunities to move toward the goal once a safe angle becomes available.\n\nIn this scenario, since the character cannot proceed forward in any direction without risking defeat, the most prudent action involves waiting for a chance to create new paths or opportunities in subsequent turns.\n\n```**stay put to avoid falling into the hole; wait for a change in state that may allow movement toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

If they transform into the movable sprite \"boulderm\", this mechanic can be advantageous or detrimental depending on their positioning.\n   - Carefully choose when and where to move, especially avoiding boulders when the avatar is nearby.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Position the avatar away from lasers, especially in their path of motion.\n   - Plan movements to offset potential collisions with holes that could lead to immediate loss.\n\n4. **Goal-Oriented Moves**:\n   - Assess the layout for the quickest path to the goal while avoiding risks.

Therefore, there are no potential actions available for the avatar in the current state.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal is still to navigate toward the goal sprite (represented as '$'), which lies further down in the layout. However, reaching the goal is currently impossible due to the immediate hazards and walls surrounding the avatar.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\nGiven the current predicament, the best course of action for the avatar is:\n\n1. **Stay Still**: The avatar cannot move to any other space without either running into walls or falling into a hole. Remaining stationary is the only option to avoid immediate danger.\n2. **Wait for Opportunities**: The current state is unfavorable for movement or interaction with any objects. The avatar should wait for a possible change in conditions that might open up new paths in subsequent turns.\n\nAs there are no available movements without risking a loss, the avatar\u2019s strategy is to remain in its current location.\n\n```**stay put to avoid falling into the hole; remain alert for future opportunities to navigate toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

If they transform into the movable sprite \"boulderm\", this mechanic can be advantageous or detrimental depending on their positioning.\n   - Carefully choose when and where to move, especially avoiding boulders when the avatar is nearby.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Position the avatar away from lasers, especially in their path of motion.\n   - Plan movements to offset potential collisions with holes that could lead to immediate loss.\n\n4. **Goal-Oriented Moves**:\n   - Assess the layout for the quickest path to the goal while avoiding risks. Movement should be directed by potential interactions and the current state of hazards present.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - The game may require some trials to understand how different interactions affect the level dynamics. Learning from each attempt will present more successful pathways to the goal.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the mechanics effectively, players will enhance their chances of reaching the ultimate goal while avoiding hazards throughout the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you .

These walls restrict movement entirely in those directions.\n- **Hole (represented by '0')**: Located directly below the avatar at (2, 1). Moving down into this hole results in an immediate loss.\n- **Boulders (represented as '@')** and **Boxes (represented as '#')**: Present in the layout but positioned too far from the avatar to interact with.\n\n### Available Actions:\nFrom the avatar's position:\n- **Up (0, 1)**: Blocked by a wall.\n- **Left (1, 0)**: Blocked by a wall.\n- **Right (1, 2)**: Blocked by a wall.\n- **Down (2, 1)**: Leads to a hole, which would cause the avatar to lose.\n\n### Nearest Item Analysis:\nThe area directly surrounding the avatar consists only of walls and a hole. There are no interactable items (boxes, boulders) currently available nearby.\n\n### Objective:\nThe ultimate goal is to reach the sprite representing the goal (denoted as '$'), but all possible routes at the moment are blocked by walls or dangerous holes.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the trapped situation of the avatar, the strategy must be simple:\n1. **Stay Still**: The only reasonable action for the avatar is to remain where it is, since any attempt to move results in hitting a wall or falling into a hole.\n2. **Wait for Changes**: Since the avatar cannot currently move, it needs to be patient and wait for the game to provide a new opportunity for action.\n\nSince the avatar\u2019s current position does not allow for any movement without resulting in loss, holding position is essential.\n\n```**stay put to avoid falling into the hole; wait for any changes in the game state that could provide a path forward.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

It combines elements of spatial reasoning, interaction between various types of objects, and movement mechanics typical of platformers. The avatar navigates a level filled with obstacles and hazards while aiming to reach a goal.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Avatar**: The player represents an avatar that can interact with walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers.\n   - **Objects**: The level features immovable sprites (walls, goal), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers).\n   - The game employs various interactions (e.g., boxes can shield the avatar from lasers, boulders can harm the avatar).\n\n2. **Movement and Physics**:\n   - The avatar can step back when colliding with walls or certain hazards.\n   - The use of boxes as shields and to bounce off walls adds a layer of strategy to navigation.\n\n3. **Combat and Hazards**:\n   - Lasers kill the avatar if they make contact, whether frontal or from another angle.\n   - The presence of holes introduces potential death traps for the avatar.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the **goal** sprite, which gives a score change of 5.\n- Collectively avoiding hazards like lasers and boulders while successfully traversing through the level without losing all lives.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal, which reduces the number of goal sprites to zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (essentially when the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigating Obstacles**: \n   - Use walls to bounce off the avatar strategically and move around without allowing boulders or lasers to damage you.\n   - Utilize boxes to shield from laser attacks, effectively placing them to create a safe path.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - Be mindful of the interactions with boulders. If they transform into the movable sprite \"boulderm\", this mechanic can be advantageous or detrimental depending on their positioning.\n   - Carefully choose when and where to move, especially avoiding boulders when the avatar is nearby.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Position the avatar away from lasers, especially in their path of motion.\n   - Plan movements to offset potential collisions with holes that could lead to immediate loss.\n\n4. **Goal-Oriented Moves**:\n   - Assess the layout for the quickest path to the goal while avoiding risks. Movement should be directed by potential interactions and the current state of hazards present.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - The game may require some trials to understand how different interactions affect the level dynamics. Learning from each attempt will present more successful pathways to the goal.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the mechanics effectively, players will enhance their chances of reaching the ultimate goal while avoiding hazards throughout the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him.
