Players navigate through levels while interacting with various objects to achieve specific objectives, often involving spatial awareness and problem-solving skills. \n\n#### Mechanics\nThe mechanics of the game can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Sprites:** The game environment contains immovable objects (walls, ground, hole, goal) and movable/passive objects (boxes, boulders). The avatar (player character) interacts with these objects in various ways.\n  \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers, which can either hinder progress or assist in clearing paths.\n  - Certain interactions cause transformations; for instance, the avatar can be transformed into a \"boulderm\" sprite if hit by a boulder.\n  - Players can use boxes to shield themselves from lasers or bounce forward.\n  - Entering the goal changes the game state, indicating successful completion of the level.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite, represented as 'goal avatar', while avoiding hazards (lasers) and managing obstacles (like boulders and walls). Successfully reaching the goal provides a score change (scoreChange=5).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal (sprite 'goal') within the level, which also impacts the score.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite's counter reaches 0, indicating the avatar has been eliminated, or possible game-over scenarios from hazards (e.g., entering a hole or hitting a laser).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Awareness of Hazards:** Players should always be cognizant of the positioning of lasers and avoid entering their line of fire. Utilize boxes and walls effectively to shield oneself.\n\n2. **Manipulation of Objects:** Box and boulder interactions form a critical element of strategy. Use boxes to bounce away from walls or redirect movement towards the goal while preventing boulders from hitting the avatar directly.\n\n3. **Efficient Pathfinding:** Analyze the layout and identify the least hazardous route. This might involve moving around walls to corner areas where the goal is accessible with minimal risk.\n\n4. **Score Management:** Since reaching the goal increases the score, players should prioritize finding paths that minimize risk while maximizing efficiency and speed towards the goal.\n\n5. **Experiment and Adapt:** Given the variety of interactions between sprites, experimenting with different approaches\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

Players navigate through levels while interacting with various objects to achieve specific objectives, often involving spatial awareness and problem-solving skills. \n\n#### Mechanics\nThe mechanics of the game can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Sprites:** The game environment contains immovable objects (walls, ground, hole, goal) and movable/passive objects (boxes, boulders). The avatar (player character) interacts with these objects in various ways.\n  \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers, which can either hinder progress or assist in clearing paths.\n  - Certain interactions cause transformations; for instance, the avatar can be transformed into a \"boulderm\" sprite if hit by a boulder.\n  - Players can use boxes to shield themselves from lasers or bounce forward.\n  - Entering the goal changes the game state, indicating successful completion of the level.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite, represented as 'goal avatar', while avoiding hazards (lasers) and managing obstacles (like boulders and walls). Successfully reaching the goal provides a score change (scoreChange=5).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal (sprite 'goal') within the level, which also impacts the score.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite's counter reaches 0, indicating the avatar has been eliminated, or possible game-over scenarios from hazards (e.g., entering a hole or hitting a laser).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Awareness of Hazards:** Players should always be cognizant of the positioning of lasers and avoid entering their line of fire. Utilize boxes and walls effectively to shield oneself.\n\n2. **Manipulation of Objects:** Box and boulder interactions form a critical element of strategy. Use boxes to bounce away from walls or redirect movement towards the goal while preventing boulders from hitting the avatar directly.\n\n3. **Efficient Pathfinding:** Analyze the layout and identify the least hazardous route. This might involve moving around walls to corner areas where the goal is accessible with minimal risk.\n\n4. **Score Management:** Since reaching the goal increases the score, players should prioritize finding paths that minimize risk while maximizing efficiency and speed towards the goal.\n\n5. **Experiment and Adapt:** Given the variety of interactions between sprites, experimenting with different approaches\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The avatar (player character) interacts with these objects in various ways.\n  \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers, which can either hinder progress or assist in clearing paths.\n  - Certain interactions cause transformations; for instance, the avatar can be transformed into a \"boulderm\" sprite if hit by a boulder.\n  - Players can use boxes to shield themselves from lasers or bounce forward.\n  - Entering the goal changes the game state, indicating successful completion of the level.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite, represented as 'goal avatar', while avoiding hazards (lasers) and managing obstacles (like boulders and walls). Successfully reaching the goal provides a score change (scoreChange=5).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal (sprite 'goal') within the level, which also impacts the score.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite's counter reaches 0, indicating the avatar has been eliminated, or possible game-over scenarios from hazards (e.g., entering a hole or hitting a laser).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Awareness of Hazards:** Players should always be cognizant of the positioning of lasers and avoid entering their line of fire. Utilize boxes and walls effectively to shield oneself.\n\n2. **Manipulation of Objects:** Box and boulder interactions form a critical element of strategy. Use boxes to bounce away from walls or redirect movement towards the goal while preventing boulders from hitting the avatar directly.\n\n3. **Efficient Pathfinding:** Analyze the layout and identify the least hazardous route. This might involve moving around walls to corner areas where the goal is accessible with minimal risk.\n\n4. **Score Management:** Since reaching the goal increases the score, players should prioritize finding paths that minimize risk while maximizing efficiency and speed towards the goal.\n\n5. **Experiment and Adapt:** Given the variety of interactions between sprites, experimenting with different approaches\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.
