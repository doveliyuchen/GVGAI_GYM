    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the game's rules, sprites, interactions, and layout, the analysis is as follows:\n\n### Genre\nThe game appears to fall under the puzzle-platformer genre. Players control an avatar navigating through a level, solving puzzles and avoiding hazards to reach a specific goal.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are various sprites including walls, holes, a goal, an avatar, movable boxes, boulders, and laser cannons, each with specific functions and interactions.\n2. **Movement**: The avatar can move around the level, interact with objects (like boxes and boulders), and must avoid hazards (like lasers and holes).\n3. **Interactions**: The game has a complex set of interactions that define how sprites affect each other. For instance:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes and shields from frontal lasers.\n   - Boulders can kill the avatar if they collide, and certain types can transform based on interactions.\n   - Laser cannons fire lasers that can kill the avatar based on its orientation.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding hazards. Success is measured by reaching the goal, which also grants the player points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`) without dying.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The avatar can lose if it either:\n  - Collides with a laser in a way that is not frontal, resulting in a death (`killIfNotFrontal`).\n  - Falls into a hole (`avatar hole > stepBack`), which seems to indicate a failure as no score is mentioned here.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Carefully navigate the level, ensuring to avoid walls, lasers, and holes to maintain health. Start by mapping out the safe routes.\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use boxes tactically:\n   - Use them as shields against lasers.\n   - Bounce off them to gain better positioning.\n3. **Manage Hazards**:\n   - Monitor the placement and firing directions of laser cannons, and try to use the environment to block shots as needed.\n   - Use the boulders strategically to either clear paths to the goal or protect the avatar.\n4. **Timing**: Timing your movements will be crucial, especially in relation to the movement of lasers and other dynamic obstacles.\n5. **Objective Prioritization**: Focus on reaching the goal while managing interactions with other sprites for score maximization.\n6. **Experimentation**: Since there are many interactions available, you may need to experiment with different sequences to find optimal paths or combinations of actions.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, this game challenges players to think strategically about how to maneuver through a hazardous environment while managing resources and timing movements. The interactions create a layered complexity, making thoughtful planning and execution key to completing levels successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n@\nc\n#\nd\n$\ne\nb\n*\nf\n%\n&\ng\n@\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nTo navigate through the current level effectively and reach the goal while avoiding hazards, I'll present a high-level strategy for the next steps you can take based on the game's mechanics, current state, and interactions.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n1. **Assess the Current Layout**:\n   - Identify the key sprites around the avatar, such as walls, obstacles (like the `*` and `#`), goal (`$`), and hazards (%).\n   - Note the positions of the `@`, which seem to allow for interaction, and analyze how they can be utilized to progress toward the goal.\n\n2. **Prioritize Safe Movements**:\n   - Move carefully, ensuring that any step taken does not lead into hazards or walls.\n   - Given that your environment has `*` (which could represent solid surfaces), prioritize movements that keep the avatar on these surfaces while navigating to the `goal`.\n\n3. **Use Interactions to Your Advantage**:\n   - Look for opportunities to use the `&` sprites (which might represent movable objects) to block incoming hazards (the `%` hazards) or to create pathways to the `goal`.\n   - If you can move a box or object nearby, consider doing so to create a new path or shield the avatar from hazards.\n\n4. **Strategically Plan the Path**:\n   - Avoid direct paths that could lead to hazardous `%` spaces. Instead, identify detours around these threats.\n   - Utilize the `@` sprites for possible jumping or bouncing if they present as interactable zones leading to a safer pathway.\n\n5. **Time Your Movements**:\n   - Observe any movement patterns of dynamic hazards and time movements to avoid getting caught by inequalities in hazard patterns.\n   - If you anticipate a hazard\u2019s route, use intervals to move when safe and minimize exposure time.\n\n6. **Employ a Two-Step Approach**: \n   - First, approach any movable sprite, check its surrounding status, and consider its role (block, bounce, or create a new path).\n   - Next, adjust its position to exploit its properties while moving closer towards the goal ($).\n\n7. **Plan for Possible Setbacks**:\n   - If the pathway to the goal becomes obstructed or if you face a setback due to hazards, have a secondary pathway planned.\n   - Continually assess for ways to return to interaction zones (the `@` sprites) and avoid falling into reoccurring pitfalls like `%` spaces.\n\n### Example Next Moves\n1. **Move Right to `@`**: This can allow you to assess and potentially trigger interactions, checking for further safe locations.\n2. **Evaluate Object Movements**: From `@`, assess if any surrounding boxes (`*`) can be moved into the path of the `%` hazards to provide a cover or alternate route.\n3. **Continue From a Safe Surface**: After navigating through `@` and `*`, analyze the pathway leading towards goal `$` and eliminate as many hazards along the way.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy methodically assessing the interactions and movements within the game, you can devise an effective strategy to reach the goal while managing hazards and leveraging sprites to your advantage. Focus on tactical navigation, use resources wisely, and be prepared to adapt your strategy as the situation evolves.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"
