    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules and level layout, this game appears to be a puzzle-platformer combined with elements of strategy. The use of immovable sprites, interaction mechanics, and the objective of navigating through obstacles to reach a goal suggests a blend of platforming, puzzle-solving, and possibly timed challenges.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites are defined, including immovable walls and goals, as well as projectiles like lasers. The player controls an avatar that interacts with different objects in the environment.\n- **Interactions**: The game features complex interactions among objects, particularly with regard to blocking paths (walls), avoiding hazard projectiles (lasers), and manipulating boxes and boulders to solve puzzles. \n  - The interaction mechanics include various outcomes: killing sprites, attracting gaze, stepping back, bouncing forward, and others, indicating the need for strategic movement and positioning.\n  \n- **Movement and Orientation**: The avatar moves in relation to the surrounding environment, stepping back from walls, and being wary of interactions with lethal objects like lasers.\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while navigating around obstacles and avoiding hazards. Reaching the goal results in a score increase (+5 points).\n  \n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite (score increases, and sprite counter for goal reaches zero).\n- **Losing Condition**: The player loses if there are no avatars left (SpriteCounter for avatar limit reaches zero).\n\n#### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Safety First**: Always assess potential hazards like lasers and boulders before moving. Remember that collisions with lasers result in immediate loss of the avatar.\n  \n2. **Use the Environment**: Make effective use of boxes and boulders to block lasers and other hazards. This can involve pushing boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks or positioning boulders to redirect laser paths.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Since movement can lead to stepping back or being pushed around by obstacles, a carefully thought-out path can help navigate closer to the goal without losing performance.\n\n4. **Maximize Score**: Whenever possible, try to interact with game elements that can increase your score (e.g., killing boulders or others with lasers or engaging with avatars effectively). Each interaction can have significant outcomes that affect score and survival.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**: Given the complexity of interactions, being prepared for trial and error is essential. If a move leads to an undesirable outcome, take note to adjust strategies.\n\n6. **Timing**: Consider the timing of movements, especially when lasers are involved. Moving in sync with laser activations may allow for safe navigation toward the goal.\n\nUsing these strategies, players can effectively manage their avatar's interactions, navigate obstacles, and ultimately reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.
