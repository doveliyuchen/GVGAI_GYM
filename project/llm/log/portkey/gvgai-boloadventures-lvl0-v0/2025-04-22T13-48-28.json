The player can also earn points by destroying holes with boulders which yields 1 point for both sprites involved.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The objective is to reach the 'goal' while managing interactions with other objects and avoiding death through various hazards (falling into holes, getting hit by lasers, or being crushed by boulders).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Achieving the objective of moving the avatar to the 'goal' sprite changes the game state to win.\n- **Loss Condition:** If the avatar sprite is eliminated or reduced to zero remaining sprites, the game concludes with a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout and recognize patterns or traps that might exist between hazards (lasers, boulders, and walls).\n\n2. **Object Utilization:** \n   - Use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks and to push other objects when necessary.\n   - Manage the placement of boulders and boxes to control movement in the level.

Players must navigate through a grid-like layout using objects, avoiding threats, and interacting with various elements to solve puzzles and achieve goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game uses distinct sprites for different elements, including ground, walls, holes, goals, the avatar (the player's character), boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Interactions:** Various interactions dictate how the avatar and objects behave when they come into contact:\n  - The avatar can bounce off walls, push boxes, and interact with lasers in a way that is fatal if not careful.\n  - Boulders can transform into moving versions (boulderm) and can kill the avatar when they interact, suggesting that they are dangerous.\n  - The player can use boxes as shields against frontal laser attacks.\n- **Goal and Scoring:** The primary goal is to move the avatar to the 'goal' sprite to score points (5 points) and lead to victory. The player can also earn points by destroying holes with boulders which yields 1 point for both sprites involved.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The objective is to reach the 'goal' while managing interactions with other objects and avoiding death through various hazards (falling into holes, getting hit by lasers, or being crushed by boulders).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Achieving the objective of moving the avatar to the 'goal' sprite changes the game state to win.\n- **Loss Condition:** If the avatar sprite is eliminated or reduced to zero remaining sprites, the game concludes with a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout and recognize patterns or traps that might exist between hazards (lasers, boulders, and walls).\n\n2. **Object Utilization:** \n   - Use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks and to push other objects when necessary.\n   - Manage the placement of boulders and boxes to control movement in the level.

The player can also earn points by destroying holes with boulders which yields 1 point for both sprites involved.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The objective is to reach the 'goal' while managing interactions with other objects and avoiding death through various hazards (falling into holes, getting hit by lasers, or being crushed by boulders).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Achieving the objective of moving the avatar to the 'goal' sprite changes the game state to win.\n- **Loss Condition:** If the avatar sprite is eliminated or reduced to zero remaining sprites, the game concludes with a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout and recognize patterns or traps that might exist between hazards (lasers, boulders, and walls).\n\n2. **Object Utilization:** \n   - Use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks and to push other objects when necessary.\n   - Manage the placement of boulders and boxes to control movement in the level.

Players must navigate through a grid-like layout using objects, avoiding threats, and interacting with various elements to solve puzzles and achieve goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game uses distinct sprites for different elements, including ground, walls, holes, goals, the avatar (the player's character), boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Interactions:** Various interactions dictate how the avatar and objects behave when they come into contact:\n  - The avatar can bounce off walls, push boxes, and interact with lasers in a way that is fatal if not careful.\n  - Boulders can transform into moving versions (boulderm) and can kill the avatar when they interact, suggesting that they are dangerous.\n  - The player can use boxes as shields against frontal laser attacks.\n- **Goal and Scoring:** The primary goal is to move the avatar to the 'goal' sprite to score points (5 points) and lead to victory. The player can also earn points by destroying holes with boulders which yields 1 point for both sprites involved.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The objective is to reach the 'goal' while managing interactions with other objects and avoiding death through various hazards (falling into holes, getting hit by lasers, or being crushed by boulders).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Achieving the objective of moving the avatar to the 'goal' sprite changes the game state to win.\n- **Loss Condition:** If the avatar sprite is eliminated or reduced to zero remaining sprites, the game concludes with a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout and recognize patterns or traps that might exist between hazards (lasers, boulders, and walls).\n\n2. **Object Utilization:** \n   - Use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks and to push other objects when necessary.\n   - Manage the placement of boulders and boxes to control movement in the level.
