The incorporation of interaction between various sprites and the need for spatial reasoning suggests a game that requires players to solve puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n    - There are several passive objects (e.g., boulders, boxes) that can affect the player's movement or interactions.\n    - The player (avatar) can interact with walls, obstacles, and other sprites to achieve a specific outcome, such as being shielded, bouncing, or being killed.\n    - Lasers represent a deadly threat and can kill the avatar based on the orientation of the interaction.\n\n2. **Movement**:\n    - The avatar must navigate through the level, avoiding hazards and possibly solving puzzles involving the manipulation of boxes and boulders.\n    - Interaction with walls will cause the avatar to step back, indicating the presence of confined movement but with strategic positioning being key.\n\n3. **Objectives**:\n   - The primary objective is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding hazards (like lasers or falling into holes) and utilizing other objects to create pathways or clear obstacles.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins if they reach and interact with the goal sprite, which results in a score change of +5.\n- **Losing**: The player loses if there are no remaining avatars (SpriteCounter stype=avatar reaches limit 0).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Mapping the Level**:\n   - Start by scouting the entire level layout. Identify the locations of the walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and lasers.\n   - Pay attention to the placement of the goal and potential paths leading towards it.\n\n2. **Safe Navigation**:\n   - Always assess the movement before making any step. The avatar should avoid being killed by the lasers or falling into holes.\n   - Use blocks and other sprites as shields to help navigate through dangerous areas.\n\n3. **Manipulating Objects**:\n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal lasers. Move boulders carefully to create pathways away from immediate threats.\n   - Determine how to use the interactions with boulders and boxes to access the goal efficiently.\n\n4. **Planning Ahead**:\n   - Think a few moves ahead. Each step could impact the availability of other sprites (like boulders and boxes). \n   - Experiment with and understand interactions thoroughly. For example, pushing a boulder into the wall instead of on the path could save the avatar from immediate danger.\n\n5. **Scoring**:\n   - Aim to reach the goal while maximizing score. If there are opportunities to score additional points (e.g., interacting with certain sprites beneficially), factor those into the strategy as well.\n\nBy thinking critically about each move, avoiding hazards, and manipulating the environment strategically, players can work towards winning the game while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*.a*\n*%%..........*......*..*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*......&*.......@...*@@*\n*......&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=22)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=0, x=0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- The avatar 'a' is located at (y=12, x=1). \n- The goal '$' is located at (y=11, x=11), and there are several holes '%' nearby.\n- The immediate area around the avatar includes walls and boxes, making movement slightly restricted.\n- Notably, there are boulders '@' and holes '%', which the avatar must navigate carefully to avoid losing.\n\n**Strategic Steps:**\n\n1. **Evaluate Immediate Surroundings:**\n   - At (y=12, x=1), the avatar is adjacent to a wall to the left and right (walls prevent horizontal movement). There is a wall above and below as well.\n   - Directly to the right (x=2) and left (x=0) are also walls, leaving only downward and upward navigational options.\n\n2. **Identify Available Interactions:**\n   - Since movement is limited, the box '#' at (y=10, x=3) is a potential item to interact with. However, it is currently out of reach.\n   - The only options for now include moving vertically since all horizontal pathways are blocked by walls.\n\n3. **Next Move: \"Move Down\"**\n   - **Action:** Move downward to (y=13, x=1) \u2013 however, this space is empty and leads further down to only more holes.\n\n4. **Assessment After Move:**\n   - This action doesn\u2019t advance toward the goal and does not produce any new possible interactions.\n   - The avatar is now at (y=13, x=1) where there is no immediate progress toward the goal due to more holes below.\n\n5. **New Interaction Identification:**\n   - Since direct movement isn\u2019t yielding results, the next step should involve inspecting the nearby boxes.\n   - The nearest interactable item is the box '#' at (y=10, x=3), but given walls' constraints, it cannot be reached from the current position.\n\n### Updated Strategy Based on Observations:\n\n### Nearest Interactable Item Strategy: **\"Push the Box\"**\n- **Objective:** Attempting to push the box at (y=10, x=3) would be the next focus.\n- **Action Needed:** Navigate closer to this box, considering potential routes.\n\n**Logical Conclusion:**\n- Given wall constraints, the next potential optimal movement would involve finding pathways leading to interactive objects like the box while avoiding the holes.\n- Continuing move down is not optimal. Determine a way to shift the environment towards accessing the box strategically despite the wall barriers.\n\n### Final Action Proposal:\n1. **Try to Navigate Upwards or Right While Looking for New Paths to Box**\n2. **If Blocked, Re-evaluate Surroundings at (y=12, x=1) and Explore Possible Pathways**\n3. **The goal is to reach the box for the next move, which might lead to an eventual pathway toward the goal.**\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."

This box is important because:\n  - It can be used to create a pathway or shield against potential traps, leading towards the goal.\n  \n### Proposed Strategy:\n\n### \"Approach the Box\"\n1. **Action:** Move to (y=11, x=1) by going up from the current position. \n2. **Rationale:** This move directs the player closer to the box at (y=10, x=3). While the avatar is still not positioned directly at the box, it positions itself towards the goal.\n3. **State After Movement Check:** Ensure no immediate hazards or obstacles (like walls) block the path after moving.\n\n**Next Steps if Movement is Successful:**\n- If the avatar successfully moves to (y=11, x=1) and there are no additional hazards, the next action would be to push the box at (y=10, x=3) towards the goal path.\n\n### Potential Obstacles to Consider:\n- If moving up leads to unexpected consequences (e.g., a wall or obstruction blocking further moves), note:\n  - \"A wall is blocking upward movement; try moving towards the right (if not blocked).\"\n  - Identify alternative pathways should direct movement toward the nearest interactable item remain obstructed, eventually leading to the box.\n\n**Revised Action Proposal:** \n- **Objective:** Focus on creating an effective route toward the goal by collaborating actions between the avatar and the box.\n- If stuck, identify the second nearest interactable spry (potentially the other boulders).\n\n### Concluding Strategy:\nAfter the move to (y=11, x=1), assess if further manipulation with the box can lead to opportunities to clear a route towards the goal reliably and safely.

Accessing this box will allow for future manipulation to create a path toward reaching the goal.\n- There are holes '%' below (at y=11, x=0 and y=11, x=4) that need to be avoided when navigating.\n\n### Proposed Strategy: **\"Move Up\"**\n\n1. **Action:** Move up from **(y=12, x=1)** to **(y=11, x=1)**.\n2. **Rationale:** This upward movement is the only viable option, as it will position the avatar to potentially interact with the box on the next turn. It also helps avoid the holes directly below.\n3. **Goal:** The aim is to set up for interacting with the box during future moves, which is crucial for progressing toward the goal located further up in the level.\n\n### Consideration for Movement Outcomes:\n- **If Movement is Blocked:** \n  - If the avatar cannot move up due to unexpected blocking, reason: \"A wall is blocking your movement upward.\"\n  - The avatar could then reassess potential horizontal or downward movements, but in this situation, left and right are unavailable due to walls, leaving no other options.\n  \n### Final Summary:\n1. **Next Move:** Move Up to **(y=11, x=1)**.\n2. **Post-Move Objective:** Planning to assess interaction with the box at **(y=10, x=3)** next.\n3. **Adaptation:** Monitor the game state closely after each action, ensuring navigation toward the goal remains optimal while avoiding hazards such as holes.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The incorporation of interaction between various sprites and the need for spatial reasoning suggests a game that requires players to solve puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n    - There are several passive objects (e.g., boulders, boxes) that can affect the player's movement or interactions.\n    - The player (avatar) can interact with walls, obstacles, and other sprites to achieve a specific outcome, such as being shielded, bouncing, or being killed.\n    - Lasers represent a deadly threat and can kill the avatar based on the orientation of the interaction.\n\n2. **Movement**:\n    - The avatar must navigate through the level, avoiding hazards and possibly solving puzzles involving the manipulation of boxes and boulders.\n    - Interaction with walls will cause the avatar to step back, indicating the presence of confined movement but with strategic positioning being key.\n\n3. **Objectives**:\n   - The primary objective is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding hazards (like lasers or falling into holes) and utilizing other objects to create pathways or clear obstacles.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins if they reach and interact with the goal sprite, which results in a score change of +5.\n- **Losing**: The player loses if there are no remaining avatars (SpriteCounter stype=avatar reaches limit 0).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Mapping the Level**:\n   - Start by scouting the entire level layout. Identify the locations of the walls, holes, boulders, boxes, and lasers.\n   - Pay attention to the placement of the goal and potential paths leading towards it.\n\n2. **Safe Navigation**:\n   - Always assess the movement before making any step. The avatar should avoid being killed by the lasers or falling into holes.\n   - Use blocks and other sprites as shields to help navigate through dangerous areas.\n\n3. **Manipulating Objects**:\n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal lasers. Move boulders carefully to create pathways away from immediate threats.\n   - Determine how to use the interactions with boulders and boxes to access the goal efficiently.\n\n4. **Planning Ahead**:\n   - Think a few moves ahead. Each step could impact the availability of other sprites (like boulders and boxes). \n   - Experiment with and understand interactions thoroughly. For example, pushing a boulder into the wall instead of on the path could save the avatar from immediate danger.\n\n5. **Scoring**:\n   - Aim to reach the goal while maximizing score. If there are opportunities to score additional points (e.g., interacting with certain sprites beneficially), factor those into the strategy as well.\n\nBy thinking critically about each move, avoiding hazards, and manipulating the environment strategically, players can work towards winning the game while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.
