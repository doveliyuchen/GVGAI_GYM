The presence of an avatar that navigates through obstacles, utilizes various environmental elements such as walls and boxes, and faces dynamic challenges (e.g., lasers and boulders) is indicative of this genre.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites and Interactions:** The game features multiple sprites including immovable objects (walls, ground, holes, goals), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers). The avatar interacts with these elements using a series of defined interactions. \n- **Movement and Positioning:** The avatar must navigate the level by avoiding hazards, such as lasers and boulders, while utilizing boxes to shield against frontal attacks.\n- **Transformation:** Different interactions cause sprites to transform into new forms, allowing players to manipulate the environment and potentially create pathways or solve puzzles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary goal of the game is to reach the goal sprite (\u2018goal\u2019), which gains the player points (scoreChange=5). Players must navigate through the level while avoiding or manipulating hazards (boulders and lasers) and using boxes to shield themselves.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, as indicated by the score change.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if there are no avatar sprites remaining (SpriteCounter limit=0), which means the avatar has been killed by interactions (e.g. with lasers or through collisions with boulders).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Understanding:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Notice where obstacles (walls and boulders) are located and plan your path to the goal accordingly.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:** The boxes can provide a protective barrier against lasers. When moving past areas with active lasers, position boxes between yourself and the lasers to shield from damage.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards:** Be cautious when moving near holes or lasers. Moving directly into a laser will result in death. Always check your positioning relative to potential dangers.\n\n4. **Timing and Precision:** Move carefully, especially in areas with both boulders and lasers. Timing your moves can be crucial\u2014wait for the laser to be in a safe state before proceeding.\n\n5. **Use Bounce and Transform Dynamics**: Interacting with boxes and boulders strategically can allow you to create pathways or maneuver around obstacles. For example, bouncing off a box can help change your position effectively without facing direct danger.\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions:** Since the game relies heavily on interactions between different objects, experiment with how various elements respond to one another. Understanding these mechanics can open up new strategies for traversal and avoidance.\n\n7. **Resource Management:** Be mindful of the limited number of avatar sprites. Each time you are killed, it reduces your chances of successfully navigating the level.\n\nBy employing these strategies while focusing on avoiding hazards and solving environmental puzzles, players can increase their chances of successfully reaching the goal and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n@\nc\n#\nd\n$\ne\nb\n*\nf\n%\n&\ng\n@\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n## High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n### Current Observations\nGiven the current state, the layout can be understood as follows:\n- The player\u2019s avatar is near the central area filled with various blocks, missiles, and potential hazards (represented by various special characters).\n- The goal is to reach the endpoint marked by \"$,\" while navigating through obstacles and avoiding hazards (noted as \"*\", \"@\", \"%\", and \"#\").\n- The position of the boxes (**c**) and environmental interactions will play a crucial role in strategy formulation.\n\n### Strategic Steps\n\n1. **Assessment of the Current Surroundings**:\n   - Determine the immediate hazards near the avatar (e.g., **\"@\"** indicates potential threats).\n   - Identify available boxes (**c**) for manipulation or shielding against missiles.\n\n2. **Creating Safe Pathways**:\n   - Look for opportunities to use boxes to block lasers or other moving threats. Move the boxes towards the laser lines before progressing towards the goal.\n   - Assess whether the boulders (**b**) can be used to create additional pathways or shield the avatar from imminent danger.\n\n3. **Optimal Movement**:\n   - **Prioritize Safety**: Before moving, ensure there is no immediate danger from obstacles such as \"**@**\" or \"**#**\".\n   - Move cautiously: Calculate the timing of any hazards, such as lasers, to avoid being hit. Wait for safe intervals before proceeding.\n\n4. **Utilization of Transformations**:\n   - If interactions allow transformation of objects, determine which object can best aid in creating a pathway or an escape from danger.\n   - For instance, check if bouncing off boxes (**c**) or interacting with blocks can provide a dynamic movement option to evade hazards effectively.\n\n5. **Incremental Progression**:\n   - Make advancements step-by-step, reassessing the situation with every move.\n   - After each action, take note of the new arrangements of obstacles and any threats.\n\n6. **Resource Management**:\n   - Keep track of the number of remaining avatar sprites. Prioritize survival over aggressive moves.\n   - If needed, temporarily retreat to safe zones to reassess the strategy if multiple hazards are present.\n\n7. **End Goal Focus**:\n   - Keep a clear path towards reaching the goal marker (\"$\"). Plan your route in a way that allows for minimal interaction with hazards.\n   - Visualize multiple iterations of moves ahead and assess which path leads to achieving the goal.\n\n8. **Adaptability**:\n   - Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on unexpected movements from hazards\u2014rapid decision-making will be crucial.\n   - If a pathway seems blocked or too dangerous, identify alternative routes through exploration or manipulation of the blocks.\n\n### Example Next Move\n1. Identify a safe box (**c**) to the left or right of the avatar's position.\n2. Move the box to create a barrier against the laser threat.\n3. Once shields are in place, move towards the closest opening without any visible hazards, ensuring the avatar's continued safety.\n\nBy implementing these strategies carefully and maintaining a cautious but strategic approach, players will maximize their chances of successfully navigating through towards the goal and winning the game.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"
