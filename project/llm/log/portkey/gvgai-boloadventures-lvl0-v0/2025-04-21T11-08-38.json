Given its mechanics, the game likely combines problem-solving through navigating environmental challenges and obstacles, as well as interacting with various sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as 'avatar', 'goal', 'boulders', 'lasers', 'holes', and 'walls'. Each has distinctive properties and interactions.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around and interact with these sprites. It can \"step back\" when colliding with walls and other sprites.\n- **Interactions**: Different sprites have unique interactions with the avatar, such as killing or bouncing back. The interactions are context-dependent, indicating a layered gameplay where strategic positioning matters.\n- **Missiles**: Lasers act as missiles that can harm the avatar based on its frontal position. This mechanic adds an element of danger and requires careful navigation.\n- **Transformations and Effects**: The presence of sprites like 'boulderm' suggests that the game might involve transformations or upgrades that influence gameplay.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objectives appear to be:\n1. Navigate from the avatar's starting position to the 'goal' while avoiding hazards such as walls and lasers.\n2. Score points by successfully interacting with certain sprites (like killing or avoiding them) and by reaching the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins if the 'goal' sprite is reached while the score reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 5 points).\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is killed or if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Positioning**: Carefully navigate around walls and lasers. It is important to always be aware of the laser direction to avoid being killed.\n2. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks, creating a strategy where you determine how to maneuver shields while attacking or avoiding hazards.\n3. **Movement**: Given the \"step back\" mechanic upon collision with walls and lasers, players should plan moves in a way that avoids getting stuck or pushed back unnecessarily.\n4. **Point Management**: Engage with the environment strategically; the player should aim to maximize their score by contriving kills using environmental hazards while being mindful of their own safety.\n5. **Exploration**: Explore different paths through the level while observing how different sprites interact. This knowledge will aid in clearing levels more efficiently.\n6. **Use of Boulders**: Boulders can both harm and help the avatar in certain situations (e.g., killing other sprites). Players should leverage this for advantageous interactions.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can enhance their performance within the game and achieve the overall objective of reaching the goal with the required scoring parameters.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Given its mechanics, the game likely combines problem-solving through navigating environmental challenges and obstacles, as well as interacting with various sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as 'avatar', 'goal', 'boulders', 'lasers', 'holes', and 'walls'. Each has distinctive properties and interactions.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around and interact with these sprites. It can \"step back\" when colliding with walls and other sprites.\n- **Interactions**: Different sprites have unique interactions with the avatar, such as killing or bouncing back. The interactions are context-dependent, indicating a layered gameplay where strategic positioning matters.\n- **Missiles**: Lasers act as missiles that can harm the avatar based on its frontal position. This mechanic adds an element of danger and requires careful navigation.\n- **Transformations and Effects**: The presence of sprites like 'boulderm' suggests that the game might involve transformations or upgrades that influence gameplay.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objectives appear to be:\n1. Navigate from the avatar's starting position to the 'goal' while avoiding hazards such as walls and lasers.\n2. Score points by successfully interacting with certain sprites (like killing or avoiding them) and by reaching the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins if the 'goal' sprite is reached while the score reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 5 points).\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is killed or if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Positioning**: Carefully navigate around walls and lasers. It is important to always be aware of the laser direction to avoid being killed.\n2. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks, creating a strategy where you determine how to maneuver shields while attacking or avoiding hazards.\n3. **Movement**: Given the \"step back\" mechanic upon collision with walls and lasers, players should plan moves in a way that avoids getting stuck or pushed back unnecessarily.\n4. **Point Management**: Engage with the environment strategically; the player should aim to maximize their score by contriving kills using environmental hazards while being mindful of their own safety.\n5. **Exploration**: Explore different paths through the level while observing how different sprites interact. This knowledge will aid in clearing levels more efficiently.\n6. **Use of Boulders**: Boulders can both harm and help the avatar in certain situations (e.g., killing other sprites). Players should leverage this for advantageous interactions.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can enhance their performance within the game and achieve the overall objective of reaching the goal with the required scoring parameters.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

It is important to always be aware of the laser direction to avoid being killed.\n2. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks, creating a strategy where you determine how to maneuver shields while attacking or avoiding hazards.\n3. **Movement**: Given the \"step back\" mechanic upon collision with walls and lasers, players should plan moves in a way that avoids getting stuck or pushed back unnecessarily.\n4. **Point Management**: Engage with the environment strategically; the player should aim to maximize their score by contriving kills using environmental hazards while being mindful of their own safety.\n5. **Exploration**: Explore different paths through the level while observing how different sprites interact. This knowledge will aid in clearing levels more efficiently.\n6. **Use of Boulders**: Boulders can both harm and help the avatar in certain situations (e.g., killing other sprites). Players should leverage this for advantageous interactions.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can enhance their performance within the game and achieve the overall objective of reaching the goal with the required scoring parameters.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

This mechanic adds an element of danger and requires careful navigation.\n- **Transformations and Effects**: The presence of sprites like 'boulderm' suggests that the game might involve transformations or upgrades that influence gameplay.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objectives appear to be:\n1. Navigate from the avatar's starting position to the 'goal' while avoiding hazards such as walls and lasers.\n2. Score points by successfully interacting with certain sprites (like killing or avoiding them) and by reaching the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins if the 'goal' sprite is reached while the score reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 5 points).\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is killed or if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Positioning**: Carefully navigate around walls and lasers. It is important to always be aware of the laser direction to avoid being killed.\n2. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks, creating a strategy where you determine how to maneuver shields while attacking or avoiding hazards.\n3. **Movement**: Given the \"step back\" mechanic upon collision with walls and lasers, players should plan moves in a way that avoids getting stuck or pushed back unnecessarily.\n4. **Point Management**: Engage with the environment strategically; the player should aim to maximize their score by contriving kills using environmental hazards while being mindful of their own safety.\n5. **Exploration**: Explore different paths through the level while observing how different sprites interact. This knowledge will aid in clearing levels more efficiently.\n6. **Use of Boulders**: Boulders can both harm and help the avatar in certain situations (e.g., killing other sprites). Players should leverage this for advantageous interactions.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can enhance their performance within the game and achieve the overall objective of reaching the goal with the required scoring parameters.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Given its mechanics, the game likely combines problem-solving through navigating environmental challenges and obstacles, as well as interacting with various sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as 'avatar', 'goal', 'boulders', 'lasers', 'holes', and 'walls'. Each has distinctive properties and interactions.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around and interact with these sprites. It can \"step back\" when colliding with walls and other sprites.\n- **Interactions**: Different sprites have unique interactions with the avatar, such as killing or bouncing back. The interactions are context-dependent, indicating a layered gameplay where strategic positioning matters.\n- **Missiles**: Lasers act as missiles that can harm the avatar based on its frontal position.
