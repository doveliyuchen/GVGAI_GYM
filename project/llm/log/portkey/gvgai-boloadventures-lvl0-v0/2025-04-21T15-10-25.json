It appears to combine platforming elements with strategic puzzle-solving mechanics, as players must navigate obstacles and interact with different elements within the environment to achieve objectives.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game contains various sprites, including the player (avatar), obstacles (walls, boulders), interactive objects (boxes), and hazards (lasers).\n   - There are immovable objects (walls, ground, goal) and passive objects that can interact with the player (boulders, boxes).\n   - Lasers are dynamically created from laser cannons and act as projectiles that can inflict damage.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The interactions between sprites form the core of gameplay. For example:\n     - Boulders can transform into a specific type when colliding with certain objects.\n     - The avatar interacts with objects to either shield itself or get knocked back.\n     - Laser interactions can cause the avatar to die if contacted directly.\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - The primary objective is to navigate the level and reach the goal (\u2018goal\u2019 sprite) represented by `0` on the map. Achieving this will score the player points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal with the avatar, which results in score changes positively (scoreChange=5).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is unable to continue (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0), meaning the avatar has either been defeated (collided with a laser) or no moves are possible.\n\n### Level Layout\n- The level consists of walls (denoted as `w`), open spaces (denoted by periods), the goal (`g`), the avatar (`A`), and laser cannons (`c`).\n- The layout is quite constraining, requiring strategic movement due to walls and various hazards.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify paths to the goal and avoid hazards.\n2. **Controlled Movement**: Focus on moving strategically rather than rushing. Observe laser patterns and determine safe moments to progress.\n3. **Use of Boxes**: Leverage boxes effectively; they can shield against frontal laser attacks and can be used to navigate around obstacles.\n4. **Object Interactions**: Experiment with object interactions. This includes using boulders to eliminate or avoid lasers and carefully managing your movement around passive obstacles that might block or obstruct paths.\n5. **Avoiding Hazards**: Plan routes that minimize contact with lasers. Since the avatar can be killed both frontally and non-frontally by lasers, ensure you are oriented away from them when passing by.\n6. **Goal-Oriented Play**: Your primary focus should always be towards reaching the goal. Evaluate the risk vs. reward of any action that could lead to being blocked or killed.\n\nBy following these strategic points, players should be able to navigate the challenges presented in the level effectively and reach the objective successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The player (avatar 'a') is located at (11, 1), surrounded by a combination of solid walls and potentially harmful elements. \n\n1. **Avatar's Location**: \n   - The avatar (represented by 'a') is not at the immediate vicinity of any walls but rather has a surrounding of open spaces and interactive objects (notably, items represented by symbols like '*').\n   - There are several nearby characters: '@' and '%', which might represent entities or hazards.\n\n2. **Surrounding Elements**:\n   - There are interactive items, including:\n     - `*` potentially representing blocks or destruction items.\n     - `&` may represent items that can be picked up or used (like tools).\n     - `%` possibly represents items relating to points or goals.\n   - Additionally, there are multiple avatars around, which indicates cooperative or competitive elements but might also present potential hazards.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\n\nConsidering the player's current state and objective to navigate successfully towards reaching the goal while avoiding hazards:\n\n1. **Interaction Priority**: \n   The focus should be on items that can be used to mitigate hazards or block pathways. The immediate target for interaction should be the item represented by `&`, as it might provide the player with a strategic advantage, such as enhancing capabilities or granting extra movements without interacting with negative obstacles.\n\n2. **Utilizing the Environment**: \n   The surrounding layout suggests possible routes and hazards. The strategy implies wisely using the items at hand (especially `&`), which could lead to further options for navigating towards the goal.\n\n3. **Threat Management**: \n   While interacting with the item, assess the position of adjacent sprites to ensure no immediate threats (like '@' or '%') place the avatar in a vulnerable position.\n\n4. **Objective Focus**: \n   Remain mindful of the ultimate aim to reach the goal, while leveraging any interaction with the `&` item to maneuver through the potential dangers present in the environment. \n\n```**Interact with the item represented by '&' to gain a possible advantage in navigating through the level and mitigating hazards, ensuring the safest path towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."

Now, a border of 'b's (likely representing walls) encloses the area, adding an extra layer of constraints while also presenting new options for strategy.\n\n1. **Avatar's Location**: \n   - The avatar is positioned next to a series of walls, indicated by 'b', and is directly adjacent to items marked with '&' and '*'. The items signify potential interactions that could advantage the avatar's journey toward the goal.\n\n2. **Surrounding Elements**:\n   - The item represented by '&' appears twice nearby, which could indicate it\u2019s a critical object for the next step. It likely provides an action that enhances movement or utility.\n   - The surrounding area is heavily enclosed by walls which could limit the avatar's movement if the interaction does not yield favorable results.\n\n3. **Threats**:\n   - There are also several obstacles, represented by '@' and '%', that the avatar must navigate around. Care must be taken to avoid engaging with these threats while interacting with items.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step should focus on interacting with the items at hand to advance toward the goal:\n\n1. **Item Interaction**: \n   The best course of action is to interact with one of the '&' items. This could potentially grant the avatar new abilities, items, or moves which can aid in bypassing hazards or walls.\n\n2. **Maximizing Benefits**: \n   Engaging with the '&' items may result in gaining a temporary advantage or unlocking further paths towards the goal, while minimizing interaction with threats posed by '@' and '%'.\n\n3. **Navigating Hazards**: \n   Carefully assess the movement routes after the interaction to ensure safe passage through the environment, making sure to position the avatar in a manner that avoids direct encounters with threats.\n\n4. **Objective Focus**: \n   Ultimately, the strategy should maintain focus on progressing toward the goal while utilizing any newfound advantages gained from interacting with the selected item.\n\n```**Interact with the item represented by '&' to potentially enhance movement or abilities that will aid in navigating through the enclosed area towards the goal while avoiding nearby threats.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding layout consists solely of walls denoted by 'b', and the area is largely enclosed. The initial state suggests all possible interactions are crucial to progress, particularly due to the compartmentalized nature of the environment.\n\n1. **Avatar's Location**: \n   - The avatar is flanked by walls on both the left and right sides, with no direct paths visible.\n   - The avatar has access to two interactive items marked with `&` adjacent on the same row. These items might be pivotal for the avatar\u2019s movement options and pathfinding toward the goal.\n\n2. **Surrounding Elements**:\n   - There are additional symbols in the vicinity: \n     - `*`, appearing in two locations, likely indicating passive elements or obstacles that could potentially become interacted with if modified by another item.\n     - At least two '@' symbols represent potential hazards to be avoided.\n     - The end goal has not been explicitly marked in the immediate visual scope but should remain the primary focus.\n\n3. **Environmental Constraints**: \n   - Given the obstruction created by the walls, there is a significant risk involved in navigating away from the avatar's current position unless further options are opened by interacting with the nearby objects.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\n\nConsidering the avatar's limitations and opportunities in the current environment, the next steps should focus on maximizing the potential of the items available for interaction:\n\n1. **Interaction Priority**:\n   - The best course of action is to interact with one of the items represented by `&`. This could provide necessary abilities or access to open routes that can potentially free the avatar from its current enclosure.\n\n2. **Expectations from Interaction**:\n   - The interaction with `&` could lead to the acquisition of a tool or ability that allows the player to manipulate surrounding elements (maybe the `*` or removing hazards such as `@`). This is essential for clearing a route or creating a safe passage forward.\n\n3. **Anticipating Hazards**:\n   - After interaction with the `&`, reassess the surrounding threats, particularly those represented by `@`, to ensure that any newly opened paths do not inadvertently jeopardize progress or safety.\n\n4. **Path toward the Goal**:\n   - Focus on enhancing pathways toward the goal located beyond the immediate confines. The interaction with `&` may determine the success of accessing areas where the goal is, by paving the way through newly available means.\n\n```**Interact with the item represented by '&' to potentially gain an ability that may open up new paths or remove hazards, facilitating a clearer route towards reaching the goal while avoiding dangers.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding environment shows the avatar's constraints due to walls and highlights potential actions through available items.\n\n1. **Avatar's Location**: \n   - The avatar is flanked on both sides by walls (b), indicating a lack of movement options. \n   - The only nearby interactive items are the two symbols represented by `&` and representatives of obstacles marked with `*`. \n\n2. **Surrounding Elements**:\n   - The items represented by `&` are crucial as they are positioned adjacent to the avatar's location. They potentially provide utility or allow the avatar to manipulate the environment further, revealing pathways or clearing obstacles.\n\n3. **Threat Assessment**: \n   - Hazards are identified by '@' nearby, representing possible threats when maneuvering.\n   - The overall enclosed nature of the space suggests that any movements or interactions must be carefully planned to avoid setbacks.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\n\nBased on this analysis, the next step should focus on leveraging the nearby interactive elements to open pathways and create opportunities for progression:\n\n1. **Item Interaction**:\n   - The immediate priority should be to interact with one of the items represented by `&`. This interaction may lead to acquiring new capabilities, allowing the avatar to overcome environmental restrictions or access previously blocked routes.\n\n2. **Flexibility for Future Moves**:\n   - By interacting with `&`, the avatar may gain the ability to manipulate surrounding obstacles, potentially converting the nearby `*` into usable tools or protective barriers against the hazardous threats represented by '@'.\n   \n3. **Hazard Management**:\n   - After interaction with the `&`, evaluate the surrounding hazards to ensure that the next moves do not leave the avatar vulnerable to the threats. Understand how the new ability or item can be utilized to enhance movement options and avoid engagement with hazards.\n\n4. **Path Forward to Goal**:\n   - The strategic focus remains on finding an efficient way to approach the goal. Any engagement with `&` should be analyzed for how it facilitates movement toward the actual goal, keeping a vigilant eye on the threats within the environment.\n\n```**Interact with the item represented by '&' to potentially gain a new ability or item that allows for better navigation through the enclosed area, enabling the avatar to avoid hazards and make progress towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

For example:\n     - Boulders can transform into a specific type when colliding with certain objects.\n     - The avatar interacts with objects to either shield itself or get knocked back.\n     - Laser interactions can cause the avatar to die if contacted directly.\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - The primary objective is to navigate the level and reach the goal (\u2018goal\u2019 sprite) represented by `0` on the map. Achieving this will score the player points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal with the avatar, which results in score changes positively (scoreChange=5).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is unable to continue (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0), meaning the avatar has either been defeated (collided with a laser) or no moves are possible.\n\n### Level Layout\n- The level consists of walls (denoted as `w`), open spaces (denoted by periods), the goal (`g`), the avatar (`A`), and laser cannons (`c`).\n- The layout is quite constraining, requiring strategic movement due to walls and various hazards.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify paths to the goal and avoid hazards.\n2. **Controlled Movement**: Focus on moving strategically rather than rushing. Observe laser patterns and determine safe moments to progress.\n3. **Use of Boxes**: Leverage boxes effectively; they can shield against frontal laser attacks and can be used to navigate around obstacles.\n4. **Object Interactions**: Experiment with object interactions. This includes using boulders to eliminate or avoid lasers and carefully managing your movement around passive obstacles that might block or obstruct paths.\n5. **Avoiding Hazards**: Plan routes that minimize contact with lasers. Since the avatar can be killed both frontally and non-frontally by lasers, ensure you are oriented away from them when passing by.\n6. **Goal-Oriented Play**: Your primary focus should always be towards reaching the goal. Evaluate the risk vs. reward of any action that could lead to being blocked or killed.\n\nBy following these strategic points, players should be able to navigate the challenges presented in the level effectively and reach the objective successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\nThe current situation indicates that the avatar ('a') is positioned at (11, 1) and is surrounded by walls ('b'). The immediate environment illustrates a lack of mobility options due to the broad enclosure of walls. Closest to the avatar are two critical interactive objects represented by `&`, and their successful engagement could unlock new pathways or abilities.\n\n1. **Avatar's Location**: \n   - The avatar is tightly contained without direct exits, making interactions with nearby objects necessary for progress.\n\n2. **Surrounding Elements**:\n   - The items represented by `&` are present adjacent to the avatar's position. Interacting with these `&` items is essential as they might provide new capabilities or enhancements to facilitate movement or circumvent the constraints imposed by the walls.\n\n3. **Threat Assessment**:\n   - There are multiple hazards in the form of `@` nearby, emphasizing the need for caution with interactions. Avoid engaging these threats while assessing how to move through the level safely.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\n\nGiven these observations, the plan should focus on interaction to incrementally advance toward the ultimate goal:\n\n1. **Interaction with `&`**:\n   - The highest priority should be to interact with one of the `&` items. This action could potentially grant the avatar new tools, powers, or skills that can aid in circumventing walls or hazards, enabling continued movement toward the goal.\n\n2. **Leveraging New Abilities**:\n   - If the `&` provides new abilities that enhance navigation or obstacle removal, it could additionally enable the avatar to mitigate nearby threats represented by `@`, providing a safer passage in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **Planning Future Moves**:\n   - After engaging with the `&`, reassess the surrounding area with the new abilities or items gained. This involves mapping out subsequent actions that use these abilities to outmaneuver hazards while keeping an eye on pathways leading towards the goal.\n\n4. **Dynamic Hazard Assessment**:\n   - Utilize the new item/ability effectively to bypass or deal with obstacles and hazards, ensuring movement toward the goal remains a consistent focal point.\n\n```**Interact with the item represented by '&' to gain an ability or item that may assist in navigating through the enclosed space and overcoming hazards, leading to clearer pathways toward the ultimate goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."

    "role": "response",
    "content": "``` Action:1 ``` \n\nI will interact with the item represented by `&`, as I expect this action will provide me with a crucial ability or item that allows for better navigation through the constrained environment and help circumvent nearby hazards. This aligns well with the strategy of utilizing immediate interactive elements to facilitate progress toward the goal."
