They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Move them to adjacent spaces to shield your avatar. If feasible, try to position them in a way that creates a blockade and enables you safe access around the hazardous lasers.\n\n4. **Timing Movements**:\n   - Carefully time movements to ensure you move when lasers are not active, leveraging any opportunities created by moving the boxes. If possible, wait for a gap created by the movement of a laser sprite and proceed quickly through that area.\n\n5. **Create Alternative Routes**:\n   - Instead of heading directly toward the goal, consider potential alternative routes that may appear less hazardous, especially along sides or around obstacles. Follow the path of least resistance.\n\n6. **Utilize Transformations**:\n   - Make use of the transformation mechanic if it comes into play. For example, if the avatar can change form when interacting with certain objects, determine how these changes can assist in navigating past hazards or reaching the goal safely.\n\n7. **Endgame Manipulation**:\n   - As you approach the goal, ensure that the final moves are calculated. Ensure no nearby hazards can impede your movement toward reaching `$`. Carefully gauge if any last-minute shield or block could be moved to facilitate your final step.\n\n8. **Monitor Life Counter**:\n   - Keep an eye on the number of lives left.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases.

Move them to adjacent spaces to shield your avatar. If feasible, try to position them in a way that creates a blockade and enables you safe access around the hazardous lasers.\n\n4. **Timing Movements**:\n   - Carefully time movements to ensure you move when lasers are not active, leveraging any opportunities created by moving the boxes. If possible, wait for a gap created by the movement of a laser sprite and proceed quickly through that area.\n\n5. **Create Alternative Routes**:\n   - Instead of heading directly toward the goal, consider potential alternative routes that may appear less hazardous, especially along sides or around obstacles. Follow the path of least resistance.\n\n6. **Utilize Transformations**:\n   - Make use of the transformation mechanic if it comes into play. For example, if the avatar can change form when interacting with certain objects, determine how these changes can assist in navigating past hazards or reaching the goal safely.\n\n7. **Endgame Manipulation**:\n   - As you approach the goal, ensure that the final moves are calculated. Ensure no nearby hazards can impede your movement toward reaching `$`. Carefully gauge if any last-minute shield or block could be moved to facilitate your final step.\n\n8. **Monitor Life Counter**:\n   - Keep an eye on the number of lives left.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Move them to adjacent spaces to shield your avatar. If feasible, try to position them in a way that creates a blockade and enables you safe access around the hazardous lasers.\n\n4. **Timing Movements**:\n   - Carefully time movements to ensure you move when lasers are not active, leveraging any opportunities created by moving the boxes. If possible, wait for a gap created by the movement of a laser sprite and proceed quickly through that area.\n\n5. **Create Alternative Routes**:\n   - Instead of heading directly toward the goal, consider potential alternative routes that may appear less hazardous, especially along sides or around obstacles. Follow the path of least resistance.\n\n6. **Utilize Transformations**:\n   - Make use of the transformation mechanic if it comes into play. For example, if the avatar can change form when interacting with certain objects, determine how these changes can assist in navigating past hazards or reaching the goal safely.\n\n7. **Endgame Manipulation**:\n   - As you approach the goal, ensure that the final moves are calculated. Ensure no nearby hazards can impede your movement toward reaching `$`. Carefully gauge if any last-minute shield or block could be moved to facilitate your final step.\n\n8. **Monitor Life Counter**:\n   - Keep an eye on the number of lives left.

They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**: \nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer with elements reminiscent of games like \"Sokoban\" or \"Spelunky.\" Given that it features movement mechanics, object manipulation, and a variety of sprites with different interactions, it falls into the puzzle genre with platforming elements. \n\n**Mechanics**:\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various immovable and movable objects (walls, boxes, boulders, lasers) that interact in different ways.\n- **Avatar**: The player controls an avatar that can move, interact with objects, and is subject to the rules of collision and interaction with the other sprites.\n- **Missiles**: Lasers and boulders function as both hazards and tools for solving puzzles. They can kill the avatar on contact based on its orientation.\n- **(objects transformations)**: The avatar can transform into different states based on interactions (e.g., turning into 'boulderm' when hit by a boulder).\n- **Goal**: The avatar aims to reach a designated goal to complete the level, which provides a score reward.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The main objective is to navigate the level, avoid or utilize hazards (lasers and boulders), and reach the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) to score points.\n- The player must solve puzzles by manipulating boxes and boulders to safely move through the stage while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the 'goal' sprite, which grants the player points.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The avatar runs out of lives, indicated by the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching 0 (resulting in a loss).\n  - The avatar may be \"killed\" by interacting with walls, lasers, or falling into holes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and positions of hazards and the goal. Determine the most strategic path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Use boxes to shield against frontal attacks from lasers. Move boulders or manipulate them to clear paths or create cover.\n\n3. **Hazard Awareness**: Be mindful of the laser sprites\u2014an alertness to their orientation is crucial, as they can kill the avatar depending on how the avatar approaches them. \n\n4. **Timing Movements**: Make precise movements when navigating areas with lasers to avoid being hit. Time your moves to pass when lasers are not in frontal orientation.\n\n5. **Transformations**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. If you get hit by a boulder, use the consequence to your advantage strategically. Pay attention to the potential to transform back to normal when interacting with certain sprites. \n\n6. **Strategy on Boulders**: Use the interaction mechanics creatively with the boulders, as they can attract gaze or kill sprites in certain cases. Manipulating them can help create safe paths.\n\n7. **Managing Lifespan**: Keep an eye on the count of your avatar sprite. Avoid unnecessary risks to conserve lives\u2014make calculated moves when approaching hazards.\n\n8. **Trial and Error**: If you lose a life or fail to reach the goal, use each attempt to learn the patterns of the sprites and the layout to more effectively plan your next move.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment and reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Look for gaps where the lasers are not present or where their pathways do not intersect with your route.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes & Boulders**:\n   - Use any available boxes (`c`) to strategically block laser paths, allowing safe navigation. Move them to adjacent spaces to shield your avatar. If feasible, try to position them in a way that creates a blockade and enables you safe access around the hazardous lasers.\n\n4. **Timing Movements**:\n   - Carefully time movements to ensure you move when lasers are not active, leveraging any opportunities created by moving the boxes. If possible, wait for a gap created by the movement of a laser sprite and proceed quickly through that area.\n\n5. **Create Alternative Routes**:\n   - Instead of heading directly toward the goal, consider potential alternative routes that may appear less hazardous, especially along sides or around obstacles. Follow the path of least resistance.\n\n6. **Utilize Transformations**:\n   - Make use of the transformation mechanic if it comes into play. For example, if the avatar can change form when interacting with certain objects, determine how these changes can assist in navigating past hazards or reaching the goal safely.\n\n7. **Endgame Manipulation**:\n   - As you approach the goal, ensure that the final moves are calculated. Ensure no nearby hazards can impede your movement toward reaching `$`. Carefully gauge if any last-minute shield or block could be moved to facilitate your final step.\n\n8. **Monitor Life Counter**:\n   - Keep an eye on the number of lives left. If the situation becomes overly risky, it may be wise to retreat to a safer position and reassess.
