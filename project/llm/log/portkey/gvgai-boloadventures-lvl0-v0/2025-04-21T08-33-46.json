It involves moving an avatar in a two-dimensional space, solving environmental puzzles, and avoiding dangers to reach an objective. Additionally, elements like lasers, boulders, and movement mechanics suggest a blend of platforming with strategic thinking.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which interacts with various objects and can be killed by lasers or when falling into holes.\n   - **Walls**: Immovable barriers that can cause the avatar to step back upon contact.\n   - **Lasers**: Projectiles that can kill the avatar when not approached appropriately (i.e., frontal vs. not frontal).\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: These can be moved around to create different scenarios and solve puzzles, either protecting the avatar or blocking lasers.\n   - **Goal**: The endpoint of the level, providing a score (win condition) when reached.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous zones that can kill both the avatar and boulders.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The interaction mechanics suggest strategic movement. Different objects affect the avatar and each other in various ways\u2014some help via shields, while others can cause harm (e.g., laser and boulders).\n   - The ability of boxes to shield from lasers indicates that positioning is crucial to survival and success.\n\n### Objectives\nThe primary goal is to lead the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding death from lasers, boulders, and falling into holes. Success is achieved by reaching the goal, indicated by obtaining a score change of +5. If the avatar count reaches zero, the player loses the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the goal (increase the score by 5).\n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - Avatar is killed by laser or hole (SpriteCounter reaches 0).\n  - The avatar can also die by being crushed by boulders if not maneuvered properly.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understanding the Layout**: Evaluate the level layout for obstacles, potential hazards (like lasers and holes), and safe paths to the goal. \n2. **Using Boxes Strategically**: Place boxes to block lasers or redirect boulders. Use them to shield the avatar effectively from oncoming attacks.\n3. **Dodge and Move**: When interacting with boulders or holes, careful movement is necessary to prevent fatal collisions. Utilize the walls to your advantage to manually maneuver the avatar.\n4. **Timing and Positioning**: Be mindful of the timing of lasers and plan movements such as dodging or hiding behind obstacles when they fire. Approach lasers from the correct orientation to prevent instant death.\n5. **Experimentation**: Given the puzzle nature, trial and error may help discover optimal paths or manipulate objects in favorable ways to remove obstacles or create shields.\n\nBy carefully navigating through the level while problem-solving with the interactive elements, players can successfully reach their goal while minimizing risk.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Here's how to approach the next step effectively:\n\n### Overview of Current State\n- The avatar is currently represented as '@' and is surrounded by various hazards, such as lasers ('*'), boulders ('%'), and walls ('#').\n- The goal is to navigate towards areas marked with '$' and additional potential movable assets ('&') and points of interest (also '@') while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Steps for the Next Move\n1. **Evaluate Surroundings**:\n   - Assess the immediate surrounding area for safe routes toward the goal and the potential for interaction with any movable objects (if the game allows).\n   - Identify the positioning of lasers and boulders to determine where to move the avatar safely.\n\n2. **Identify Safe Zones**:\n   - Look for tiles that are clear of hazards. The avatar should initially move toward spots that do not have lasers firing directly at them.\n\n3. **Strategic Movement**:\n   - If the avatar is near a group of lasers, prioritize moving in a way that prevents being directly exposed to them. If next to walls, use them as cover to navigate around threats.\n\n4. **Leverage Boxes**:\n   - Utilize movable objects ('&' or others) to create barriers against lasers or to push off obstacles.\n   - If applicable, move boxes in a position that can shield the avatar from oncoming lasers or redirect boulders.\n\n5. **Path to the Goal**:\n   - Plan the route to the goal ('$'). Depending on the layout, prioritize paths that are unobstructed by lasers or holes and allow quick maneuvering to avoid sudden hazards.\n  \n6. **Maintain Avatar Life**:\n   - Always keep an eye on the avatar's health/life status to avoid a game-over scenario. Carefully plot movements to prevent accidental deaths.\n   \n### Detailed Moves\nGiven the rules and mechanics above, here\u2019s an example of how to articulate the immediate next steps:\n\n1. **Assess Danger Zones**: \n   - The area marked with '@' should be scanned for immediate threats from lasers. Avoid moving without assessing the next few states.\n\n2. **Move to a Safer Position**:\n   - Move to an adjacent unblocked tile, ideally a tile covered by a box or wall to reduce risk from lasers.\n\n3. **Push Nearby Objects**:\n   - If there's an opportunity, push a box ('&') to create a barrier against the nearest laser.\n\n4. **Backup Options**:\n   - Always have a backup plan; if a direct route to the goal appears blocked, consider alternative routes or find the nearest \"safe\" spot to wait for the lasers to cycle.\n\n### Summary\nThe focus should be on anticipating the movements of hazards, utilizing environmental objects for protection, and working towards hitting the goal without congesting the avatar in a situation leading to death. By understanding the layout and using the strategic mechanics wisely, success can be achieved while navigating through the potential perils of the level.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"

Evaluate which direction avoids hazards. For instance, moving left or right might expose the avatar to lasers or boulders, while moving up or down may provide clearer routes.\n   - Ideally, your first move should be to navigate towards an area without immediate hazards. \n\n3. **Utilize Boxes**: \n   - If there are movable boxes ('&'), see if moving them can create barriers against threats or create new paths to the goal. If any boxes can be positioned to block lasers or create a safe step for the avatar, that should be prioritized.\n   - The boulders ('%') near the avatar should be considered for any further strategic moves.\n\n4. **Path Finding to Goal**:\n   - From the avatar's current position, begin planning the route towards the goal ('$'):\n     - Create a mental map highlighting the safest way to traverse across the level while accounting for the movement of lasers and blocks.\n     - If moving in the direction of the goal leads to danger, consider alternative routes or wait for a safe moment to proceed.\n\n5. **Timing and Movement Prediction**:\n   - Pay attention to the rhythm of lasers. If they have a predictable firing pattern, plan moves around these timing sequences.\n   - For instance, if lasers fire in intervals, use this to time your movements to either pass when lasers are off or duck behind cover when they are active.\n\n6. **Backup Plans**:\n   - Always have alternative strategies in case the primary route becomes blocked or hazardous. If you take a step and find it unfavorable, assess the next safest dodge or reversal to retreat to safety.\n\n### Specific Move Recommendations\nGiven the current layout:\n1. **Move Up**: Try moving the avatar up (if it's safe from lasers), which may provide new options for navigation without immediate threats.\n2. **Re-evaluate your Position**: After moving, check surrounding areas for potential hazards or opportunities to use boxes or planning your next move towards the goal.\n3. **Utilize Boxes Strategically**: If a box can be pushed from an adjacent tile, consider this as a preferred next action to block lasers if they are directly threatening a potential pathway.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe aim for the next step should be to prioritize movement that maintains safety while edging closer to the goal. Thoroughly evaluating surroundings and making strategic use of available objects can help successfully navigate toward a win while keeping the avatar alive. Always keep flexibility in mind, ready to adapt based on the outcomes of each movement.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```"
