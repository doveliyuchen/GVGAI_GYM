The presence of interactive elements that affect player movement and the need to navigate an arena filled with obstacles and hazards suggest it's a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game features an avatar that can move in a 2D space and must navigate a level to reach the goal. \n- There are various sprites including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals which create a dynamic environment.\n- Interaction between the avatar and other sprites is crucial, with many interactions having specific outcomes (e.g., being killed by lasers or transformed by boulders).\n- The use of a 'goal' sprite allows the player to score points and potentially win the game if they reach it successfully.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to reach the goal sprite to score points (5 points) while navigating through obstacles (walls, holes, and hazards like lasers). The game also includes managing interactions with other game elements like boulders and boxes to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning is achieved by reaching the goal sprite, which results in a score change (win condition).\n- Losing can occur if the avatar sprite's lifecycle count reaches zero, indicating that the player has either run out of lives or been defeated by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions Clearly:**\n   Familiarize yourself with all sprites and their interactions, particularly how they can be manipulated (for instance, boxes can shield from lasers, but if hit from certain angles, the avatar is killed).\n\n2. **Map Exploration:**\n   Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify key obstacles and potential hazards. Using the map to plan a route toward the goal while avoiding lasers and boulders is vital.\n\n3. **Safe Navigation:**\n   Move carefully around lasers and near holes. The game requires not just speed but strategic planning to avoid lethal interactions (such as approaching lasers from the side can result in being killed).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   Utilize available boxes as shields against lasers while navigating towards the goal. Remember that boxes can also bounce the avatar forward, potentially redirecting it toward safe areas or the goal.\n\n5. **Control Boulders:**\n   If boulders are present, use them to clear paths or create barriers. Note their interactions with walls and other sprites, particularly how they might help or hinder your advance to the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path:**\n   Calculate movements to ensure each action brings you closer to the goal. Avoid backtracking unless necessary to reposition against threats.\n\n7. **Watch the Sprite Counter:**\n   Monitor the appearance of your avatar sprite and adapt your gameplay if nearing the loss condition.

Observing the layout, the surrounding area contains walls that may block direct movement to the goal, requiring strategic interaction with nearby items.\n\n**Nearby Items Analysis:**\n1. The '@' symbols represent additional avatars or players, which may be utilized in some capacity, depending on the game's mechanics.\n2. The '%' symbols are potential hazards that can harm the avatar.\n3. The '&' symbol is unknown but could represent an interactive item that may provide a strategic advantage or a means of progressing toward the goal.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n- **Interaction with the Item '&':** The item '&' is situated at (4, 11) and could potentially either grant access to new pathways or provide a tool to navigate through the hazards. Interacting with the '&' symbol should be prioritized as it may unlock new routes or capabilities.\n\n- **Evaluate Outcomes:** After interacting with '&', assess how it modifies the avatar\u2019s capabilities or the environment. If it clears nearby hazards or alters obstacles, it could open up a path toward the goal.\n\n- **Reassess and Plan Movement:** Depending on the outcome of the interaction, devise a new path towards reaching the goal. If the interaction yields a means to safely traverse hazards or access blocked areas, prioritize utilizing it effectively.\n\n- **Route Optimization:** Analyze the new layout once the item has been used. Move intelligently, ensuring every step is directed toward minimizing risk and maximizing the likelihood of scoring through the goal.\n\nBy focusing on interacting with the item '&', the player can leverage potential benefits that may facilitate overcoming obstacles and pave the way to progress towards the goal. \n\n```**Interact with the item '&' to potentially unlock new pathways or capabilities that can assist in reaching the goal more effectively.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The new map state introduces significant changes, including solid blockades that eliminate escape routes or pathways previously accessible. The goal at (11, 11) remains the primary objective, but the surroundings must be navigated more strategically due to the presence of walls and hazards.\n\n**Current Status:** \n- Interaction with the item '&' at (4, 11) has yet to manifest any visible effect. It appears there are two '&' items available, which may need activating to understand the advantages they provide.\n- The presence of '%' symbols at (2, 19) and elsewhere indicates hazardous points that must be avoided in any strategical movement.\n- The goal '$' is located at (11, 11), and reaching it is paramount for scoring points.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Engage with the Item '&':** \n   The first priority in this state should be to interact with one of the '&' items. It\u2019s crucial to ascertain how these items impact the current level's layout and what interactions they may grant access to. \n\n2. **Observe Changes Post-Interaction:**\n   After interacting with '&', closely observe any modifications in the environment. This may uncover new paths, alter hazard placements, self-transform the avatar or offer other strategic benefits.\n\n3. **Prioritize Safe Movements:**\n   Depending on the outcome of the first '&' interaction, plan movements that keep the avatar clear of hazards as well as enclosed by walls. Avoid paths leading diagonally toward '%' until the situation is clarified.\n\n4. **Assess risk vs. reward:** \n   If the interaction provides items or abilities that can counteract or mitigate the hazards, identify a safe route to exploit this advantage toward the goal.\n\n5. **Continuous Evaluation:**\n   Maintain an ongoing assessment of both avatar health and hazard locations. Adjust approaches as necessary after any engagement with the environment. If one '&' does not yield beneficial results, consider attempting to interact with the second '&'.\n\nFocusing on the '&' items can yield significant advantages in navigating this closed-off and potentially hazardous environment toward achieving the game\u2019s primary objective.\n\n```**Interact with one of the '&' items to uncover potential pathways or advantages that may assist in navigating towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal '$' is positioned at (11, 11), but progressing toward this goal is complicated by hazards like '%' and walls blocking direct paths. The game environment is confined, and careful navigation is required to ensure safety while pursuing the goal.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The avatar is directly adjacent to two interactive items marked as '&'. \n- Interacting with one of these '&' items may provide benefits that could alter the current landscape or allow the avatar some capability to navigate past hazards more effectively.\n- The hazardous '%' symbols indicate potentially lethal areas that should be avoided unless some interaction provides a means to negate their effect.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Interact with the Item '&':** \n   The primary action should be to interact with one of the '&' items. These items are critical to understanding potential pathways and advantages in the current state. Since two '&' items are at (4, 11) and (4, 12), choose one to maximize the potential for beneficial outcomes.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Result of the Interaction:**\n   After engaging with the '&' item, determine how it impacts the immediate environment. \n   - If it opens pathways or provides tools/resources to counter or bypass hazards, prioritize using this new advantage.\n   - Pay attention to any alterations regarding the positioning of walls or where hazards are located.\n\n3. **If Required, Engage the Second '&':**\n   If the first interaction yields minimal benefits or does not clear any pathways, consider interacting with the second '&'. This may introduce new tactical options or significantly enhance the ability to navigate toward the goal.\n\n4. **Strategize Path to Goal:**\n   Based on the outcomes of the engagements with '&', plan the next moves carefully to ensure they are directed towards minimizing contact with hazards (%), utilizing any new pathways opened up by interacting with the items, and progressing toward the goal.\n\n5. **Continuous Observation and Adjustments:**\n   Monitor the state of the environment continually. Adjust strategies as needed based on new information gained from interacting with the '&' items. Ensure to avoid backtracking that may lead toward hazards unnecessarily.\n\nBy focusing on the '&' items, the player can exploit potential opportunities that will facilitate not only reaching the goal but doing so with as little risk as possible.\n\n```**Interact with one of the '&' items to uncover possible advantages or pathways that may assist in navigating safely toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The walls ('b') restrict movement options significantly. The position of the goal ('$') at (11, 11) remains far from reachable without careful planning. Hazards represented by '%' are also present, which must be avoided to ensure the avatar's safety.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The two '&' items are still located at (4, 11) and (4, 12). These items represent potential opportunities that can alter the current constraints or provide advantages in navigating toward the goal.\n- The walls surrounding the avatar mean that moving directly toward the goal isn't possible currently. Finding a way to interact with the '&' items could reveal pathways or abilities that allow the avatar to advance.\n- Other avatars ('@') present in the environment may impact the strategic dynamics, depending on the game's rules regarding their interactions.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Interact with the '&' Item:**\n   The primary approach should be to interact with one of the '&' items located at (4, 11) or (4, 12). Engaging with these items is crucial, as they may provide necessary modifications to the environment, open new paths, or grant items that can enhance navigation or obstacle management.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Impact of Interaction:**\n   After engaging with the '&', take note of any changes in the environment. If the item activates pathways or assists in modifying hazard locations, utilize this benefit immediately to move closer to the goal.\n\n3. **If Necessary, Engage the Second '&':**\n   If the first interaction yields insufficient benefits (for instance, if it does not open paths or mitigate hazards), consider interacting with the second '&' item for additional opportunities.\n\n4. **Adapt Strategy Based on Outcomes:**\n   Based on the effects of both interactions, continually reassess the situation. Identify newly available routes and cultivate a movement plan that utilizes any newly gained advantages while avoiding hazardous '%'.\n\n5. **Prepare for Potential Challenges:**\n   If the '&' interactions lead to beneficial outcomes, plan maneuvers that ensure the avatar remains clear of any walls or hazards. Each action should incrementally progress toward reaching the goal without unnecessary risks.\n\nBy prioritizing an interaction with the '&' items, the player can uncover pathways or tools that will facilitate gradual movement toward the goal.\n\n```**Interact with one of the '&' items to potentially unlock pathways or gain abilities that facilitate navigation toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of interactive elements that affect player movement and the need to navigate an arena filled with obstacles and hazards suggest it's a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game features an avatar that can move in a 2D space and must navigate a level to reach the goal. \n- There are various sprites including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals which create a dynamic environment.\n- Interaction between the avatar and other sprites is crucial, with many interactions having specific outcomes (e.g., being killed by lasers or transformed by boulders).\n- The use of a 'goal' sprite allows the player to score points and potentially win the game if they reach it successfully.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to reach the goal sprite to score points (5 points) while navigating through obstacles (walls, holes, and hazards like lasers). The game also includes managing interactions with other game elements like boulders and boxes to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning is achieved by reaching the goal sprite, which results in a score change (win condition).\n- Losing can occur if the avatar sprite's lifecycle count reaches zero, indicating that the player has either run out of lives or been defeated by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions Clearly:**\n   Familiarize yourself with all sprites and their interactions, particularly how they can be manipulated (for instance, boxes can shield from lasers, but if hit from certain angles, the avatar is killed).\n\n2. **Map Exploration:**\n   Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify key obstacles and potential hazards. Using the map to plan a route toward the goal while avoiding lasers and boulders is vital.\n\n3. **Safe Navigation:**\n   Move carefully around lasers and near holes. The game requires not just speed but strategic planning to avoid lethal interactions (such as approaching lasers from the side can result in being killed).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   Utilize available boxes as shields against lasers while navigating towards the goal. Remember that boxes can also bounce the avatar forward, potentially redirecting it toward safe areas or the goal.\n\n5. **Control Boulders:**\n   If boulders are present, use them to clear paths or create barriers. Note their interactions with walls and other sprites, particularly how they might help or hinder your advance to the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path:**\n   Calculate movements to ensure each action brings you closer to the goal. Avoid backtracking unless necessary to reposition against threats.\n\n7. **Watch the Sprite Counter:**\n   Monitor the appearance of your avatar sprite and adapt your gameplay if nearing the loss condition. Try to maintain a strategy that conserves your avatar's integrity until you can maximize your score through the goal.\n\n8. **Practice Preventive Movements:**\n   Execute movements that can anticipate the dangers ahead and allow for quick retreats if needed, especially after engaging with interactive sprites.\n\nBy combining these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid hazards, and reach the goal, optimizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The goal ('$') is at (11, 11), and the area is surrounded by various hazards ('%'). There are also two '&' items in the vicinity at (4, 11) and (4, 12). Effectively navigating this space requires careful consideration, especially in maneuvering around obstacles and finding ways to interact with the items to progress.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The presence of walls means that the avatar cannot move into certain areas freely and must find ways to use interactive elements.\n- Interacting with the '&' items may provide significant gameplay advantages, either by unlocking new pathways or providing tools to bypass existing hazards.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Interact with One of the '&' Items:**\n   Prioritize interacting with one of the '&' items located at (4, 11) or (4, 12). These items may yield critical benefits that can alter the navigation dynamics or provide necessary tools for avoiding hazards.\n\n2. **Assess the Outcome:**\n   Once an interaction with an '&' item is executed, evaluate any changes in the environment. This could include newly available routes, removal of hazards, or acquisition of abilities that can assist in navigating toward the goal.\n\n3. **If Required, Engage the Second '&':**\n   If the first engagement with the '&' does not provide favorable outcomes or opportunities, consider interacting with the second '&' item for further chances to gain strategic advantages.\n\n4. **Plan Subsequent Actions:**\n   Based on the results of the '&' interactions, establish a movement strategy that takes into account newly accessible areas, while avoiding the hazardous '%' areas. Continuous adjustments to plan should be made based on the evolving environment.\n\n5. **Utilize New Pathways:**\n   If any pathways are opened or cleared as a result of interactions with the '&' items, take advantage of these options to move closer to the goal while minimizing exposure to hazards.\n\nBy focusing on the '&' items, the player can potentially unlock new capabilities that will facilitate movement towards the goal while ensuring safety from hazards.\n\n```**Interact with one of the '&' items to potentially unlock new pathways or gain advantages that will help navigate the hazards towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal ('$') at (11, 11) is still far from immediate reach, primarily due to multiple hazards ('%') and wall obstacles. The layout informs us that the player must carefully plan their next steps if they hope to progress toward the goal.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The two '&' items are still available for interaction, located at (4, 11) and (4, 12). Engaging with these items is critical. They may offer new capabilities, open alternative paths, or assist in bypassing hazards.\n- The surroundings of the avatar constrain movement significantly; therefore, figuring out how to leverage the available items is paramount.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Prioritize Interaction with the '&' Item:**\n   Focus on interacting with one of the '&' items (either at (4, 11) or (4, 12)). Since these items might provide important advantages or clear paths, engaging them should be the next actionable step.\n\n2. **Analyze the Results of the Interaction:**\n   After interacting with one of the '&' symbols, carefully observe the changes in the environment. Look for newly accessible paths, the removal of obstacles, or other modifications that may facilitate movement toward the goal.\n\n3. **Consider Engaging the Second '&' Item if Necessary:**\n   If the first '&' interaction does not yield sufficient benefits or does not facilitate movement options, proceed to engage the second '&' item. This increases the chance of gaining critical advantages for navigating the current environment.\n\n4. **Adjust Movement Strategy:**\n   Depending on the outcomes gained from the interaction with the '&' items, create a movement strategy that prioritizes using newly opened routes and avoiding hazards optimally. \n\n5. **Continue Monitoring the Environment:**\n   Keep an ongoing assessment of both the avatar's status and the surrounding hazards. After the item interactions, reassess any available paths that lead toward the goal and make necessary adjustments as new opportunities arise.\n\nEngaging with the '&' items is crucial in potentially transforming the path scenario toward reaching the goal, enabling safer traversal with fewer obstacles.\n\n```**Interact with one of the '&' items to unlock new pathways or gain advantages that can assist in navigating toward the goal efficiently.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal ('$') is at (11, 11), suggesting that the avatar needs to navigate carefully through the surrounding obstacles to reach it. The presence of two interactive items marked '&' at (4, 11) and (4, 12) offers an opportunity for advantageous interactions.\n\n**Current State Observations:**\n- The walls ('b') prevent any upward or lateral movement from the current position of the avatar, which highlights the need for strategic interactions with the '&' items to find potential pathways or advantages.\n- Interacting with the '&' items may reveal new routes or provide changes beneficial for overall progress, possibly mitigating surrounding hazards ('%').\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Interact with the '&' Item:**\n   Focus on engaging with one of the '&' items. Their interaction is pivotal, as they may uncover new paths, remove hazards, or provide abilities that enhance maneuverability.\n\n2. **Assess Changes After Interaction:**\n   Observe any modifications in the environment following the interaction. Look for newly accessible areas or shifts in danger that could allow for movement toward the goal.\n\n3. **If Needed, Engage the Second '&':**\n   Should the result of the first '&' interaction not provide significant pathways or advantages, consider interacting with the second '&'. This expands the chances of creating viable movement options toward the goal.\n\n4. **Leverage Any New Advantages:**\n   Depending on the outcomes from engaging the '&' items, utilize any opened pathways or gained abilities effectively to progress closer to the goal while evading hazards.\n\n5. **Adapt Strategy Continuously:**\n   Maintain flexibility in strategy based on real-time observations of the environment post-interaction.

The primary goal is located at (11, 11), which signifies that reaching this target requires careful planning and interaction with the environment, especially considering there are obstacles and hazards nearby. There are two '&' items available at (4, 11) and (4, 12) that can potentially assist in navigating toward the goal.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The walls create a confined space, restricting movement options for the avatar. Engaging with the '&' items could help manipulate the environment or provide tools for progress.\n- The presence of numerous '%' symbols suggests needing to avoid those hazards as any contact could result in losing the avatar's life.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Prioritize Interaction with the '&' Item:**\n   Engage with one of the '&' items located at (4, 11) or (4, 12). This is a critical move as it may uncover new pathways or grant the avatar abilities that can aid in navigation and avoiding hazards.\n\n2. **Evaluate Post-Interaction Changes:**\n   After interacting with the selected '&' item, carefully assess any changes to the environment. Watch for new openings, the removal of hazards, or new tools that can be utilized to advance towards the goal.\n\n3. **Consider Engaging the Second '&' Item:**\n   If the first interaction does not significantly aid in progress\u2014such as not opening pathways or heralding beneficial changes\u2014then interact with the second '&' item to look for more possible advantages.\n\n4. **Adapt Movement Strategy Based on Results:**\n   Use the results of the interactions with the '&' items to adjust your path toward the goal. Identify which newly accessible routes are safest and most direct, avoiding any lingering hazards.\n\n5. **Continuously Assess the Environment:**\n   As you progress, maintain an ongoing evaluation of the environment. Stay alert for any further opportunities to engage with items or interact with the configuration of walls or hazards.\n\nBy focusing on the '&' items, the player can leverage these opportunities to reconfigure their path toward the goal, mitigating the dangers presented by the hazards and walls.\n\n```**Interact with one of the '&' items to unlock potential pathways or gain advantages to assist in navigating toward the goal effectively.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of interactive elements that affect player movement and the need to navigate an arena filled with obstacles and hazards suggest it's a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game features an avatar that can move in a 2D space and must navigate a level to reach the goal. \n- There are various sprites including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals which create a dynamic environment.\n- Interaction between the avatar and other sprites is crucial, with many interactions having specific outcomes (e.g., being killed by lasers or transformed by boulders).\n- The use of a 'goal' sprite allows the player to score points and potentially win the game if they reach it successfully.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to reach the goal sprite to score points (5 points) while navigating through obstacles (walls, holes, and hazards like lasers). The game also includes managing interactions with other game elements like boulders and boxes to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning is achieved by reaching the goal sprite, which results in a score change (win condition).\n- Losing can occur if the avatar sprite's lifecycle count reaches zero, indicating that the player has either run out of lives or been defeated by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions Clearly:**\n   Familiarize yourself with all sprites and their interactions, particularly how they can be manipulated (for instance, boxes can shield from lasers, but if hit from certain angles, the avatar is killed).\n\n2. **Map Exploration:**\n   Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify key obstacles and potential hazards. Using the map to plan a route toward the goal while avoiding lasers and boulders is vital.\n\n3. **Safe Navigation:**\n   Move carefully around lasers and near holes. The game requires not just speed but strategic planning to avoid lethal interactions (such as approaching lasers from the side can result in being killed).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   Utilize available boxes as shields against lasers while navigating towards the goal. Remember that boxes can also bounce the avatar forward, potentially redirecting it toward safe areas or the goal.\n\n5. **Control Boulders:**\n   If boulders are present, use them to clear paths or create barriers. Note their interactions with walls and other sprites, particularly how they might help or hinder your advance to the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path:**\n   Calculate movements to ensure each action brings you closer to the goal. Avoid backtracking unless necessary to reposition against threats.\n\n7. **Watch the Sprite Counter:**\n   Monitor the appearance of your avatar sprite and adapt your gameplay if nearing the loss condition. Try to maintain a strategy that conserves your avatar's integrity until you can maximize your score through the goal.\n\n8. **Practice Preventive Movements:**\n   Execute movements that can anticipate the dangers ahead and allow for quick retreats if needed, especially after engaging with interactive sprites.\n\nBy combining these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid hazards, and reach the goal, optimizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The goal ('$') is at (11, 11), which requires careful navigation. The two interactive items, '&', are located at (4, 11) and (4, 12). These items may offer crucial advantages for progressing through the hazardous environment.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The walls prevent lateral movement, restricting the avatar's options for direct action or escape routes.\n- The hazards need to be avoided at all costs since they can severely affect the avatar\u2019s life count and progress in the game.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Interact with the '&' Items:**\n   Engage both '&' items located at (4, 11) and (4, 12). Given the current conditions and previously unsuccessful strategy, it\u2019s essential to determine if either of these items can create pathways or remove hazards that are blocking progress.\n\n2. **Monitor the Effects of Each Interaction:**\n   After engaging with each '&' item, closely observe any changes in the environment. These changes might include new pathways becoming available, clearance of hazards, or acquiring useful tools or abilities that could aid movement toward the goal.\n\n3. **Adapt Strategy Based on New Information:**\n   Utilize any new pathways or tools obtained from the '&' interactions to formulate a strategic plan that optimally directs the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n4. **Constantly Reassess the Environment:**\n   Following each interaction with the '&' items, continuously assess the overall layout and safety of potential routes. Being adaptable will help navigate unforeseen challenges while progressing toward the goal.\n\n5. **Stay Aware of Hazards:**\n   Keep an eye on the remaining hazards and walls after interactions. Ensure that movement choices are cautious and calculated to maintain avatar safety as one approaches the goal.\n\nBy focusing on engaging with both '&' items, the player may unlock advantages necessary for navigating the tightly confined space and advancing toward the ultimate objective.\n\n```**Interact with both '&' items to determine potential pathways or advantages that will assist in navigating effectively toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of interactive elements that affect player movement and the need to navigate an arena filled with obstacles and hazards suggest it's a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game features an avatar that can move in a 2D space and must navigate a level to reach the goal. \n- There are various sprites including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals which create a dynamic environment.\n- Interaction between the avatar and other sprites is crucial, with many interactions having specific outcomes (e.g., being killed by lasers or transformed by boulders).\n- The use of a 'goal' sprite allows the player to score points and potentially win the game if they reach it successfully.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to reach the goal sprite to score points (5 points) while navigating through obstacles (walls, holes, and hazards like lasers). The game also includes managing interactions with other game elements like boulders and boxes to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning is achieved by reaching the goal sprite, which results in a score change (win condition).\n- Losing can occur if the avatar sprite's lifecycle count reaches zero, indicating that the player has either run out of lives or been defeated by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions Clearly:**\n   Familiarize yourself with all sprites and their interactions, particularly how they can be manipulated (for instance, boxes can shield from lasers, but if hit from certain angles, the avatar is killed).\n\n2. **Map Exploration:**\n   Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify key obstacles and potential hazards. Using the map to plan a route toward the goal while avoiding lasers and boulders is vital.\n\n3. **Safe Navigation:**\n   Move carefully around lasers and near holes. The game requires not just speed but strategic planning to avoid lethal interactions (such as approaching lasers from the side can result in being killed).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   Utilize available boxes as shields against lasers while navigating towards the goal. Remember that boxes can also bounce the avatar forward, potentially redirecting it toward safe areas or the goal.\n\n5. **Control Boulders:**\n   If boulders are present, use them to clear paths or create barriers. Note their interactions with walls and other sprites, particularly how they might help or hinder your advance to the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path:**\n   Calculate movements to ensure each action brings you closer to the goal. Avoid backtracking unless necessary to reposition against threats.\n\n7. **Watch the Sprite Counter:**\n   Monitor the appearance of your avatar sprite and adapt your gameplay if nearing the loss condition. Try to maintain a strategy that conserves your avatar's integrity until you can maximize your score through the goal.\n\n8. **Practice Preventive Movements:**\n   Execute movements that can anticipate the dangers ahead and allow for quick retreats if needed, especially after engaging with interactive sprites.\n\nBy combining these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid hazards, and reach the goal, optimizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The presence of interactive elements that affect player movement and the need to navigate an arena filled with obstacles and hazards suggest it's a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game features an avatar that can move in a 2D space and must navigate a level to reach the goal. \n- There are various sprites including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals which create a dynamic environment.\n- Interaction between the avatar and other sprites is crucial, with many interactions having specific outcomes (e.g., being killed by lasers or transformed by boulders).\n- The use of a 'goal' sprite allows the player to score points and potentially win the game if they reach it successfully.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to reach the goal sprite to score points (5 points) while navigating through obstacles (walls, holes, and hazards like lasers). The game also includes managing interactions with other game elements like boulders and boxes to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning is achieved by reaching the goal sprite, which results in a score change (win condition).\n- Losing can occur if the avatar sprite's lifecycle count reaches zero, indicating that the player has either run out of lives or been defeated by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions Clearly:**\n   Familiarize yourself with all sprites and their interactions, particularly how they can be manipulated (for instance, boxes can shield from lasers, but if hit from certain angles, the avatar is killed).\n\n2. **Map Exploration:**\n   Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify key obstacles and potential hazards. Using the map to plan a route toward the goal while avoiding lasers and boulders is vital.\n\n3. **Safe Navigation:**\n   Move carefully around lasers and near holes. The game requires not just speed but strategic planning to avoid lethal interactions (such as approaching lasers from the side can result in being killed).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   Utilize available boxes as shields against lasers while navigating towards the goal. Remember that boxes can also bounce the avatar forward, potentially redirecting it toward safe areas or the goal.\n\n5. **Control Boulders:**\n   If boulders are present, use them to clear paths or create barriers. Note their interactions with walls and other sprites, particularly how they might help or hinder your advance to the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path:**\n   Calculate movements to ensure each action brings you closer to the goal. Avoid backtracking unless necessary to reposition against threats.\n\n7. **Watch the Sprite Counter:**\n   Monitor the appearance of your avatar sprite and adapt your gameplay if nearing the loss condition. Try to maintain a strategy that conserves your avatar's integrity until you can maximize your score through the goal.\n\n8. **Practice Preventive Movements:**\n   Execute movements that can anticipate the dangers ahead and allow for quick retreats if needed, especially after engaging with interactive sprites.\n\nBy combining these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid hazards, and reach the goal, optimizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The presence of interactive elements that affect player movement and the need to navigate an arena filled with obstacles and hazards suggest it's a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game features an avatar that can move in a 2D space and must navigate a level to reach the goal. \n- There are various sprites including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals which create a dynamic environment.\n- Interaction between the avatar and other sprites is crucial, with many interactions having specific outcomes (e.g., being killed by lasers or transformed by boulders).\n- The use of a 'goal' sprite allows the player to score points and potentially win the game if they reach it successfully.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to reach the goal sprite to score points (5 points) while navigating through obstacles (walls, holes, and hazards like lasers). The game also includes managing interactions with other game elements like boulders and boxes to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning is achieved by reaching the goal sprite, which results in a score change (win condition).\n- Losing can occur if the avatar sprite's lifecycle count reaches zero, indicating that the player has either run out of lives or been defeated by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions Clearly:**\n   Familiarize yourself with all sprites and their interactions, particularly how they can be manipulated (for instance, boxes can shield from lasers, but if hit from certain angles, the avatar is killed).\n\n2. **Map Exploration:**\n   Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify key obstacles and potential hazards. Using the map to plan a route toward the goal while avoiding lasers and boulders is vital.\n\n3. **Safe Navigation:**\n   Move carefully around lasers and near holes. The game requires not just speed but strategic planning to avoid lethal interactions (such as approaching lasers from the side can result in being killed).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   Utilize available boxes as shields against lasers while navigating towards the goal. Remember that boxes can also bounce the avatar forward, potentially redirecting it toward safe areas or the goal.\n\n5. **Control Boulders:**\n   If boulders are present, use them to clear paths or create barriers. Note their interactions with walls and other sprites, particularly how they might help or hinder your advance to the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path:**\n   Calculate movements to ensure each action brings you closer to the goal. Avoid backtracking unless necessary to reposition against threats.\n\n7. **Watch the Sprite Counter:**\n   Monitor the appearance of your avatar sprite and adapt your gameplay if nearing the loss condition. Try to maintain a strategy that conserves your avatar's integrity until you can maximize your score through the goal.\n\n8. **Practice Preventive Movements:**\n   Execute movements that can anticipate the dangers ahead and allow for quick retreats if needed, especially after engaging with interactive sprites.\n\nBy combining these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid hazards, and reach the goal, optimizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(1, 11)\n=== Last Position ===\n(1,11)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\nThe avatar 'a' is currently at (1, 11) surrounded by walls ('b') with various hazards ('%') nearby. The goal ('$') is at (11, 11). Given the avatar's position, movement options are severely limited, making it essential to interact with the two '&' items, located at (4, 11) and (4, 12). These items are pivotal in facilitating progression.\n\n#### Key Observations:\n- The walls block lateral movement, necessitating effective engagement with one or both '&' items to create new paths.\n- Hazards are positioned nearby, posing threats that need to be avoided at all costs.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Engage the '&' Items:**\n   Prioritize engaging with one of the '&' items, starting with the one at (4, 11). This interaction is crucial for potentially unlocking new pathways or altering the environment favorably.\n\n2. **Assess Changes Following Interaction:**\n   After interacting with the first '&' item, evaluate any changes in the environment, looking for:\n   - Newly accessible paths\n   - Altered positions of hazards\n   - Any bonuses or tools acquired that can assist in further navigation\n\n3. **Interact with the Second '&' Item if Necessary:**\n   If the first '&' interaction does not provide substantial benefits, proceed to engage the second '&' item at (4, 12). This increases the chances of achieving favorable outcomes that could facilitate movement.\n\n4. **Adapt Movement Strategy Based on New Information:**\n   Use insights gained from the '&' interactions to update your movement plan, focusing on identifying the safest routes toward the goal based on newly opened pathways or hazards that have been removed.\n\n5. **Maintain Vigilance Toward Hazards:**\n   Continuously assess the remaining hazards in the environment after engaging with the items. Ensure that the routes taken minimize contact with hazards, maintaining the avatar's integrity as it progresses toward the goal.\n\nBy effectively engaging with the '&' items, the player can unlock critical pathways or gain advantages necessary for navigating the surroundings and achieving the objective.\n\n```**Interact with both '&' items to potentially unlock pathways or gain advantages that will assist in navigating effectively toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy."
