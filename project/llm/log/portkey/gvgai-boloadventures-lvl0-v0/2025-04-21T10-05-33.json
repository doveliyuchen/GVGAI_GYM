    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules and level layout, the game appears to fit within the **puzzle-platformer** genre. The combination of sprite interactions, ignoring traditional combat dynamics, and a goal-oriented structure point toward a game focused on problem-solving and strategic movement rather than direct conflict.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game employs several key mechanics:\n\n1. **Movement & Interactions**: The avatar interacts with various objects (walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, holes) that can lead to different outcomes affecting the avatar's state and movement. \n2. **Transformations & Kill Conditions**:\n   - Interacting with certain sprites leads to transformations, such as the avatar being transformed into a boulderm (a projectile).\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar depending on the frontal or non-frontal interactions, introducing a risk-reward element.\n3. **Scoring System**: Players can achieve a score change through specific interactions (like killing with a laser or entering the goal with the avatar).\n4. **Termination Conditions**: Winning requires interacting with the goal sprite, while losing can result from the avatar being eliminated or reaching a sprite counter limit (likely related to levels).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be reaching the 'goal' sprite while navigating a maze-like level filled with various challenges and potential hazards, while possibly collecting points through specific actions. The goal leads to a win condition, whereas the death of the avatar or reaching zero on the sprite counter results in a loss.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar successfully reaches the goal sprite, which contributes to the score.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the avatar encounters hazards (like the lasers or if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Planning Movements**:\n   - Before making any moves, evaluate the layout and the positions of hazards (lasers), boulders, and exit routes.\n   - Use available objects (e.g., boxes and walls) as shields against lasers or to manipulate other sprites (boulders).\n\n2. **Leveraging Sprite Interactions**:\n   - Take advantage of interactions between different sprites to protect yourself from hazards. For example, using boxes as shields when approaching a laser.\n   - Remember that being turned into a boulderm after colliding with one can put the avatar in a dangerous situation; navigate carefully.\n\n3. **Use the Environment**:\n   - Walls can be employed tactically to block lasers or to bounce off of boxes instead of moving directly towards hazards. \n   - Identify paths that minimize risk (i.e., always check destroyable/transforming sprites in the environment).\n\n4. **Score Consideration**:\n   - While reaching the goal is crucial, the scoring mechanic could encourage taking risks for additional points (e.g., purposely activating laser kills).\n   - Balancing between going for points and safely navigating to the goal will be vital.\n\n5. **Adaptability**:\n   - As different interactions can lead to unexpected results (e.g., bouncing forward), players should be prepared to adapt their strategy mid-move based on interactions.\n\nBy focusing on movement strategy, leveraging the environment, and carefully navigating interactions with objects, players should be able to optimize their path to the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=0, x=0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Next Strategy Step**: Move the avatar to the right to interact with the box and strategically position it to block potential laser hazards on your path to the goal; if the state does not change after this action, consider moving back and trying an alternative route.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The combination of sprite interactions, ignoring traditional combat dynamics, and a goal-oriented structure point toward a game focused on problem-solving and strategic movement rather than direct conflict.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game employs several key mechanics:\n\n1. **Movement & Interactions**: The avatar interacts with various objects (walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, holes) that can lead to different outcomes affecting the avatar's state and movement. \n2. **Transformations & Kill Conditions**:\n   - Interacting with certain sprites leads to transformations, such as the avatar being transformed into a boulderm (a projectile).\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar depending on the frontal or non-frontal interactions, introducing a risk-reward element.\n3. **Scoring System**: Players can achieve a score change through specific interactions (like killing with a laser or entering the goal with the avatar).\n4. **Termination Conditions**: Winning requires interacting with the goal sprite, while losing can result from the avatar being eliminated or reaching a sprite counter limit (likely related to levels).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be reaching the 'goal' sprite while navigating a maze-like level filled with various challenges and potential hazards, while possibly collecting points through specific actions.

The combination of sprite interactions, ignoring traditional combat dynamics, and a goal-oriented structure point toward a game focused on problem-solving and strategic movement rather than direct conflict.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game employs several key mechanics:\n\n1. **Movement & Interactions**: The avatar interacts with various objects (walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, holes) that can lead to different outcomes affecting the avatar's state and movement. \n2. **Transformations & Kill Conditions**:\n   - Interacting with certain sprites leads to transformations, such as the avatar being transformed into a boulderm (a projectile).\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar depending on the frontal or non-frontal interactions, introducing a risk-reward element.\n3. **Scoring System**: Players can achieve a score change through specific interactions (like killing with a laser or entering the goal with the avatar).\n4. **Termination Conditions**: Winning requires interacting with the goal sprite, while losing can result from the avatar being eliminated or reaching a sprite counter limit (likely related to levels).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be reaching the 'goal' sprite while navigating a maze-like level filled with various challenges and potential hazards, while possibly collecting points through specific actions.

The combination of sprite interactions, ignoring traditional combat dynamics, and a goal-oriented structure point toward a game focused on problem-solving and strategic movement rather than direct conflict.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game employs several key mechanics:\n\n1. **Movement & Interactions**: The avatar interacts with various objects (walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, holes) that can lead to different outcomes affecting the avatar's state and movement. \n2. **Transformations & Kill Conditions**:\n   - Interacting with certain sprites leads to transformations, such as the avatar being transformed into a boulderm (a projectile).\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar depending on the frontal or non-frontal interactions, introducing a risk-reward element.\n3. **Scoring System**: Players can achieve a score change through specific interactions (like killing with a laser or entering the goal with the avatar).\n4. **Termination Conditions**: Winning requires interacting with the goal sprite, while losing can result from the avatar being eliminated or reaching a sprite counter limit (likely related to levels).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be reaching the 'goal' sprite while navigating a maze-like level filled with various challenges and potential hazards, while possibly collecting points through specific actions. The goal leads to a win condition, whereas the death of the avatar or reaching zero on the sprite counter results in a loss.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar successfully reaches the goal sprite, which contributes to the score.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the avatar encounters hazards (like the lasers or if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Planning Movements**:\n   - Before making any moves, evaluate the layout and the positions of hazards (lasers), boulders, and exit routes.\n   - Use available objects (e.g., boxes and walls) as shields against lasers or to manipulate other sprites (boulders).\n\n2. **Leveraging Sprite Interactions**:\n   - Take advantage of interactions between different sprites to protect yourself from hazards. For example, using boxes as shields when approaching a laser.\n   - Remember that being turned into a boulderm after colliding with one can put the avatar in a dangerous situation; navigate carefully.\n\n3. **Use the Environment**:\n   - Walls can be employed tactically to block lasers or to bounce off of boxes instead of moving directly towards hazards. \n   - Identify paths that minimize risk (i.e., always check destroyable/transforming sprites in the environment).\n\n4. **Score Consideration**:\n   - While reaching the goal is crucial, the scoring mechanic could encourage taking risks for additional points (e.g., purposely activating laser kills).\n   - Balancing between going for points and safely navigating to the goal will be vital.\n\n5. **Adaptability**:\n   - As different interactions can lead to unexpected results (e.g., bouncing forward), players should be prepared to adapt their strategy mid-move based on interactions.\n\nBy focusing on movement strategy, leveraging the environment, and carefully navigating interactions with objects, players should be able to optimize their path to the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\nboulderm -> 'g'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*@.*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbbb..*\n*.@*...@.......*&bbbb..*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*@.*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbbb..*\n*.@*...@.......*&bbbb..*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Next Strategy Step**: Move the avatar left to push the boulder against the wall, effectively blocking hazards while enabling access to the path toward the goal; if the state does not change after this action, be prepared to explore moving down or right for alternative options.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
