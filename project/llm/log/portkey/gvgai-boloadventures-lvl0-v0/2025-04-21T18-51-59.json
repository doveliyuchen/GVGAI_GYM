    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**: \nBased on the given rules and mechanics, this game appears to fall into the puzzle platformer genre. Players navigate through levels, solving spatial problems using various game sprites, interacting with environmental elements, and avoiding or managing hazards.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n1. **Player Avatar**: The player controls an avatar, which can interact with various elements in the game.\n2. **Interactivity**: The game features several interactions, such as pushing boxes, being blocked by walls, attracting gaze or transforming sprites, and damaging from lasers.\n3. **Movement and Orientation**: The avatar can step back from interactions (e.g., with walls, boulders, and certain objects) and can potentially gain shields from adjacent boxes.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe main objective is to reach the goal sprite ('goal') while navigating various hazards (such as boulders and lasers) and utilizing the environment (walls, holes, and boxes) to progress. Reaching the goal will yield points and is essential for winning the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which also gives a score change of +5 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if there are no remaining avatars (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' reaches zero).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the current level layout. The map contains walls, holes, and obstacles that require careful navigation.\n   \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Boxes can serve as shields against lasers. Always position boxes to absorb lasers when approaching them, and use the interaction of bouncing forward to navigate obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be mindful of the boulders and laser sprites:\n   - Do not approach the laser from the front, as it leads to immediate elimination.\n   - Avoid falling into holes when interacting with boulders, as it leads to a loss of life and advancement blockage.\n\n4. **Transforming Sprites**: Interactions can change the types of sprites:\n   - Use the boulders skillfully to either attract gaze or transform them. If you\u2019re in a difficult situation, try to use transformation mechanics to your advantage. \n\n5. **Leveraging Short Distances**: Utilize the stepping back mechanic to create space between you and threats, particularly when approaching walls or boulders.\n\n6. **Plan Your Route**: Before making any movement, outline your route toward the goal. Identify potential hazards and safe zones to exploit boxes and space for navigation.\n\n7. **Incremental Progress**: In scenarios involving multiple laser cannons or boulders, break down your movements into small increments to assess every possible interaction without jumping into danger.\n\nThrough strategic movement, constant awareness of environment interactions, and calculated risk-taking, players can navigate to the goal effectively while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.
