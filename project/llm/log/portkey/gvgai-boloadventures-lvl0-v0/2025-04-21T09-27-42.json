Players are required to navigate through a level filled with obstacles, interact with various game elements, and achieve an objective that involves reaching a specific location (the goal) while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** Various sprites (game objects) are defined including 'ground', 'walls', 'holes', 'goals', 'boxes', 'boulders', and 'lasercannons', each with different properties and functions. The avatar interacts with these sprites to achieve game objectives.\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, and boulders. It can be pushed back or transformed based on its interactions.\n- **Lasers and Projectiles:** The presence of lasers adds an element of danger. Lasers can kill the avatar on frontal contact, indicating timing and positioning are crucial.\n- **Goal Mechanism:** The goal acts as a target zone and rewards the player with points upon reaching it.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the 'goal' sprite located at the end of the level. When the avatar reaches the goal, the game registers a win and awards 5 points.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the avatar reaches the 'goal' (score change of +5).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is killed, which can happen in several ways:\n  - Being hit by a laser.\n  - Falling into a hole.\n  - The avatar being transformed into a boulderm.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement Planning:** The player should map out the movement and potential hazards before acting, considering the interactions available. Knowing how different sprites behave when interacted with will be crucial.\n2. **Avoid Lasers:** The player should ensure the avatar is never in the path of a laser. If lasers are being fired from multiple directions, determining a safe path will require strategic timing.\n3. **Utilize Boxes and Boulder Mechanics:** Use boxes to shield the avatar from lasers when necessary and interact with them to move boulders if required for opening paths. Leveraging the boulders to create barriers or allow movement towards the goal is key.\n4. **Exit Strategy:** The player must always have an escape route or backup plan (like bouncing off boxes) to avoid being transformed into a boulderm or falling into a hole.\n5. **Interactions are Key:** Understanding how various sprites interact with the avatar can be a game-changer. Using boxes to prevent laser damage or manipulating the position of other sprites with boulders would help navigate to the goal effectively.\n6. **Conserve Movement Space:** Since the map is somewhat confined by walls, careful planning of movement to avoid being pushed back or hindered by other sprites is essential. Avoid unnecessary movements that could push the avatar into danger.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires a blend of puzzle-solving skills, careful navigation, and strategic interaction with game elements. By focusing on avoiding hazards and effectively using the available sprites, players can successfully reach the goal and win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Players are required to navigate through a level filled with obstacles, interact with various game elements, and achieve an objective that involves reaching a specific location (the goal) while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** Various sprites (game objects) are defined including 'ground', 'walls', 'holes', 'goals', 'boxes', 'boulders', and 'lasercannons', each with different properties and functions. The avatar interacts with these sprites to achieve game objectives.\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, and boulders. It can be pushed back or transformed based on its interactions.\n- **Lasers and Projectiles:** The presence of lasers adds an element of danger. Lasers can kill the avatar on frontal contact, indicating timing and positioning are crucial.\n- **Goal Mechanism:** The goal acts as a target zone and rewards the player with points upon reaching it.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the 'goal' sprite located at the end of the level. When the avatar reaches the goal, the game registers a win and awards 5 points.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the avatar reaches the 'goal' (score change of +5).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is killed, which can happen in several ways:\n  - Being hit by a laser.\n  - Falling into a hole.\n  - The avatar being transformed into a boulderm.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement Planning:** The player should map out the movement and potential hazards before acting, considering the interactions available. Knowing how different sprites behave when interacted with will be crucial.\n2. **Avoid Lasers:** The player should ensure the avatar is never in the path of a laser. If lasers are being fired from multiple directions, determining a safe path will require strategic timing.\n3. **Utilize Boxes and Boulder Mechanics:** Use boxes to shield the avatar from lasers when necessary and interact with them to move boulders if required for opening paths. Leveraging the boulders to create barriers or allow movement towards the goal is key.\n4. **Exit Strategy:** The player must always have an escape route or backup plan (like bouncing off boxes) to avoid being transformed into a boulderm or falling into a hole.\n5. **Interactions are Key:** Understanding how various sprites interact with the avatar can be a game-changer. Using boxes to prevent laser damage or manipulating the position of other sprites with boulders would help navigate to the goal effectively.\n6. **Conserve Movement Space:** Since the map is somewhat confined by walls, careful planning of movement to avoid being pushed back or hindered by other sprites is essential. Avoid unnecessary movements that could push the avatar into danger.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires a blend of puzzle-solving skills, careful navigation, and strategic interaction with game elements.
