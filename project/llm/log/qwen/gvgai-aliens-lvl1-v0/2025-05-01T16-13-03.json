The bombs are already descending, and they pose a threat to the base.\n\nGiven the current state, the priority is to use the missile (ACTION_USE) to destroy the bombs before they hit the base or the avatar. After firing, the avatar should reposition itself to avoid being caught in the line of fire from any additional bombs.\n\n``` \nAction:1\n```\nFeedback: Firing a missile should intercept the bombs and protect the base. If successful, I expect the bombs to be destroyed, and the score might increase. Next, I will consider moving the avatar to a safer position if necessary."

My expectation is that this action will align with the strategy of prioritizing base defense by allowing me to intercept alien bombs before they reach the base. If the avatar doesn't move, I'll try the same action again to ensure rotation has been completed."
