I expect the avatar to now be adjacent to or on top of the key in the next state. If the position does not change, it may indicate a rotation occurred, and the same action will need to be repeated to move."

  {
    "role": "response",
    "content": "``` \nAction:2\n```\n\nFeedback: Moving left (Action:2) will position the avatar closer to the key, which aligns with the strategy of prioritizing key collection. I expect the avatar to move one step closer to the key, reducing the distance and enabling progress toward the goal."

  {
    "role": "response",
    "content": "``` \nAction:2\n```\n\nFeedback: The action chosen is to move left (ACTION_LEFT) in order to progress toward the key, which is located closer to the avatar's starting position. This aligns with the strategy of collecting the key as the immediate priority to enable progression. If the avatar does not move, it may indicate a rotation has occurred, and the same action should be attempted again to ensure movement."
