The `monsterQuick` (`%`) is farther away but faster, so we need to be cautious when approaching the key.\n\nGiven the current position and layout, the best action is to move south (`ACTION_DOWN`), as this brings the avatar closer to the key while avoiding immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n### Expected Outcome\n\nBy moving south, the avatar will progress toward the key without engaging any enemies.

Based on the layout:\n- Moving **up** (`ACTION_UP`) will bring the avatar closer to potential key locations without directly encountering enemies.\n\n``` \nAction:5\n```\n\n#### Feedback:\nMoving up should help the avatar explore a new area while staying safe from nearby enemies. I expect this action to bring the avatar closer to the key or provide better visibility for strategic movement."

These enemies will move toward the avatar based on their cooldowns.\n- The key is likely nearby, as the player cannot progress without collecting it first.\n- To avoid immediate danger, the avatar should move away from the enemies while searching for the key.\n\n### Action Selection\n- Moving **up** (`ACTION_UP`) will take the avatar closer to potential key locations and away from the immediate threat posed by the `monsterNormal` and `monsterSlow`.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nBy moving up, the avatar avoids the advancing enemies and may uncover the key or a safer path to explore.\n\n``` \nAction:5 \n```\n\nFeedback: Moving up aligns with the strategy to evade threats and search for the key, which is essential for progressing toward the goal."
