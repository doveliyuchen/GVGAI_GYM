If the avatar is near the key, move toward the key.\n2. After collecting the key, move toward the goal while avoiding enemies.\n\n### Decision:\nAssuming the avatar is at `(5, 7)`:\n- Move right (`ACTION_RIGHT`) to reach the key at `(5, 9)`.\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\n\n**Feedback**: Moving right should bring the avatar closer to the key.

However, based on the rules, it should be at position `(5,6)` as indicated by `*`.\n2. **Key Position**: The key (`#`) is located at `(5,9)`.\n3. **Goal Position**: The goal (`g`) is combined with a slow monster (`k`) at `(1,4)`.\n4. **Enemies**:\n   - A quick monster (`%`) is at `(1,3)`.\n   - A normal monster (`$`) is at `(7,5)`.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Move toward the key (`#`) at `(5,9)`.\n2. Avoid or eliminate enemies along the way.\n3. Once the key is collected, move toward the goal (`g`) at `(1,4)` while avoiding or eliminating any remaining enemies.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- The avatar is currently at `(5,6)`. To reach the key at `(5,9)`, we need to move right three times.\n- Since there are no immediate enemies in the path to the key, moving right is safe.\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\n\n**Feedback**: Moving right will bring the avatar closer to the key. After collecting the key, the next step will be to navigate toward the goal while dealing with any enemies in the way."
