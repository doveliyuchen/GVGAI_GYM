To reach the key at (5, 9), it must move upward and to the right. However, there are walls and monsters in the vicinity:\n\n1. Moving up will bring the avatar closer to the quick monster (`&`) at (1, 2). If possible, avoid direct confrontation unless necessary.\n2.

Avoid or defeat enemies along the way.\n3. Once the key is collected, proceed to the goal (`@`).\n\n#### **Next Step**\nFrom the avatar's current position (6, 3), the next logical move is to move **right** to (6, 4) to progress toward the key.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\n\n#### Feedback:\nMoving right will bring the avatar closer to the key while avoiding immediate enemy threats.

Currently, the avatar is located at `(5,7)` (row 5, column 7).\n- **Key Position**: The key (`+`, mapped to `#`) is located at `(5,9)`.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal (`g`, mapped to `@`) is located at `(1,4)`.\n- **Monster Positions**:\n  - Quick monster (`1`, mapped to `%`) is at `(3,4)`.\n  - Normal-speed monster (`2`, mapped to `$`) is at `(1,7)`.\n  - Slow monster (`3`, mapped to `&`) is at `(1,3)`.\n\n### Strategy Application\n\n1. **Objective**: Collect the key (`#`) at `(5,9)` before heading towards the goal (`@`) at `(1,4)`.\n2. **Threats**: Be cautious of monsters. The normal-speed monster (`$`) at `(1,7)` is close to the goal, so avoid triggering its movement until after collecting the key.\n3. **Path Planning**: Move right to collect the key, then navigate up towards the goal while avoiding monsters.\n\n### Action Decision\n\nCurrently, the avatar is at `(5,7)` and needs to move right to collect the key at `(5,9)`.\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\n\n**Feedback**: Moving right should align the avatar with the key's column, preparing for collection in the next step. If the avatar doesn't move, reapply the action to ensure rotation has been accounted for."

For now, focus on reaching the key.\n\n### Action Selection\nGiven the current state and strategy:\n- The avatar needs to move right to reach the key.\n- If the avatar's position does not change after attempting to move right, it may indicate that the avatar is rotating instead of moving.
