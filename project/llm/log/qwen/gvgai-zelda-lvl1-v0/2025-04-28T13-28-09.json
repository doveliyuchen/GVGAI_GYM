To reach the key at `(5, 10)`, the avatar needs to move right and then down.\n- The `monsterQuick` (`%`) is nearby at `(1, 9)`.

It is located at `(1, 8)` in the original state (or `(8, 1)` in the rotated state).\n\n#### **Rules Recap**:\n1. The avatar (`*`) can collect the key (`#`) to transform into `withkey` and then reach the goal (`@`) to win.\n2. Collecting the key gives a score increase of +1.\n3. Using the sword (`ACTION_USE`) can kill enemies, giving a score increase of +2 per enemy killed.\n4. Contact between the avatar and an enemy results in the avatar's death (`win=False`), with a score decrease of -1.\n5. The game ends when the avatar reaches the goal or when the avatar dies.\n\n#### **Strategy**:\n1. First priority: Collect the key (`#`) to become `withkey`.\n2. Second priority: Avoid enemies while navigating to the goal (`@`).\n3. If necessary, use the sword (`ACTION_USE`) to eliminate enemies blocking the path.\n4. Ensure the avatar avoids walls (`w`) and does not step back unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n### Action Decision:\n\n#### Current Position:\n- Avatar: `(7, 6)` in the original state (or `(6, 7)` in the rotated state).\n- Key: `(9, 10)` in the original state (or `(10, 9)` in the rotated state).\n\n#### Path Planning:\n1. To reach the key, the avatar needs to move right and down.\n2. No immediate enemies are directly in the path to the key, but there is a wall blocking the direct route. The avatar must navigate around the wall carefully.\n3. Once the key is collected, the avatar can proceed to the goal.\n\n#### Action Selection:\n- **Move Right**: The avatar should move to the right to start approaching the key.\n\n---\n\n### Final Response:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\n**Feedback**: Moving right will bring the avatar closer to the key, which is essential for transforming into `withkey` and enabling access to the goal. I expect the avatar to successfully move one step closer to the key without encountering any obstacles."

    "content": "### Analysis of the State:\n\n- **Avatar Position:** The avatar (`a`) is not visible in the current state. Based on the mapping, it seems to be represented by `A` (nokey) or `*` (nokey). From the rotated state, it appears to be at position `(8, 7)` (`w...w.......w` has an `*`).\n  \n- **Goal Position:** The goal (`@`) is located at `(4, 1)` in the original state or `(1, 4)` in the rotated state.\n\n- **Key Position:** The key (`#`) is located at `(9, 5)` in the original state or `(5, 9)` in the rotated state.\n\n- **Enemies:**\n  - A `monsterQuick` (`%`) is at `(6, 1)` in the original state or `(1, 6)` in the rotated state.\n  - A `monsterSlow` (`&`) is at `(3, 1)` in the original state or `(1, 3)` in the rotated state.\n  - A `monsterNormal` (`$`) is at `(9, 8)` in the original state or `(8, 9)` in the rotated state.\n\n- **Walls:** Walls (`w`) block movement and are present around the edges and internally.\n\n---\n\n### Rule Interpretation:\n\n1. **Objective:** Collect the key (`#`), reach the goal (`@`), and avoid/enemy enemies (`%`, `$`, `&`).\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - If the avatar (`A` or `*`) touches a wall, it will step back.\n   - If the avatar (`A`) collects the key (`#`), it transforms into `withkey` (`*` becomes orange).\n   - If the avatar (`*`) reaches the goal (`@`) with the key, it scores +1 and wins.\n   - If the avatar (`A` or `*`) is touched by an enemy, it loses 1 point and dies.\n   - The avatar can shoot a sword (`sword`) to kill enemies, scoring +2 per kill.\n3. **Termination:**\n   - Win if the goal (`@`) is reached with the key (`*`).\n   - Lose if the avatar (`A` or `*`) is destroyed.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Priority 1:** Avoid enemies (`%`, `$`, `&`) and walls (`w`).\n2. **Priority 2:** Collect the key (`#`) to transform into `withkey` (`*`).\n3. **Priority 3:** Move toward the goal (`@`) while avoiding enemies.\n\n---\n\n### Action Plan:\n\n- The avatar (`*`) is currently at `(8, 7)` in the rotated state.\n- The key (`#`) is at `(5, 9)`. To reach it, move **up** and **right**.\n- Avoid the `monsterSlow` (`&`) at `(1, 3)` and the `monsterQuick` (`%`) at `(1, 6)`.\n\n#### Current Decision:\nMove **up** (`ACTION_UP`) to get closer to the key.\n\n---\n\n### Response:\n\n``` \nAction:5 \n```\n\n**Feedback:** Moving up should bring the avatar closer to the key. If successful, the next step will involve moving right to collect the key."

    "content": "Based on the game rules and current state, here's the interpretation:\n\n- Your avatar ('a') is not visible in the current state, which means it might be at a position not shown or needs to be located.\n- The key ('#') is located at (7, 9) in the original state.\n- The goal ('@') is located at (4, 1) in the original state.\n- There are three types of monsters: quick ('%') at (5, 1), normal ('$') at (8, 9), and slow ('&') at (3, 1).\n- Walls ('w') block movement.\n\nSince the avatar is not visible, we assume it starts at a position like 'A' (nokey). Given the layout, we need to find the avatar and move towards the key first, then towards the goal.\n\nLet's assume the avatar starts near the key. We should move right to pick up the key.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nFeedback: Moving right should help the avatar pick up the key, transforming it into 'withkey' status, allowing it to eventually reach the goal."

    "content": "Based on the rules and current state, here's the analysis:\n\n1. The avatar (A or *) is located at (8,7) in the original state.\n2. The goal (g or @) is at (4,1).\n3. The key (#) is at (6,9).\n4. There are three types of monsters: Quick (&), Normal ($), and Slow (%).\n5. The strategy should be to first get the key and then move towards the goal.\n\nCurrently, the key is down-right from the avatar, and there's a slow monster (%) between them. Since the last action isn't provided, let's assume moving right would be a good start to approach the key while avoiding the monsters.\n\nAction:3\nFeedback: Moving right will bring the avatar closer to the key, which is necessary to unlock the goal. Expect to see the avatar position change to (8,8) in the next state."

The goal ('@') is located near a monsterQuick ('%'), and there is a key ('#') on the map. To win the game, the avatar needs to collect the key, become 'withkey', and then reach the goal.\n\nSince the avatar's position is unknown, we can start by taking an exploratory action. Moving up might help locate the avatar or move towards potential useful items.\n\nAction:5  \n\nFeedback: By moving up, I expect to either reveal the avatar's position or progress towards finding the key or avoiding enemies. If the avatar remains unlocated, further exploration will be necessary."
