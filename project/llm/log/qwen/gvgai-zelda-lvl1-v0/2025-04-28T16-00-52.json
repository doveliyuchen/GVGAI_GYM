    "content": "The goal of the game is to collect the key (`#`), reach the door (`@`), and exit while avoiding or defeating enemies (`%`, `$`, `&`). The avatar starts as `*` (nokey) and can transform into `a` (withkey) after collecting the key. You can shoot a sword (`ACTION_USE`) to defeat enemies, earning 2 points per enemy killed. Reaching the door with the key grants 1 point, and touching the door without the key results in failure.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Locate the avatar**: The avatar is currently at `(7,1)` in the original state.\n2. **Find the key**: The key is located at `(5,9)`.\n3. **Avoid enemies**: There are three types of enemies: quick (`%` at `(1,10)`), normal (`$` at `(3,11)`), and slow (`&` at `(1,2)`).\n4. **Plan the path**: Move toward the key while avoiding or shooting enemies. Once the key is collected, move toward the door (`@` at `(1,4)`).\n\n### Current Action:\nThe avatar is at `(7,1)` and needs to move upward to reach the key. The first step should be moving up.\n\n``` \nAction:5\n```\n\nFeedback: Moving up will bring the avatar closer to the key. I expect the avatar to now be at position `(6,1)` in the next state."

There's also a slow monster (`$`) at (3, 11). Walls block certain paths.\n\nTo win, we need to:\n1. Pick up the key.\n2. Avoid or eliminate enemies.\n3. Reach the goal.\n\nCurrently, the avatar needs to move towards the key first.\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\nFeedback: Moving right should bring the avatar closer to the key, which is essential for unlocking the goal."
