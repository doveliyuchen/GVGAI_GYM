Therefore, the immediate objective is to move toward the key.\n\n### Path to Key:\nFrom the avatar's current position (1, 11), the key is located at (4, 1). To reach the key, the avatar needs to move left and down. However, there are walls blocking direct paths, so we need to navigate around them.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move left to avoid the wall and approach the key.\n2. Once the key is collected, proceed toward the goal while avoiding or defeating monsters.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n```Action:2```\n\n#### Feedback:\nMoving left will bring the avatar closer to the key while avoiding the quick monster (`%`) currently positioned at (4, 11). This aligns with the strategy of prioritizing key collection for progression."
