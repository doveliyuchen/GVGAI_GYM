Expect to make progress toward securing the key while keeping the monsterQuick ('%') to our right side for optimal positioning.\n\n**Rationale**: \n1. The key is located at (4,1) while our avatar ('*') is at (2,10) - we need to move rightward through the open corridor\n2. The monsterQuick ('%') at (4,10) is currently positioned such that rightward movement keeps it on our right side (optimal for sword defense if needed)\n3. Following the \"Key Acquisition Sprint\" plan, we prioritize continuous right movement until obtaining the key\n4. The path appears clear for initial rightward movement with walls channeling our direction\n\nIf position doesn't change next turn, will re-apply right movement after confirming rotation."
