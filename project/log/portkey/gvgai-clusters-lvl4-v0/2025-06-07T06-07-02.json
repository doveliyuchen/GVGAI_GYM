    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a level, interacting with different block types, and solving challenges to achieve goals.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - Different types of immovable and movable objects including walls, blocks, boxes, and holes.\n   - The avatar can interact with these sprites to create effects such as bouncing, transforming blocks, or losing lives.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with various blocks to cause transformations (e.g., changing blueboxes into blueblocks) or to impel movement (e.g., bouncing off boxes).\n   - The presence of \u201choles\u201d acts as a hazard that decreases the player\u2019s score and can lead to a game loss if the avatar's count reaches zero.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to change all the **boxes** into their corresponding **broken boxes** and ensure no **boxes** remain by the end. Players must avoid failing conditions (like running out of avatars or time) to win and make the correct transformations.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**:\n  - All boxes must be transformed into broken boxes (Counter for boxes reaching zero).\n- **Loss**:\n  - The avatar count reaches zero (SpriteCounter for avatar).\n  - A timeout occurs (1500 steps without achieving the goal).\n  - A brokenBox sprite exists at the end (MultiSpriteCounter for brokenBox).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Efficient Movement**:\n   - Carefully plan routes to minimize interactions that might cause the avatar to bounce back into hazards or walls. \n\n2. **Block Management**:\n   - Use blue, red, and green boxes strategically to turn them into their respective blocks. For example, if you need to convert boxes, ensure you\u2019re placing the right box next to the right block type.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Be mindful of locations with holes and walls to prevent the avatar from being trapped or losing lives.\n\n4. **Sequential Play**:\n   - Focus on transforming boxes one at a time to prevent undoing work already completed with previous transformations. \n\n5. **Deadline Awareness**:\n   - Engage with the level quickly and effectively within the 1500 move limit, planning moves ahead to maximize the use of available blocks and boxes.\n\nBy implementing the strategies above, players can navigate challenges posed by the game's mechanics and reach the objective of transforming all boxes successfully while managing potential risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

The nearby tiles include movable blueboxes ('#'), holes ('&'), redblocks ('*'), and greenboxes ('%'). \n\nThe strategic aim is to transform all boxes into broken boxes while avoiding falling into holes or being trapped by walls. \n\nNext, I should check if there's a bluebox that I can interact with to transform it. There is a bluebox at (2, 7) that can be directly accessed. Formulating a plan, I can start moving towards it.

I expect the avatar to move to (6, 6).",
