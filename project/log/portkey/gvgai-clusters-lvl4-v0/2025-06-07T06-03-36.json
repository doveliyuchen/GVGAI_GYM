    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle/platformer. Players navigate through a grid-like environment interacting with various sprites (objects) to achieve specific objectives while avoiding obstacles and managing limited resources.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features various immovable objects (walls, floors, blocks) and interactive elements (boxes, holes).\n- **Movement & Interactions**: The player character (the \"avatar\") can move through the environment and interact with other sprites. Specifically:\n  - Moving into a wall causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Falling into a hole results in a penalty (losing points).\n  - Specific types of boxes can bounce the avatar forward or transform into different types of blocks, which can then yield points.\n- **Transformation**: The sprites can change their types (e.g., bluebox to blueblock), and certain interactions can lead to the undoing of previous actions.\n  \n#### Objective\nThe player's primary goal is to clear the level by transforming as many boxes as necessary while ensuring that no avatar exists to meet the termination conditions. The game ends successfully when all boxes have been handled (i.e., transformed or used) and no avatar remains.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - All boxes are handled (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatars reaches 0).\n  - A broken box exists in the environment (MultiSpriteCounter for brokenBox reaches 1).\n  - A time limit is reached (1500 units of time).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before acting, analyze the layout and plan how to interact with boxes and blocks to ensure no avatar steps into walls or holes unnecessarily. Avoid running out of avatars.\n   \n2. **Utilize Bouncing**: Use the \"box\" interactions to bounce the avatar and strategically position it. Each bounce can help advance your goals by moving the avatar closer to potential transformation spots or necessary blocks.\n\n3. **Collect and Transform**: Focus on collecting the boxes (blue, red, and green) and transforming them into blocks for points. Aim for efficient use of each type box to maximize your score during transformations.\n\n4. **Manage Resources**: Be mindful of the limited number of avatars. Losing an avatar by falling into a hole is detrimental, thus call for caution when navigating especially near holes or walls.\n\n5. **Undoing Moves**: Utilize the undo features with caution\u2014if certain combinations can potentially cause backtracking, ensure you're in a position where undoing benefits your current state.\n\n6. **Timing**: Be aware of time as a factor. Ensure your strategy does not lead to delays that can be exploited by opponents or environmental obstacles.\n\nOverall, patience and attention to the mechanics of each sprite will lead to successful progression through the puzzle. Each level may require different strategies based on layout and available interactions, so adaptability is key.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> %\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
