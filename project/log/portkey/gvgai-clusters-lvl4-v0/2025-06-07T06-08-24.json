    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle/platformer**. Players navigate through a grid layout, interacting with various objects to achieve specific goals, likely requiring both strategic thinking and spatial awareness.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game features several types of sprites including:\n   - **Immovable Objects:** `floor`, `wall`, `block`\n   - **Transformable Objects:** `bluebox`, `redbox`, `greenbox` that can transform into their respective blocks.\n   - **Interactive Objects:** `hole`, which is deadly; and `box`, which can bounce the avatar.\n\n2. **Interactions:** The gameplay mechanics are based on interactions between the avatar (the player's character) and various blocks and boxes:\n   - The avatar moves freely but cannot pass through walls and gets pushed back if it collides with one.\n   - Encountering a `hole` results in losing a life or point.\n   - The `box` can bounce the avatar forward, while boxes of the same color transform into blocks, scoring points.\n\n3. **Scoring:** Players earn points by successfully transforming boxes into blocks and lose points when they hit a hole.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to **eliminate all the boxes** from the level while avoiding loss conditions. Specifically, you need to reach a state where there are no active boxes left (indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0`). \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - The player wins when all boxes have been transformed (i.e., `box` count reaches zero).\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:** \n  - If the player loses all lives (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0`), they failed.\n  - If a `brokenBox` appears, it results in a loss condition (unless addressed).\n  - If the timer runs out (`Timeout limit=1500`), the game ends in failure.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Movements:** Before moving the avatar, analyze the grid and potential interactions. Avoid immediate death by not moving into `holes` and being aware of walls.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:** Use the boxes to gain points or to get to strategic locations. Move them cleverly to transform them into blocks without hitting walls.\n\n3. **Strategic Box Transformations:** Prioritize transforming boxes in a sequence that won\u2019t create a `brokenBox`, ensuring to plan around the interdependencies of color boxes and blocks.\n\n4. **Safe Navigation:** Always consider where the avatar is going next. Avoid areas where you risk running into a `hole` or getting stuck due to transformation interactions.\n\n5. **Timing:** Keep an eye on the timer. Move efficiently to finish transforming boxes before reaching the timeout limit.\n\nThis combination of puzzle-solving, risk management, and strategic movement should provide a solid approach to successfully completing each level in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Based on the current state, your avatar is located at (row=7, col=6). You are surrounded by several objects, including a greenbox at (row=5, col=3) below and (row=5, col=5) to the right. Additionally, you need to avoid the holes at (row=3, col=3) and (row=3, col=9). The primary goal is to eliminate all boxes from the level by transforming them into blocks.\n\nTo strategize effectively, I suggest the following action:\n\n### Action: Move Up \nMoving up (ACTION_UP) changes your position to (row=6, col=6) where there is another hole. However, this could allow you to proceed to a different location afterward, like moving left or down depending on the future possibilities.\n\nSo, I will choose the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nI expect that moving up might allow new options in subsequent turns, helping eliminate boxes while avoiding immediate threats.",
