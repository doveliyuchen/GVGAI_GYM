    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle platformer** due to the use of movable objects (sprites), interactions between them, and a focus on spatial reasoning to achieve objectives within a limited number of moves or time.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various types of sprites such as walls, holes, blocks, and boxes, which interact with the player's avatar.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, bouncing back when hitting them.\n   - Hitting a hole results in the loss of life (score decreases).\n   - Interacting with boxes can launch the avatar forward.\n   - Different colors of boxes and blocks can transform into each other based on specific interactions, often resulting in score changes.\n   - The environment features immovable objects and a limited number of moves determined by the \"SpriteCounter\" mechanics.\n   \n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes (sprites of type \"box\") within the level. This is achieved while avoiding holes and managing the transformation and interaction of blocks and boxes strategically.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully remove all boxes from the level.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n   - The avatar count reaches zero (lost all lives).\n   - One of the broken boxes appears on the screen (specific failure condition).\n   - The player runs out of time (limit reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Given that some interactions cause removal or transformation of sprites, think ahead about how to utilize the boxes and their interactions effectively. \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Refrain from moving into holes to prevent losing lives. Assess the environment for safer paths to navigate.\n3. **Use the Environment**: Utilize walls to bounce off strategically and prevent getting stuck or lowering your sprite count inadvertently.\n4. **Transform Wisely**: Make use of the block and box interactions by pairing them with their same color types to achieve the desired outcomes without hitting into things that would cause a setback.\n5. **Prioritize Box Destruction**: Focus efforts on interacting with boxes to convert them efficiently and stay aware of your remaining chances based on the avatar and box counts displayed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy approaching the game with a cautious strategy, planning each move, leveraging interactions wisely, and carefully managing the avatar\u2019s health and time, players can successfully navigate the level and achieve the goal of removing all boxes while aiming to not lose lives or time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the state of the game, your avatar ('a') is currently positioned at (6, 5), and it is surrounded by various elements including walls, boxes, and hazards (holes and blocks). \n\nAnalyzing the immediate surroundings, it looks like the avatar has a blue box ('#') directly to the right at (6, 4) and a hole ('&') at (6, 6) which poses a danger. The walls are located at (0, x) and (9, x), meaning no movement is possible upward or downward.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the avatar's position has not changed, we should consider the action leading to another rotation or potential movement this turn based on the provided actions. We want to manipulate the blue box first since eliminating boxes is the primary objective. \n\n1. Attempt **ACTION_LEFT (2)** to see if it allows access to the blue box directly:\n- If the action results in rotation without collision, the avatar must act again to proceed. \n\nGiven that the avatar is currently at (6, 5), moving left to (6, 4) is safe as it leads to the blue box, and it maintains a safe distance from the hole at (6, 6).\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left towards the blue box puts us in position to potentially eliminate a box in subsequent turns while avoiding hazards, which aligns with the strategy established.",
