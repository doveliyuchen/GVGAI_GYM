    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, descriptions, and interactions, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle platformer**. Players navigate a 2D grid-based environment, interacting with various sprite types to solve puzzles involving movement and transformation.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: There are various immovable and mutable sprites (blocks, boxes, walls, holes) that interact with the player's avatar in unique ways.\n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move around the tiles. The avatar can interact with boxes and blocks to perform actions such as bouncing, transforming, stepping back, or being killed.\n- **Box Interactions**: Boxes can be transformed into blocks of different colors or into broken boxes when interacting with holes.\n- **Wall Interaction**: The avatar cannot pass through walls, causing it to step back if it attempts to do so.\n- **Scoring**: The game includes a scoring system where transforming boxes into blocks yields points.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The main goal is to manipulate the boxes in such a way that all boxes are transformed into broken boxes (i.e., removed from the play area).\n- The player must avoid conditions that lead to a loss, such as running out of avatars.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having no remaining boxes on the board.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - Running out of available avatars (if they are killed by falling into holes).\n  - The presence of at least one broken box at the end of the game.\n  - Timing out, where the game ends after 1500 moves/ticks if not completed.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since interactions lead to specific outcomes, plan your moves carefully. Try to work backwards from the win condition to determine how to position boxes effectively.\n  \n2. **Use Bouncing Mechanic Wisely**: The bounce forward from boxes can help reposition other sprites. Consider using the boxes to push other boxes into favorable positions.\n  \n3. **Watch Out for Holes**: Be cautious when moving near holes. Losing avatars can significantly hinder your progress.\n\n4. **Color Transformations**: Take advantage of the color-based interactions carefully. If you have multiple boxes of the same color close to each other, think ahead about how you can transform them into their respective blocks efficiently.\n\n5. **Avoid Undo Moves**: Certain interactions lead to undoing previous changes, which can impede progress. Try to minimize these occurrences to maintain your advancements.\n\n6. **Utilize Limited Resources**: Since avatars are limited, ensure each movement counts. Avoid unnecessary moves that lead to losing an avatar or undoing valuable progress.\n\n7. **Experiment and Learn**: If stuck, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of boxes and positions to discover new interactions or solutions.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and focusing on the mechanics provided, players can navigate through the levels more effectively and increase their chances of achieving the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> a\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is positioned at (3, 7) and is adjacent to a red box at (3, 8) and a red block at (3, 6). The goal is to manipulate the boxes, particularly the red box, to transform it into a broken box while avoiding any potential loss conditions.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- The avatar can attempt to interact with the red box (2) next to it.\n- The left of the avatar (3, 6) blocks movement, so action options are limited.\n- The hole at (3, 3) poses a risk if any movement goes wrong or if the avatar falls into it.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\nGiven the current position and to make progress toward removing the box, you should move right to interact with the red box. Since the avatar's position after an initial attempt may not change due to wall interactions or hold movements, you may need to check if the move resolves as intended.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis action is expected to allow you to push the red box at (3, 8) and potentially set it up for interaction into its broken state in subsequent moves.",
