    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, I can deduce the following elements regarding the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle platformer**. The player navigates through a level filled with various sprites (blocks, boxes, and hazards) and must solve puzzles using these elements to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game contains various immovable sprites like floors, walls, holes (that kill the player), and blocks (which affect gameplay through interactions).\n   - Boxes and special blocks (blue, red, green) can interact with the player's avatar in specific ways.\n   - The avatar can move around the level and interact with other sprites to manipulate the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can push blocks but must avoid falling into holes.\n   - Boxes can bounce the avatar and transform into different types of blocks depending on specific interactions. \n   - When identical blocks of certain colors are placed next to each other, they can transform into a single stronger block, and certain combinations can undo all previous actions.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends in victory when all boxes are removed from the level.\n   - The game ends in failure when the avatar is either killed (by falling into holes) or when broken boxes are present on the level despite having a limit of those allowed.\n   - A countdown timer exists, which can lead to loss if time runs out.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The main goal of the game is to remove all boxes from the level.\n- Players need to strategize around the mechanics of block transformation and interactions to successfully clear the level within the time limit without losing the avatar.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Remove all boxes from the level.\n- **Loss Conditions:** \n  - The avatar is killed by falling into a hole.\n  - More than one broken box remains on the field.\n  - Running out of time.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Moves Wisely:** Before making a move, consider how the avatar interacts with other sprites. Use the \"bounce\" mechanic of boxes to reach other areas and interact with more blocks.\n  \n2. **Manage Block Colors:** Focus on grouping same-colored blocks together. If you see opportunities to transform blocks into matching colors via boxes, act on that to clear space and boost your score.\n\n3. **Stay Aware of Hazards:** Avoid holes at all costs. Understand each sprite placement and ensure the avatar is in a safe spot before performing actions.\n\n4. **Utilize Time Effectively:** Keep an eye on the timer. While puzzling through your options, ensure you maintain a balance of exploration and execution to complete the level before time expires.\n\n5. **Undo Mechanic Knowledge:** Understand how to benefit from the undo interactions. Manipulate boxes and blocks in a sequence to undo unnecessary moves and re-strategize when necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, a thoughtful approach to manipulating boxes and blocks, paired with cautious navigation of the level, will aid in successfully clearing all boxes and achieving the game's goals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> #\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar (`a`) is positioned at row 7, column 6. To formulate a strategic move, we should consider the nearby sprites and potential interactions.\n\n- **Adjacent Sprites**: \n  - Directly to the left (row 7, col 5): floor (.)\n  - Directly to the right (row 7, col 7): floor (.)\n  - Directly above (row 6, col 6): hole (&)\n  - Directly below (row 8, col 6): floor (.).\n\nThe only potential hazard is the hole directly above your position. Therefore, moving left or right wouldn't change your position relative to hazards. \n\nTo further assess the situation:\n- Moving **UP** towards the hole would lead to failure.\n- Moving **DOWN** to row 8, column 6 remains safe and keeps us on the floor.\n\nSince the player needs to progress without running into danger, let's execute the **DOWN** action to move safely to the next row.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving down is a safe choice that will position the avatar away from the hole and on the floor, allowing for continued strategy execution without immediate hazards.",
