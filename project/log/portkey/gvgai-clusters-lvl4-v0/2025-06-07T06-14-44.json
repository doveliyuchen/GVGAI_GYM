The mechanics involve managing sprites to achieve certain transformations and winning conditions.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** \n   - The game contains various sprites (e.g., walls, holes, boxes, colored blocks) that interact with the player's avatar in different ways.\n   - Certain sprites are immovable while others can change state or be transformed.\n   \n2. **Interactions:** \n   - The `avatar` can interact with `walls` (causing it to step back), `holes` (which result in a loss), and `boxes` (which bounce the avatar forward).\n   - Transformations occur when specific `box` and `block` color combinations are triggered.\n   - Special conditions lead to the creation of a `brokenBox` when a `box` enters a `hole`.\n\n3. **Scoring:** \n   - Players score points through interactions that transform `boxes` into `blocks`.\n   - The player\u2019s score is impacted negatively by certain losses, such as falling into a `hole`.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal is to **transform and navigate the boxes** to remove them from the level, thereby achieving the condition where the `SpriteCounter` for `box` reaches a limit of zero, which results in a win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- The game ends in a win if all `boxes` are transformed and removed (\u201cSpriteCounter limit=0\u201d).\n- The player loses if the `avatar` is killed (falls into a `hole`), if a `brokenBox` is present when the player is supposed to win (`MultiSpriteCounter limit=1`), or if time runs out (`Timeout limit=1500`).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movements:** \n   - Carefully navigate the environment to avoid `holes` and backtracking against `walls`.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Leverage `boxes` to bounce off other objects and create necessary color combinations. Avoid placing `boxes` near `holes` where they could be transformed into unhelpful `brokenBoxes`.\n   \n3. **Create Transformations:**\n   - Aim to transform `blueboxes`, `redboxes`, and `greenboxes` into their respective blocks to score and clear them efficiently. Analyze tile combinations to maximize transformations and minimize step-backs.\n\n4. **Focus on Constraints:**\n   - Be mindful of diagonal movements and stacking boxes. Understand what combinations can lead to cancellation or stalling in your progress, especially with mixed color sprite interactions.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer to ensure movements are efficient. Avoid unnecessary actions that may waste time or lead to unfavorable outcomes (e.g., falling into a `hole`).\n\nBy following this strategy, players can methodically solve puzzles while keeping loss conditions at bay and ultimately achieving the goal of clearing the boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, the avatar is positioned at (5, 3). The immediate surroundings include:\n\n- To the left (5, 2): empty floor (.)\n- To the right (5, 4): empty floor (.)\n- Above (4, 3): a green box (%)\n- Below (6, 3): a hole (&)\n- There is also a red box (b) at (5, 8) that can be transformed.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n1. **Moving Left (5, 2)**: This is empty and could lead to further movement options.\n2. **Moving Right (5, 4)**: This is also an empty space.\n3. **Moving Up (4, 3)**: This will interact with a green box (%), which could be beneficial if combined or moved.\n4. **Moving Down (6, 3)**: This leads into a hole (&) which would be a loss.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nAccording to the provided strategy, it's crucial to avoid any actions that would move into a hole or cause unnecessary backtracking. The best move would be to navigate towards the green box above to either use it or facilitate a future transformation.\n\nConsidering that my last action didn't move the avatar, I will take the action to move up to interact with the green box.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should bring me closer to transforming boxes and clearing them efficiently.",
