    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game's rules and structure provided, here is an analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall into the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players control an avatar navigating a grid-based environment filled with various interactive and passive objects.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game utilizes various sprites, including walls, blocks, holes, and boxes with different colors that have specific interactions with the player's avatar.\n- **Movements & Interactions**: The avatar can move around and interact with other sprites. The main interactions involve bouncing off boxes, transforming colored boxes into blocks, and stepping back when encountering walls or blocks.\n- **Killing and Score Change**: The avatars can fail by moving into holes, which results in losing points and ultimately can lead to loss conditions if not managed.\n- **Undo Mechanic**: Some interactions cause the game state to revert to a previous state, offering a strategic aspect to gameplay.\n\n### Objectives\n- The main goal in this game is to **remove all boxes** from the level by manipulating them into their respective colored blocks using interactions.\n- Players also need to manage the state of the boxes effectively to avoid having them turn into broken boxes or run out of opportunities.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if there are **no boxes left** in the level.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar is killed by moving into a hole.\n  - The player runs out of avatars (indicated by SpriteCounter for the avatar reaching zero).\n  - A broken box appears (indicated by the presence of the broken box sprite).\n  - The player exceeds the time limit of 1500.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Moves Carefully**: Since interactions can lead to immediate consequences (like stepping back or transforming objects), plan your moves thoughtfully to avoid setbacks.\n  \n2. **Utilize Bouncing Wisely**: When using boxes, pay attention to how they interact with the wall and the other boxes to create effective pathways for transforming boxes into blocks.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Make sure to steer clear of holes as they trigger negative outcomes. Consider the position of the holes when planning your moves and box placements.\n\n4. **Manage the Timer**: Be aware of the time limit. Efficiency is crucial; try to minimize unnecessary movements that could lead to running out of time.\n\n5. **Undo Moves Strategically**: Save major alterations for when you\u2019ve assessed the situation and know that they will benefit your course towards winning.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can navigate the challenging level layout and optimize their interactions to successfully complete the game's objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

Thus:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is strategic as it keeps the avatar safe while maintaining the ability to interact with nearby boxes in subsequent moves. I'm hopeful this aligns with the strategy to navigate safely and eventually transform the boxes.",
