Players control an avatar and must navigate a level filled with obstacles, utilizing various blocks and boxes to achieve a specific objective.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n1. **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that moves around the level, interacting with different blocks and sprites.\n2. **Block Interactions**: Players can interact with various types of blocks (blue, red, green) that can transform into one another or interact with passive boxes to manipulate their state.\n3. **Winning Condition**: The goal is to eliminate all \"boxes\" from the level while avoiding obstacles that can kill the avatar or otherwise negatively affect the score.\n4. **Time Limit**: A timeout is also in effect, meaning players must finish the level within a certain timeframe (1500 units).\n5. **Obstacles**: The holes in the ground are deadly and cause instant failure if the avatar interacts with them. Walls cause the avatar to bounce back, serving as barriers.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes present in the level before the timer runs out. This is done through strategic manipulation of the blocks and boxes available in each level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- Win: All \"boxes\" must be cleared from the level before the timeout, and while avoiding death through interaction with holes.\n- Loss: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar is killed by a hole.\n  - The timer runs out.\n  - A \"brokenBox\" sprite appears in the level (unspecified mechanics).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before executing actions, take your time to plan how to manipulate the boxes and blocks effectively.\n2. **Prioritize Boxes**: Focus on eliminating the boxes first. Since it's a key win condition, avoid interactions that could lead to the creation of a broken box or cause you to lose boxes.\n3. **Manage Time**: Keep an eye on the remaining time. Avoid unnecessary moves that could prolong interaction cycles, and try to streamline actions wherever possible.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of holes and walls, as colliding with them can lead to immediate consequences. Use the blocks purposefully to navigate around them.\n5. **Use Blocks to Your Advantage**: Utilize the transformation mechanics of the different block colors strategically to arrange the blocks into a formation that allows you to clear boxes effectively.\n6. **Experiment with Box Interactions**: Be prepared to explore how different box interactions can undo previous actions when applying a multi-step strategy to clear boxes.\n\nBy employing these strategies and considering the mechanics outlined above, players can work towards efficiently clearing the level while avoiding pitfalls and maximizing their success in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

There is a blue block there that you can use to manipulate boxes later. \n\nHowever, since moving left is the only safe action here without encountering holes or walls, I will execute:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n  \nThis should efficiently start manipulating the blocks while navigating around hazards.
