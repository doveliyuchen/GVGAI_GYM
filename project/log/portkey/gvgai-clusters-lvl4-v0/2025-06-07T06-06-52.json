These sprites come with different properties and interactions.\n2. **Interaction Rules**: The avatar (player character) can move around the grid and interact with other objects:\n   - Stepping against walls and holes can cause setbacks or end the game.\n   - Boxes can be moved and transformed into blocks, affecting scoring.\n   - Blocks can be used to score points, while certain interactions between boxes and blocks can reset or undo actions.\n3. **Movement**: The avatar is able to move and potentially bounce or step back based on interactions with other sprites.\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary goal is to eliminate all boxes from the level (SpriteCounter for boxes reaching a limit of 0 signifies victory).\n- Points can be gained by transforming boxes into blocks.\n- The game can end in a loss if the player runs out of avatars (SpriteCounter for avatar reaching a limit of 0) or if the time runs out (timeout condition).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes must be transformed or removed from the play area.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player avatar is eliminated.\n  - A broken box remains on the screen.\n  - The time limit of 1500 units is reached.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since your avatar can encounter punishments for moving against walls or holes, always consider your next move carefully. Avoid putting your avatar in a position where it could be eliminated.\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: The boxes are key to your victory. Strategically bouncing or transforming boxes into blocks will allow you to score points while also clearing the board.\n3. **Keep Track of Interactions**: Pay close attention to how different boxes and blocks interact, as some combinations can undo your progress. Always be mindful of how many active boxes you have left and the consequences of your actions.\n4. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Be wary of creating scenarios where you can't move forward due to the positioning of walls and holes. Plan routes that maintain movement options.\n5. **Manage Time Efficiently**: Since the game has a time limit, stay aware of how much time you have left and prioritize movements that advance towards your end goal briskly.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics, you can optimize your play and work towards successfully completing the levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
