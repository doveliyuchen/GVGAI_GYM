    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game resembles a puzzle or action-adventure game with mechanics reminiscent of Bomberman. Players navigate a grid-like environment while avoiding enemies and strategically using bombs.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Environment:** \n   - The game features various sprites, including a player (bomberman), enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions), walls, and bombs.\n   - Background is indicated as immovable, while walls and wallBreaks can interact with bombs.\n\n2. **Bombs and Explosions:**\n   - Players use bombs to create explosions that can destroy walls and defeat enemies.\n   - Bombs spawn various types based on interactions with the environment.\n\n3. **Enemies:**\n   - Enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions) have different cooldowns and constraints, likely affecting how often they can attack the player or react to bombs.\n\n4. **Interactions:**\n   - Players can interact with walls (both breakable and unbreakable), and the bombs can cause explosions that affect both players and enemies.\n   - Players must avoid dying from explosions or enemy attacks.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to traverse the level to reach the green goal door while accumulating points by defeating enemies and breaking walls. Players earn the most points by reaching the goal and avoiding being killed by explosions, enemies, or other hazards.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully reach the goal door. This is achieved when the player, represented by the bomberman sprite, contacts the goal.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the number of bomberman sprites reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness:** \n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of the map. Identify where walls are breakable and locate the position of enemy NPCs.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement:** \n   - Use bombs strategically to create openings in walls and eliminate enemies. Consider using a bomb to trigger chain reactions that can clear multiple threats at once.\n\n3. **Avoiding Enemies:**\n   - Be mindful of enemy patterns and cooldowns. It may be wise to avoid confrontation initially and focus on reaching the goal.\n\n4. **Point Scoring:**\n   - Prioritize actions that score points, such as defeating enemies with bombs and breaking walls when necessary.\n\n5. **Safe Zones:**\n   - Use walls as cover to avoid enemy attacks and explosions. Stay aware of the bomb timer to avoid damaging yourself.\n\n6. **Resource Management:**\n   - Monitor the number of bombs you have available and manage their placements. As bombs spawn from the background, ensure you utilize them effectively and watch out for chain reactions.\n\nBy following these strategic guidelines while staying alert to the dynamics of enemy movement and bomb mechanics, you can successfully navigate the level, defeat enemies, and reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_4 -> 'f'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_3 -> 'i'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'j'\nbomb_2 -> 'k'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'l'\nbomb_1 -> 'm'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'n'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'o'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'p'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'q'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> p\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> q\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current game state, my avatar (bomberman) is located at (4, 9). The goal is to reach the green goal door located at (2, 14), while avoiding enemies and utilizing bombs effectively.\n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n- The avatar's position is surrounded by walls ('&') on the left, right, and down, with a spider ('%') directly below at (5, 5). There are also bomb sprites nearby.\n- The wallBreak ('*') at (6, 1) and other locations can be leveraged as a strategic point for using bombs.\n- The target goal door is upwards and slightly to the right from the avatar's current position.\n\n### Strategy Steps:\n1. Moving up towards (3, 9) isn't viable as there's a wall.\n2. Moving left to (4, 8) keeps the avatar in the same row and can be analyzed, but requires further moves.\n3. The safest course of action appears to be using a bomb to potentially open paths, provided there are notable enemy threats.\n\n### Decision:\nI will use a bomb in my current position (4, 9) to create explosions that can clear enemies or walls nearby.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action uses a bomb to potentially create a better path by destroying surrounding walls or eliminating nearby enemies. My expectation is that after the explosion, I can advance further towards the goal door in subsequent moves.",
