Players have the primary responsibility of navigating through a maze-like environment, placing bombs to defeat enemies, and strategically breaking walls to create paths.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Player Character**: The player controls a \"bomberman\" character who can plant bombs.\n- **Bomb Placement**: The most critical mechanic is the ability to place bombs, which will explode over time, dealing damage to all nearby entities.\n- **Interaction with Environment**: The player can interact with walls to create pathways and with enemies to defeat them.\n- **Collectible Power-Ups**: Players can spawn additional bombs of varying strengths from specific locations, enhancing their destructive capabilities.\n- **Enemy Behavior**: Enemies, represented by bats, spiders, and scorpions, move randomly. Interacting with an enemy can result in the player's defeat.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the **goal (green door)** while defeating enemies and potentially clearing the pathway by breaking walls. Players earn points by:\n- Reaching the goal (+10 points).\n- Defeating enemies (+5 points).\n- Destroying walls or walls in the vicinity of bombs (+1 point).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the player character interacts with the goal sprite, which results in a score change confirming success.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the \"bomberman\" sprite counter reaches zero, indicating the player has run out of lives or was defeated by an enemy or an explosion.\n\n### Suggested Strategies\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Learn the layout of the maze to identify paths, bomb-spawn areas, and enemy locations. Understanding the terrain helps in planning bomb placements strategically.\n\n2. **Enemy Management**: Try to eliminate enemies before they can reach you. Utilizing bombs effectively can allow for area-of-effect damage, providing a safe distance from enemies.\n\n3. **Wall Breaking**: Focus on destroying walls to create additional paths and escape routes. This also allows for better positioning against enemies.\n\n4. **Bomb Placement Timing**: Be cautious with bomb placement. Always ensure you have time to escape or reposition yourself before the bomb explodes. Avoid placing bombs near explosive traps unless you intend to use them strategically.\n\n5. **Collect Bombs**: Increase your bomb capacity by collecting additional bomb types. Utilize stronger bombs to clear out tougher enemies or walls more efficiently.\n\n6. **Keep Moving**: Stay mobile to avoid being cornered by enemies. Utilize breaks in wall segments for quick escapes.\n\n7. **Exploit Enemy Patterns**: Observe enemy movement patterns and use them to predict their behavior. This can help in using bombs effectively while minimizing risk.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of victory, effectively clearing levels and scoring high points while navigating challenges posed by the game's mechanics.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nbomb_5 explosionDown -> 'j'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionUp -> 'k'\nexplosionLeft -> 'l'\nexplosionUp -> 'm'\nbomb -> 'n'\nbomb_4 explosionDown -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> i\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> n\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

Specifically, there is a goal represented by a wall break at (row 2, col 14) and some enemies (scorpions represented by '$') at (row 2, col 13) and (row 4, col 18), along with other entities nearby.\n\nTo progress towards the goal while managing enemy threats, I will analyze the situation:\n\n1. I need to avoid moving toward the enemy scorpions to prevent taking damage.\n2. There are bombable walls around, which can be strategically destroyed to help reach the goal.\n3. The enemy at (row 2, col 13) can be handled with bomb placements if I choose to engage.\n\nConsidering this, my immediate action will be to plant a bomb to break the wall located at (row 2, col 14), as this allows me to potentially reach the goal directly afterward, provided I can time my actions to avoid enemies. Since making an action of merely moving hasn't been performed yet, I will plant a bomb.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this action will help clear a path to the goal and potentially defeat an enemy if they are near the explosion.",
