It involves character movement, attacking enemies, and navigating through obstacles to achieve goals.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various sprites that include the player (bomberman), enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions), bombs, walls, and goal doors.\n- **Bombs:** The player uses bombs strategically to eliminate enemies and destroy walls that contain or protect the goal.\n- **Explosions:** Different types of bombs can be deployed, leading to sequential explosions in various directions.\n- **Interactions:** The interactions include:\n  - Bombs can destroy walls or enemies.\n  - The player can be killed by their own explosion or by enemies.\n  - Players earn score points by destroying enemies or reaching the goal door.\n- **Movement and Strategy:** The player's movement is restricted by walls, and they must use bombs wisely to clear paths and defeat enemies.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal is for the player (bomberman) to successfully reach the 'goal' sprite (the green door) while managing and avoiding threats from enemies. Players earn points by defeating enemies and can potentially lose points if they are defeated themselves.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they reach the 'goal' sprite and a sprite counter of the goal reaches zero. \n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the sprite counter of the bomberman reaches zero, indicating that the player has been defeated.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Bomb Placement:** Strategic placement of bombs is crucial. Try to position bombs where they will affect the most targets (enemies and walls) simultaneously without risking self-harm.\n\n2. **Enemy Management:** Analyze the movement patterns of enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions) and try to lure them into bomb blasts. Utilize walls to keep them at bay while planning your bomb deployment.\n\n3. **Exploration and Adaptation:** Take some time to explore the level layout. Knowing the positioning of walls, enemies, and potential bomb spawns will enable you to plan your moves effectively.\n\n4. **Avoid Self-Destruction:** Be mindful of the blast radius of your bombs. Move away from the areas where you have placed bombs and anticipate their blast to avoid being killed.\n\n5. **Use Walls to Your Advantage:** Walls can hinder both your movement and that of enemies. Utilize them to channel enemies into bomb blasts or as shields when necessary.\n\n6. **Resource Management:** Given the limit on sprite counts for bombs, ensure you are maximizing the value of each bomb used, and don\u2019t waste them on walls when there are better targets.\n\nBy employing these strategies with careful consideration and foresight, players can adeptly navigate the challenges, manage threats, and ultimately achieve the goal in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_6 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'e'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'h'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'j'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'k'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'l'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'm'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> %\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> o\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> n\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> %\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
