Different bomb types exist, possibly with increasing power or different effects.\n- **Enemies and NPCs:** Enemies (like bats, spiders, and scorpions) move randomly with specific cooldowns and constraints; they can be defeated by explosions.\n- **Interaction with Environment:** The player can interact with walls, enemy sprites, and bombs resulting in various outcomes (like being pushed back or eliminated).\n- **Goal:** The player must reach a green door ('goal') to win while avoiding being killed by enemies or their own explosions.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- Advance through levels by reaching the 'goal' sprite (green door).\n- Accumulate points by defeating enemies and breaking walls with bombs.\n- Balance offensive (attacking enemies) and defensive (avoiding damage from enemies or bomb explosions) strategies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the 'goal' sprite while managing to survive.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the bomberman is killed (SpriteCounter for bomberman hits zero), indicating the inability to continue.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Notice the positions of walls, enemies, and bomb placements. This will help you plan routes and identify potential traps.\n  \n2. **Bomb Placement:** \n   - Place bombs in areas with multiple enemies or routes to clear them effectively. \n   - Try to avoid bombing yourself; maintain a safe distance from your own bomb explosions.\n\n3. **Enemy Management:** \n   - Control the movement of enemies by placing bombs to force them into specific positions, making it easier to defeat them.\n   - Always be aware of enemy positions and cooldown timings to prevent being caught unaware.\n\n4. **Exploit Walls:** Utilize walls for cover from enemy attacks and use wall-break areas to gain an advantage in mobility and attack options.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route to Goal:** Always have a clear route in mind towards the goal. If the path is obstructed by enemies, clear them with strategic bomb placements first before making your move toward the win condition.\n\n6. **Resource Management:** Keep track of the available bombs and their types, using them strategically to balance between eliminating threats and moving toward the goal.\n\n7. **Exploration:** Don't hesitate to explore the terrain to discover more tactical placements for bombs or find power-ups that may enhance your abilities.\n\nBy combining careful planning and strategic bomb use, players can navigate through levels efficiently, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach the goal to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_7 explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\nexplosionLeft -> 'l'\nexplosionRight -> 'm'\nexplosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_6 -> 'o'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_5 -> 'p'\nbomb_8 -> 'q'\nbomb bomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_4 explosionLeft explosionRight -> 'r'\nbomb_7 -> 't'\nbomb bomb_1 bomb_3 explosionLeft explosionRight -> 'u'\nbomb_6 -> 'v'\nbomb bomb_2 explosionLeft explosionRight -> 'x'\nbomb_5 -> 'y'\nbomb bomb_1 -> 'z'\nbomb_4 -> 'A'\nbomb -> 'B'\nbomb_3 -> 'C'\nbomb_2 -> 'D'\nbomb_1 -> 'E'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'F'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> B\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> q\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> F\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> %\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
