Players can kill these enemies with explosions, adding a strategic layer to the bomb placement.\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The player can destroy walls using bombs, which can open paths to reach the goal.\n  - The player must avoid getting killed by explosions or colliding with enemies.\n  \n#### Objectives\n- **Main Goal**: The primary objective is to reach the \"goal\" door while accumulating points by defeating enemies and breaking walls.\n- **Scoring**: Points can be earned by destroying enemies (5 points each) and by breaking walls (1 point). Reaching the goal yields a significant reward (10 points).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal door.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the `bomberman` sprite is destroyed (SpriteCounter for `bomberman` hits 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Bomb Placement**: Always think a few steps ahead. Place bombs strategically to maximize area coverage and potentially hit multiple enemies with a single explosion.\n  \n2. **Observe Enemy Movements**: Since enemies have a cooldown before they move, watch their patterns. This information can be crucial in avoiding collisions and planning your attacks.\n\n3. **Break Wall Blocks**: Use walls to your advantage. They can be broken to create pathways but be cautious not to place bombs too close to yourself.\n\n4. **Avoid Direct Confrontation**: Try to avoid direct contact with enemies. Instead, use bombs from a distance, setting traps or creating explosion chains.\n\n5. **Clear the Path**: Focus on clearing a route to the goal while defeating enemies along the way to maximize your score.\n\n6. **Timing is Key**: Timing when to detonate bombs is crucial, especially in relation to enemy movements. Always ensure you stay at a safe distance while bombs are set off.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind and adapting to the dynamics of each room or level, players can navigate effectively toward their goal while maximizing their score and reducing risk.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> j\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> %\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, my bomberman (`@`) is located at (row 4, col 9). Surrounding me, there are walls (`&`), enemies (such as spiders `%` and scorpions `$`), and I see some breakable walls (`*`) and a goal door (`#`) at (row 2, col 14).\n\nAs per the strategy provided:\n1. I need to plan my bomb placement and ensure to maximize coverage by placing bombs where they can potentially hit multiple enemies, while avoiding detonation close to myself.\n2. I should also consider the position and movement patterns of nearby enemies. \n3. Currently, I see a `*` (breakable wall) right below me (row 5, col 10) which can be useful to create paths or eliminate enemies if I can set a bomb.\n\nGiven the information and the current position, the most beneficial action seems to be to place a bomb right below me where the breakable wall is located (5, 9). This would potentially allow for the wall to be destroyed, opening up a path.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will choose to use the bomb at my current position.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing a bomb should help clear some obstacles and potentially take out any nearby enemies. I'm hopeful that this aligns with my overall goal of reaching the exit while maximizing my score by clearing the area.",
