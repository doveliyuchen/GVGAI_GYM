Players gain points by reaching the goal and can earn additional points by destroying enemies or breaking walls.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n- **Character Control**: The main character, referred to as the \"bomberman\", interacts with various sprites including walls, bombs, and enemies.\n- **Bombs**: Players can strategically place bombs that can destroy walls and enemies, creating paths or triggering chain reactions. Bombs also cause explosions, which can lead to player death if mishandled.\n- **Enemy Types**: The game features different enemies like bats, spiders, and scorpions which have unique cooldowns and spawn conditions, potentially adding strategy regarding how and when to interact with them.\n- **Explosions**: A unique mechanic allows for a cascading explosion effect, where one explosion can trigger others, thus potentially clearing blocks or defeating multiple enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win**: The player wins when the \"bomberman\" reaches the goal sprite (green door).\n- **Loss**: The game ends in failure if the \"bomberman\" is killed (if their sprite counter drops to zero), which could occur through enemy interactions or bomb explosions.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Environment Understanding**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout to identify enemy placements and wall positions. This will help you plan your moves and bomb placements efficiently.\n\n2. **Use Bombs Strategically**: Place bombs near walls and clusters of enemies to maximize explosion impact. Timing is crucial; detonate bombs in such a way that chain reactions occur to clear numerous obstacles/enemies at once.\n\n3. **Avoid Backtracking**: Be mindful of the bomb placements. Moving away from walls and other explosive elements can prevent accidentally stepping back and getting caught in your own explosions.\n\n4. **Enemy Awareness**: Stay aware of enemy cooldowns to dodge them easily. Move cautiously to avoid confrontation when they are near. Utilize bombs to eliminate enemies, advancing your score safely.\n\n5. **Path Clearing**: Continuously clear the path towards the goal while considering paths that require the least risk, avoiding unnecessary confrontations with enemies when possible.\n\n6. **Chain Explosions**: Use the chain reaction mechanism to your advantage by positioning bombs to create a series of explosions, enabling you to clear multiple obstacles/enemies without being exposed to danger yourself.\n\n7. **Scoring**: Focus on maximizing your score by strategically taking out enemies while moving towards the goal. Remember that both reaching the goal and destroying enemies provide valuable points which contribute to overall success.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can navigate the challenges pop up in the game and work your way towards achieving victory!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> i\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
