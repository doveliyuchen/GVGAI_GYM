The bombs seem to follow a sequential tiering, with bomb levels decreasing in power as they go from bomb_10 to bomb_1.\n3. **Enemy Movement:** Enemies are instantiated as random NPCs with cooldowns, implying they will move or attack after set intervals. They pose a threat to the bomberman, as contact will result in defeat.\n4. **Goals and Scoring:** The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite while managing enemy threats and obstacle layouts. Achieving this will grant victory, as indicated in the termination conditions.\n\n**Objectives:**  \n- Reach the green goal door while avoiding enemy attacks.\n- Maximize score by eliminating enemies and breaking walls with bombs.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The game ends successfully when the bomberman interacts with the 'goal' sprite.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the bomberman is killed (either by enemy contact or his own bombs).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Your Bomb Placement:** Always consider the bomb's explosion range and what it can hit. Utilize higher-tier bombs initially to clear pathways but be careful not to trap yourself.\n\n2. **Monitor Enemy Patterns:** Since enemies have cooldowns, learn their movement patterns to exploit openings. When a clear path appears, make your move to advance toward the goal.\n\n3. **Use Walls-to-Your Advantage:** Employ walls as barriers against enemies. Use destructible walls to create new paths but be cautious\u2014they can collapse and potentially expose you to enemies.\n\n4. **Prioritize Enemy Elimination:** If enemies are blocking your path to the goal, consider taking them out. Use bombs strategically to eliminate them safely.\n\n5. **Mind the Timer:** Be aware of time strategy involving bomb cooldowns when dealing with enemies. Should you find yourself in danger, act quickly but cautiously.\n\n6. **Chain Reactions:** Set up bombs such that their explosions cause chain reactions, breaking multiple walls and potentially destroying enemies at once.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively navigate the level, handle enemy threats, and ultimately reach the goal for victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_4 -> 'f'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_3 -> 'i'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'j'\nbomb_2 -> 'k'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'l'\nbomb_1 -> 'm'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'n'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'o'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'p'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'q'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> q\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> p\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
