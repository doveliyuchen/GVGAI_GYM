It has a Bomberman-like mechanic where players use bombs strategically to navigate, defeat enemies, and reach objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites include the player's character (bomberman), enemies (bat, spider, scorpion), walls, bombs, and a goal (green door).\n- **Bombs**: Players can place bombs which explode and can eliminate enemies and destroy certain walls. \n- **Enemies**: The game includes different types of enemies that will interact with the player and can cause losses.\n- **Explosions**: The explosions from bombs can cause chain reactions and affect multiple sprites.\n- **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the goal sprite (green door) while managing enemies and bombs.\n\n#### Objective\nThe player's objective is to:\n- Reach the green door (goal).\n- Gain scores by smashing enemies and interacting with specific items.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the player (bomberman) reaches the goal (green door).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if their sprite counter for the bomberman reaches zero, which happens if they are killed by enemies or their own bombs.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Bomb Placement**: Strategically place bombs to maximize damage against enemies while ensuring that you are at a safe distance to avoid self-damage. Take note of the cooldowns for the different NCPs (e.g., bats spawn every 2 seconds).\n  \n2. **Control Enemy Movement**: Use the walls to your advantage to keep enemies away from you. If there are tight spaces, they might get stuck or take longer to reach you.\n\n3. **Clear Paths Methodically**: Incorporate a methodical approach to clear walls and enemies. Use bombs to open pathways that lead towards the goal while taking care not to trigger enemy interactions or traps.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions**: Set off chain explosions using strategically placed bombs that could take out groups of enemies or clear multiple walls in one go. \n\n5. **Avoid Friendly Fire**: Be cautious of placing bombs too close when enemies are present, as they can harm you.\n\n6. **Resource Management**: Keep track of bomb types and their interactions as each bomb type handles wall and enemy interactions differently; conserve your power for critical moments.\n\n7. **Explore the Map**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout to find the best routes to the goal and avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can navigate the game more effectively, staying alive longer while maximizing their score through strategic gameplay.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> %\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> i\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> d\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

Since **(row=4, col=10)** is only a wallBreak, moving right could allow us to prepare for a future action but doesn't take us closer to the goal.\n2. Moving **down (to row=5, col=9)** offers similar wallBreak potential.\n3. Moving **left (to row=4, col=8)** also achieves the same wall clearing.\n\nConsidering the current layout, the most strategic move seems to be to **move down** to **(row=5, col=9)**. This keeps options open for future actions while progressing toward clearing walls, especially since my last position will force me to move to the wallBreak or else be blocked by the explosion above.\n\n### Next Action\n``` Action:4 ```\nFeedback: Moving down to (row=5, col=9) opens up further opportunities to store power and clear the wallBreak below, aligning with the strategy to prepare the way toward the goal.",
