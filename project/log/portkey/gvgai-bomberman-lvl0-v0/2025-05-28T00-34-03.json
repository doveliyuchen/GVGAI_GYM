    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game can be classified as a **strategy-based puzzle game** with elements similar to **Bomberman**. Players navigate a grid-like environment, use bombs to eliminate enemies, and solve spatial challenges.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**:\n   - The player controls a character referred to as 'bomberman' who can place bombs.\n   - There are walls that obstruct movement, as well as destructible wall blocks.\n  \n2. **Bomb Placement**:\n   - Bombs can be placed strategically to cause explosions.\n   - Different bomb types exist (bomb_1 to bomb_10) which presumably vary in strength or effect.\n\n3. **Enemies**:\n   - Certain randomized enemy sprites (bats, spiders, scorpions) can harm the player.\n   - Players need to avoid contact with enemies and their own explosions to survive.\n\n4. **Goals and Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The goal is represented by a green door; reaching this door allows the player to win.\n   - Players lose if their sprite counter for 'bomberman' reaches zero, indicating that they have been defeated.\n\n5. **Interaction Triggers**:\n   - Various interactions occur based on environmental feedback, such as explosions killing enemies or both walls and explosions, adding a layer of strategy to actions.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objectives are:\n- Reach the green 'goal' sprite (the door) for victory.\n- Utilize bombs to defeat enemies to accumulate points and clear a path to the goal.\n  \n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite without having their own sprite counter (bomberman) reach zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the bomberman's sprite counter hits zero from enemy attacks or own explosions.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level\u2019s layout to navigate effectively and find the fastest route to the goal while avoiding enemies.\n  \n2. **Bomb Placement**:\n   - Strategically place bombs to eliminate groups of enemies or create openings in walls.\n   - Monitor the bomb countdowns to ensure you don\u2019t get caught in your own explosion.\n\n3. **Enemy Avoidance**:\n   - Be cautious of enemy movements and their spawn intervals; avoid pathways where you might be trapped between them.\n\n4. **Resource Management**:\n   - Use the bombs wisely; don't waste them carelessly. Keep track of how many different types you have left to manage the pressure.\n\n5. **Exploit Walls**: Use destructible walls to your advantage to create safe spaces or to lure enemies into bomb blasts.\n\n6. **Incremental Progress**: If overwhelmed, retreat and regroup before re-engaging. Sometimes, a defensive approach can yield more time to plan your attacks and movements.\n\nBy understanding the game mechanics and formulating strategies based on the level's layout and enemy behavior, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbomberman -> '@'\ngoal wallBreak -> '#'\nscorpion -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> *\nrow=1, col=17 -> %\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> &\nrow=2, col=16 -> *\nrow=2, col=17 -> &\nrow=2, col=18 -> *\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> j\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> &\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar (bomberman) is located at row 4, column 9. From here, the immediate surroundings consist primarily of walls, destructible walls, and a few enemies. The green door (goal) is located at row 2, column 14.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The goal is two rows above, requiring vertical movement, but there are walls blocking direct upward paths through column 9 and to the left and right.\n- There is also a wall (row 2, col 14) that might need to be destroyed to reach the green door. \n- I can see destructible wall blocks directly above my current position (row 4, col 8 and row 3, col 8) that could potentially be blown up to clear my path.\n- The closest destructible wall to me is at (row 4, col 8), and I can use a bomb to clear that.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo proceed towards my objective:\n1. Since I cannot move directly toward the goal due to walls, I need to break down the wall at (row 4, col 8) first.\n2. I will place a bomb there, which will allow me to clear this wall on my next turn. \n3. This strategic placement will not only clear my path but potentially take out any nearby enemies as well depending on the explosion spread.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI will place a bomb at my current location to break the wall at (row 4, col 8) and open up my path towards the goal. This aligns with the strategy of utilizing bombs effectively and navigating toward the win condition.",
