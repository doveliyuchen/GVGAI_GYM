    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game in terms of its genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game falls into the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players control a character (the avatar) that must navigate a level, solve puzzles, and interact with various objects and enemies to reach a goal.\n\n### Gameplay Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Avatar**: The main character that the player controls.\n   - **Key**: An item that transforms the avatar from nokey to withkey.\n   - **Goal**: The endpoint that must be reached to win, requiring the avatar to have the key.\n   - **Boxes and Mushrooms**: These can interact with the avatar and affect movement and score.\n   - **Walls and Holes**: Barriers and traps that the avatar must navigate around.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can move around the level, but must avoid holes (which result in death) and walls (which cause it to step back).\n   - Boxes can bounce the avatar and interact with walls and mushrooms.\n   - Collecting the key transforms the avatar into one having a key.\n   - The goal can only be completed if the avatar has transformed into the withkey sprite.\n\n### Objective\nThe player's main goal is to reach the goal sprite while managing interactions with keys, boxes, and other obstacles, ultimately scoring points by navigating the level successfully and avoiding death.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if they manage to reach the goal while being in the 'withkey' state (score changes depending on interactions).\n- The player loses if the avatar is killed (e.g., by falling into a hole or interacting with a mushroom).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Focus on carefully navigating the level to avoid pitfalls (holes) and hazards (mushrooms). The walls will restrict movement, so plan your route around them.\n   \n2. **Key Collection**: Prioritize obtaining the key to transition from nokey to withkey. This is necessary to successfully complete the level.\n\n3. **Leverage Boxes**: Use boxes strategically to bounce and navigate towards the key or create paths that allow for better positioning. Understand their interactions with walls and the potential to move away from hazards.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Avoid actions that lead to an immediate loss of the avatar, such as jumping into holes or interacting carelessly with mushrooms. \n\n5. **Optimize for Score**: Where possible, try to manage routes to avoid unwanted risks while collecting score-driving elements (like mushrooms).\n\nBy using these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, reach the goal, and achieve victory while minimizing the risk of losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

    "content": "Based on the provided state and layout of the game, it appears that the avatar (currently at row 2, column 4) does not have the key, which is located at row 1, column 1. Additionally, there are several obstacles, including holes (which can cause death) and mushrooms.\n\nThe immediate goal is to reach the key so that the avatar can transform to 'withkey', ultimately enabling the avatar to reach the goal located at (row 7, col 4). To get to the key, we need to navigate around dangers while ensuring that we don't step into a hole or bump into walls.\n\nGiven the current state:\n- The avatar is at (2, 4).\n- The nearest path to the key involves maneuvering around holes and walls. \n\nConsidering the layout, the next action should be to move left toward the direction of the key, which will also avoid pathways with holes. The avatar's current position allows movement to the left, which will also allow it to assess further pathways without immediately hitting a wall or entering a trap.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is necessary to move closer to the key while strategically avoiding hazards, following the overall strategy of key collection and safe navigation.",
