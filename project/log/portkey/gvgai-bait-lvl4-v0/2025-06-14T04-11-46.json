    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:**  Puzzle game, likely a Sokoban-style variant.\n\n**Objective:** To get the 'avatar' (player) to the 'goal' and ultimately remove all goals from the level.\n\n**Sprites and Their Roles:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player character. Can move around.\n*   **Floor:**  Empty space where the avatar can move. (hidden).\n*   **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **Hole:** Deadly traps. Kills the avatar if they fall in.\n*   **Key:** Collectible item.  Necessary to open the 'goal' (door).\n*   **Goal:** The exit, but requires the key to be opened.\n*   **Box:** Pushable object.  Used to solve puzzles.\n*   **Mushroom:** Seems to be a collectible for points, but also can undo levels when a box hits it along with a box and a wall.\n*   **Nokey:** Initial state of the player.\n*   **Withkey:** Player state after collecting a key.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The 'avatar' (player) can move around the level.\n*   **Pushing:** The 'box' sprite can be pushed by the 'avatar', similar to Sokoban.\n*   **Key Collection:** The 'avatar' needs to collect a 'key' to transform from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\".\n*   **Transformations:** The 'avatar' changes its sprite/state ('nokey' to 'withkey') upon collecting a key.\n*   **Scoring:**  Points are awarded for pushing boxes into holes and reaching the goal with the key.\n*   **Death/Restart:** Falling into a 'hole' kills the 'avatar', resulting in a loss.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The game is won when all 'goal' sprites are removed from the level, meaning that the player has reached and cleared all goal locations.\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   The game is lost if the 'avatar' sprite count reaches zero, meaning the player dies.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `k`: Key\n*   `0`: Floor\n*   `.`: Hole\n*   `m`: Mushroom\n*   `1`: Box\n*   `A`: Avatar (starting position)\n*   `g`: Goal\n\n**General Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:**  The first priority is to find and collect the 'key'.  This transforms the avatar into the 'withkey' state.\n2.  **Box Management:** Carefully plan box movements. Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they become unusable.  Use boxes to block holes or create pathways.\n3.  **Hole Avoidance:**  Be extremely careful to avoid falling into 'hole' sprites.\n4.  **Goal Achievement:**  Once you have the 'key', navigate to the 'goal' and 'killSprite' of goal to clear it (score points).\n5.  **Optimize Scoring:** If possible, try to push boxes into holes. This may or may not be required to complete the level, but it's a good way to maximize your score.\n6.  **Mushroom Avoidance (Usually):** It is best to avoid unintentionally activating mushrooms as they undo a lot of work, but in some levels, using mushrooms may be strategically advantageous.\n\n**In short:** This is a Sokoban-like puzzle game where you push boxes, collect keys, avoid traps, and open doors to win. Careful planning and spatial reasoning are essential.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",
