    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\n- The game fits into the puzzle platformer genre where players navigate through a level solving puzzles while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** Fixed surface where the avatar can move.\n   - **Hole:** Hazard that kills the avatar if they interact with it.\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can move and interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Objects (Key, Box, Mushroom):** Passive items that influence gameplay.\n   - **Goal:** The endpoint which the avatar must reach.\n   - **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n   \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar interacts with several sprites that either facilitate or hinder progress.\n   - Picking up a key transforms the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey', enabling entry into the goal.\n   - Certain sprites (like holes and mushrooms) kill the avatar, leading to a loss condition.\n   - Boxes can be used to bounce the avatar, potentially navigating around obstacles or traps.\n   \n3. **Scoring System:**\n   - Points are awarded for successfully interacting with certain items or completing objectives (e.g. reaching the goal with the key).\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate the level to reach the goal (closed door) while avoiding hazards like holes and mushrooms.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal with the key (no goals left = SpriteCounter limit = 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit of avatar = 0).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Navigation:**\n   - Study the level layout carefully before taking action. Note positions of walls, holes, and the goal.\n  \n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Move directly towards the key first, as it is essential for reaching the goal and transforming the avatar to a state where it can interact with the goal door.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Steer clear of holes and mushrooms to prevent immediate loss. Pay attention not to accidentally fall into hazards or bounce into them.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   - Utilize boxes for bouncing away from holes or walls to navigate safely, especially if the path is narrow or confusing.\n  \n5. **Prioritize Goal Entry:**\n   - Once the key is collected, directly head for the goal, ensuring that you have transformed into the 'withkey' state to avoid bouncing back or dying.\n\n6. **Be Cautious of the Blocks:**\n   - Use the blocks wisely\u2014remember that interactions can end in failure or success based on your positioning relative to them.\n\nFollowing these strategies will maximize your chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
