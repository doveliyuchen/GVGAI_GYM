    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Objective:** The primary goal is to reach the exit ('goal') *with* the key. A secondary, beneficial objective involves strategically pushing boxes into holes.\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an 'avatar' (initially 'nokey'). The avatar can move around the level.\n*   **Key Acquisition:** The avatar needs to pick up a 'key' to become 'withkey'.\n*   **Box Pushing:** The player can push 'box' sprites around.\n*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** The player needs to avoid holes, which are lethal. Walls prevent movement.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** Get the avatar ('withkey' form) to the 'goal' and remove the last 'goal' sprite from the level. This triggers a win.\n*   **Lose:** If the avatar is destroyed (falls into a hole or touches a mushroom), the game is lost.\n\n**Sprite Functionality:**\n\n*   **floor:** Background tile.\n*   **hole:** A deadly pit.\n*   **avatar (nokey/withkey):** The player-controlled character. 'nokey' is the initial state, 'withkey' is the state after picking up the key.\n*   **key:** Required to open the goal\n*   **goal:** The exit, only accessible with a key.\n*   **box:** Pushable blocks used to solve puzzles (potentially to fill holes).\n*   **wall:** Impassable barrier.\n*   **mushroom:** Deadly, kills the avatar\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n*   Pushing a box into a hole: +1 point.\n*   Touching a mushroom: +1 point, but also death.\n*   Reaching the goal with the key: +5 points.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: wall\n*   `k`: key\n*   `0`: floor\n*   `.`: floor\n*   `m`: mushroom\n*   `1`: box\n*   `A`: avatar (starting position, 'nokey' state)\n*   `g`: goal\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Acquisition:** The first and foremost goal is to get the key. Navigate the avatar to the 'k' location to transform into 'withkey'.\n2.  **Avoid Hazards:** Holes ('hole') and mushrooms ('mushroom') are instant death, so plan your route carefully.\n3.  **Box Manipulation:** Use the boxes to your advantage.\n    *  Potentially fill holes to create safe paths.\n    *  Strategically position boxes to access the key or the goal.\n4.  **Plan Ahead:** Box pushing is irreversible in most situations. Think through the consequences of each push before you make it.\n5.  **Goal Achievement:** Once you have the key and have cleared a path, navigate to the goal 'g' to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",
