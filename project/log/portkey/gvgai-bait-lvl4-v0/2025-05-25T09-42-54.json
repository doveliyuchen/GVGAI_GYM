    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the description of the game rules and interactions, it appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. Players must navigate a series of obstacles while interacting with various sprites to achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Solid ground.\n   - **Hole**: Danger\u2014contact results in losing the game.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Key**: An item that the avatar must collect to progress.\n   - **Mushroom**: An obstacle that also results in losing a life upon contact.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the endpoint where the avatar must reach using the key.\n   - **Boxes**: Can be moved and interact with other elements in the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can step back upon hitting walls.\n   - Falling into holes or colliding with mushrooms results in losing a life.\n   - Boxes can push the avatar forward and interact with walls and mushrooms leading to possible respawns.\n   - Collecting the key transforms the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" allowing interaction with the goal.\n   - The avatar must reach the goal with the key to win.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main goal of the game is to reach the **goal sprite** while avoiding obstacles such as **holes** and **mushrooms**. To reach the goal, the avatar must collect a **key** first. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar successfully reaches the goal after collecting the key (SpriteCounter for the goal reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar runs out of lives (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Study the level layout before making moves. Determine the locations of the key and the goal relative to the obstacles. \n\n2. **Avoid Obstacles**: Stay clear of holes and mushrooms that can lead to losing a life. Carefully navigate around or through openings that don't involve risk.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use the box sprite to bounce the avatar forward and perhaps position them strategically to avoid additional hazards. Note that boxes can undo interactions with walls and mushrooms if positioned correctly.\n\n4. **Collect the Key First**: Make it a priority to get the key; it is essential for accessing the goal.\n\n5. **Count Moves**: Keep track of how many moves are being made towards the objective and ensure that there are options available should the initial moves result in dead ends.\n\n6. **Use the Transform Mechanic**: Once you collect the key and transform your avatar, ensure you understand the new interactions available, especially for reaching the goal.\n\nBy mastering the mechanics of movement and interactions, carefully planning each step, and strategizing around the level layout, the player can successfully navigate and achieve the objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar (denoted by `*`) is located at (row 3, col 3). The key (denoted by `%`) is located at (row 1, col 1), while the goal (denoted by `#`) is at (row 7, col 4). \n\nNow, the objective is to reach the key first, as collecting it is necessary to progress and ultimately reach the goal.\n\n### Possible Moves for the Avatar:\n1. **Left (col - 1)** to (3, 2): This is a box (`@`), which can be interacted with but does not provide direct access to the key.\n2. **Right (col + 1)** to (3, 4): This is a free space (`.`) and does not provide immediate progress toward the key.\n3. **Up (row - 1)** to (2, 3): This is also free space (`.`).\n4. **Down (row + 1)** to (4, 3): This is free space (`.`).\n\nSince the direct path to the key requires moving left or up but does not provide immediate advancement toward the goal, the best action is to move in the right direction toward a valid path.\n\nTo move toward the key effectively, I should opt to **move upward (up)** from (3, 3) to (2, 3). \n\nLet's execute that action:\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\n\nI expect this move will put me in the vertical line of the key and provide more optimal options for gathering the key in subsequent turns.",
