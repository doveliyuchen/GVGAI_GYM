Players control an avatar that can interact with various objects in the environment, while solving puzzles to progress through levels by reaching a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can move around the level and interact with various objects (sprites) such as walls, boxes, mushrooms, holes, keys, and a goal.\n   - There are two states for the avatar: it can be either without a key (nokey) or with a key (withkey). Transforming from nokey to withkey occurs when the avatar interacts with a key. This is essential for reaching the goal.\n   - The avatar loses if it interacts with holes or certain other variables (like getting killed by mushrooms).\n   - The objective is to reach the goal while solving puzzles and avoiding certain sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Collisions with walls cause the avatar to step back.\n   - Colliding with holes results in losing the game (killed).\n   - Boxes can be used to bounce the avatar forward or interact with other objects for puzzle solutions.\n   - Keys are crucial for transforming the avatar state and reaching the goal.\n\n3. **Scoring:**\n   - Points can be gained by interacting with holes or mushrooms as well as reaching the goal with the key. \n   - Additionally, some interactions can result in penalties (like being killed).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to reach the goal sprite while ensuring that the avatar survives. The player needs to collect the key necessary to transform the avatar and open the goal door (which is closed initially).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win: Achieved by reaching the goal with the avatar transformed into the one with the key (withkey).\n- Loss: Occurs when either the avatar is killed by interacting with a hole or when the avatar's limit (number of avatars on-screen) reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration and Understanding:**\n   - Start by exploring the layout of the level to familiarize yourself with where the key, obstacles, and goal are located.\n   - Take note of wall placements since you will be stepping back when hitting walls, so plan paths carefully.\n\n2. **Key Collection:**\n   - Make it a priority to locate and collect the key to transform into the avatar with key (withkey). \n   - Pay attention to traps and enemies like holes and mushrooms, since they can lead to losing the game.\n\n3. **Use of Boxes:**\n   - Utilize boxes strategically to navigate the level and manipulate the environment. You can use boxes to bounce forward and avoid dangerous obstacles.\n   - If you find yourself near a wall or hole, consider whether to push or move boxes to create a safer path.\n\n4. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - Be mindful of the mushrooms and holes, as they can result in immediate loss. Carefully position your avatar to avoid collisions.\n   - If you have to maneuver around these hazards, ensure you have a clear plan to do so.\n\n5. **Reaching the Goal:**\n   - Once you have successfully transformed your avatar with the key, head to the goal promptly. Ensure to avoid retracing steps that would reduce your avatar\u2019s count unnecessarily.\n   - Double-check your path to the goal to prevent any unwanted interactions with obstacles.\n\nBy following these outlined strategies, players should be able to effectively navigate the challenges of the game, increase their survival rate, and work towards reaching the goal successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, let's summarize important features from the evident locations:\n\n1. **Avatar Position:** The avatar (nokey) is located at (3, 2).\n2. **Key Location:** The key is located at (1, 1).\n3. **Goal Location:** The goal is located at (7, 4).\n4. **Hazards:** There are holes which can be found at positions (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (6, 1). These must be avoided to prevent game over.\n5. **Boxes:** Boxes are present at (3, 4), (4, 4), and (5, 2), which can potentially help navigate around obstacles.\n\n### Next Steps:\nConsidering the avatar is positioned at (3, 2) and must reach (1, 1) to collect the key, the destination is clearly to the left at (1, 1). The avatars' movement should prioritize reaching the key while avoiding holes and other hazards. The block configuration behind and adjacent will require a strategy that does not risk movement into holes.\n\nThe action required should be to move the avatar left to position (3, 1). \n\nGiven the action plan:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is expected to place the avatar in a safer position to plan the next move without hitting obstacles or hazards.",
