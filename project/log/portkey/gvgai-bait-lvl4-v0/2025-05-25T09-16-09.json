    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThe game appears to fall within the puzzle-platformer genre. Players control an avatar navigating a grid-like environment, solving puzzles to progress towards a goal (in this case, represented by the 'goal' sprite).\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar that can move within the confines of a grid layout.\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites (holes, walls, mushrooms, keys, and goals).\n   - The avatar is negatively affected by holes and mushrooms, leading to loss of life and, consequently, a game loss if there are no avatars left.\n   - The avatar can pick up a key to transform from 'nokey' to 'withkey', allowing access to the goal.\n   - Other interactions involve pushing or being pushed by boxes, manipulating space, and potentially moving towards the goal.\n3. **Score Changes:** Some interactions yield score changes, indicating that while the primary objective is to reach the goal, collecting points through certain actions is also encouraged.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the 'goal' sprite while avoiding pitfalls (holes) and negative interactions (mushrooms). To successfully reach the goal, the avatar needs to obtain a key and potentially manipulate boxes to clear the path.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The game is won if the avatar reaches the goal while possessing the key (transformed from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n- **Loss:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed (e.g., by interacting with a hole or mushroom), resulting in the avatar count reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Careful Navigation:** Start by exploring the area carefully to avoid pitfalls (holes) and mushrooms. Plan your moves to avoid falling into traps and ensure you always have a safe path.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:** Work towards obtaining the key ('nokey' to 'withkey') as soon as possible. The key is necessary to reach the goal, so prioritize moving to it without backtracking into danger.\n\n3. **Puzzle Solutions with Boxes:** Use the boxes effectively to manipulate the environment. For example:\n   - Experiment with pushing boxes to different areas to create paths.\n   - Bounce boxes off walls to clear the way if necessary.\n   - Use the boxes strategically to avoid falling into holes.\n\n4. **Score Strategy:** While aiming for the goal, consider the potential scoring from interacting with mushrooms and killing holes where possible. This can add to your score, which may be beneficial for game progression or unlocking features (if applicable).\n\n5. **Plan Your Exit:** Once the key is collected and you are close to the goal, carefully plan your final moves to ensure you can make it to the goal without falling victim to traps or backtracking.\n\nFollowing this strategy should help navigate the complexities of the level effectively while working towards the ultimate goal of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
