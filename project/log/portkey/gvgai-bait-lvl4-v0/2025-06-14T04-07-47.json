    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle game, likely a Sokoban-inspired puzzle.\n\n**Objective:** To reach the goal (door) with the key and open the door to win.\n\n**Sprites (Game Elements):**\n\n*   `floor`: Invisible background tiles.\n*   `hole`: A hazard; falling in is bad.\n*   `avatar`: The player character; starts as `nokey`, transforms to `withkey` when it has the key.\n*   `nokey`: Player without the key.\n*   `withkey`: Player with the key.\n*   `mushroom`: Awards score when touched.\n*   `key`: Item needed to open the goal.\n*   `goal`: The exit; starts locked, requires the key to open.\n*   `box`: A pushable object that is part of the puzzles.\n*   `wall`: Obstacles that cannot be passed through.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player (`avatar`) can move around.\n*   **Pushing:** The player can push `box` sprites. Pushing a `box` against another `box`, a wall, or a mushroom causes an undo.\n*   **Key Collection:** The player (`nokey`) can pick up a `key` to become `withkey`.\n*   **Hazards:** `hole` sprites are dangerous and will kill the player.\n*   **Scoring:** Getting mushrooms or getting a box in a hole awards points.\n*   **Transformations:** The player transforms between `nokey` and `withkey` based on key acquisition.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All `goal` sprites are removed from the level (meaning the player has reached and opened all the doors).\n*   **Loss:** All `avatar` sprites are removed from the level (meaning the player has died).\n\n**Level Layout Key:**\n\n*   `w`: wall\n*   `k`: key\n*   `0`: floor\n*   `.`: hole\n*   `m`: mushroom\n*   `1`: box\n*   `A`: avatar (nokey)\n*   `g`: goal\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** The first priority is usually to find and pick up the `key`.\n2.  **Box Management:** Strategically push `box` sprites to create pathways or block off hazards. Be wary of pushing them into corners or against walls, as this might make the level unsolvable.\n3.  **Hazard Avoidance:** Stay away from `hole` sprites.\n4.  **Goal Access:** Once you have the `key` (`withkey`), navigate to the `goal` sprite to win.\n\nIn summary, it's a puzzle game where you need to collect a key, navigate around obstacles and hazards, and push boxes to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",
