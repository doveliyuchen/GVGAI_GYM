    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThe game appears to be a puzzle/platformer. Players control an avatar that navigates levels filled with various obstacles, items, and goals.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:**  \n   - **Avatar:** The player controls this character.\n   - **Wall, Floor:** Fixed elements of the environment that limit movement.\n   - **Holes:** Causes the avatar to die upon contact.\n   - **Key and Goal:** The key is necessary to progress through the goal (door) to complete the level.\n   - **Boxes and Mushrooms:** These can interact with the avatar or walls and cause various effects (e.g., bouncing, killing, scoring).\n  \n2. **Interactions:**  \n   - The avatar can walk into walls, which causes it to step back.\n   - Falling into holes results in losing the game (death).\n   - Boxes can bounce the avatar forward or when stacked against walls.\n   - The avatar interacts with keys, transforming into a version holding a key upon pickup. This transmutation is essential to access the goal.\n   - Certain interactions result in scoring points.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal is to collect the key and then reach the goal (door). The player must navigate through the level, avoiding holes, utilizing boxes, and managing interactions with mushrooms and walls.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** Successfully reaching the goal (door) with the key in possession.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar's counter reaches zero, indicating that the player has lost all lives, most likely through falling into holes or being killed by mushrooms.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Understand Movement:**  \n   - Avoid walls and interact positively with blocks. When moving boxes, be mindful of where they will end up to avoid being trapped or killed.\n\n2. **Plan Paths:**  \n   - Carefully consider the paths to collect the key while avoiding pits. It may be advantageous to stage box movements to create safe routes.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes:**  \n   - Use boxes to bounce off when appropriate and clear paths to the key and door while anticipating where the boxes can be used strategically.\n\n4. **Collect Keys Promptly:**  \n   - Prioritize obtaining the key as soon as possible to allow for direct access to the goal.\n\n5. **Watch the Environment:**  \n   - Stay vigilant for holes and mushrooms. Either avoid them or navigate around them efficiently to minimize risk.\n\n6. **Learn Level Layout:**  \n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of each level to predict potential traps and develop a success path to the goal and keys.\n\nThis strategy ensures effective navigation through the challenges presented in the game, maximizing the player's chances of success while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
