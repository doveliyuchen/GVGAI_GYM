The mechanics involve movement, interaction with objects, and problem-solving within a defined space.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites:** There are several types of sprites with defined roles:\n  - **Immovable Objects:** These include walls, floors, holes, and mushrooms.\n  - **Moving Avatar:** A player-controlled character that navigates the level.\n  - **Passive Objects:** These include keys and boxes that can be interacted with but do not possess movement.\n  \n- **Interactions:** Key interactions include:\n  - **Collision with walls** causes the avatar to step back.\n  - **Falling into holes** results in the avatar's defeat.\n  - **Bouncing off boxes** allows for movement adjustments.\n  - **Transforming sprites:** The avatar can change states based on collected keys.\n  - **Collecting keys** is crucial to access the goal, which is a door that must be unlocked.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to **collect the key** and use it to unlock the **goal** (door). The player must navigate the level while avoiding pits (holes) and hazards (mushrooms) that reduce health or cause death.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they reach the goal with the key (score change of +5) and all goal sprites have been removed from the level.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if their avatar is killed (e.g., falls into a hole or collides with a mushroom) or if the avatar count reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Level Layout:** Familiarize yourself with the map and identify the locations of key items (the key, the goal, and any hazards).\n  \n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:**\n   - Navigate to the key as quickly as possible. Use jumps and careful movement to avoid obstacles.\n   \n3. **Manage Hazards:**\n   - Avoid mushrooms that can result in quick losses (reduce health).\n   - Be careful near holes to prevent falling.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Utilize bounce mechanics to navigate tricky areas or to manipulate the environment. If boxes are in the way, consider moving them to clear a path or avoid falling.\n\n5. **Plan your Route:**\n   - Before making moves, plan how to reach the goal once you collect the key. Ensure your path minimizes encounters with hazards.\n\n6. **Practice Reacting Quickly:**\n   - Timing and reflexes are essential when navigating tight spots. Be prepared to step back from walls and avoid areas with holes.\n\n7. **Learn from Failures:**\n   - If the avatar dies, analyze what went wrong. Use that knowledge to improve decisions in future attempts.\n\nOverall, a combination of strategic navigation, object manipulation, and hazard avoidance will be essential to succeed in this puzzle-platformer game. Adapt quickly and think ahead to reach the door with the key!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

The first step is to assess the area where the key is located.\n2. Given the absence of the 'a' symbol, we assume the objective is still viable as my first action is focused on collecting the key.\n3. I'll take the action to move **UP** to reach row 1, col 1 where the key is located.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is to move upwards and approach the key at row 1, col 1; success in collecting the key will be critical to progress towards the goal.",
