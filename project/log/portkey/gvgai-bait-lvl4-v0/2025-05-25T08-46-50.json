Players navigate a series of obstacles, interact with various sprites, and must solve challenges to progress toward a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes different sprite types\u2014terrain (walls and floors), hazards (holes, mushrooms), collectibles (keys, boxes), and the avatar.\n2. **Avatar Movement**: The player controls a sprite called 'avatar' which can move and interact with other sprites.\n3. **Collectibles**: The key must be collected to progress through the goal, which is represented by a closed door.\n4. **Obstacles**: There are walls, and holes that can \"kill\" the avatar upon contact. Boxes serve as movable objects that can help manipulate the layout.\n5. **Goal Achievement**: The win condition is reaching the goal sprite (the door) with the right version of the avatar (having the key).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the 'goal' (a closed door) after obtaining the 'key.' This involves navigating the level's hazards and managing interactions with other sprites effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all 'goal' sprites (usually just one) have been reached with the 'withkey' avatar. This scores points and completes the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar's count reaches zero, typically by falling into holes or being harmed by mushrooms.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movement Carefully**: Factor in the placement of walls and holes which can kill your avatar. Avoid jumping into holes or rushing into hazards.\n2. **Collect the Key**: Make it a priority to transform the 'nokey' avatar into the 'withkey' avatar using the key. This is essential for reaching the goal.\n3. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Move boxes around to create safe paths or to prevent getting \"stuck\" by the player's position on the level.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Always check surrounding tiles for hazards, especially when planning the avatar\u2019s movement.\n5. **Score Management**: If possible, prioritize killing mushrooms (which yield a score) while still focusing on the goal completion. This may help in achieving higher scores even if you complete the main objective.\n\nBy following these strategies and applying logical thinking to the interactions available, players can effectively navigate through the levels while avoiding pitfalls and achieving the necessary goals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
