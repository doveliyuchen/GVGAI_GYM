    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nBased on the description and mechanics, this game appears to belong to the **platformer** genre with puzzle elements. The player navigates an environment, avoiding hazards while solving problems to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** Various sprites represent different elements in the game, including the player (avatar), obstacles (walls, holes, mushrooms), and interactive items (keys, boxes).\n- **Interaction Rules:** The avatar can interact with certain items, which can either result in gaining power (like collecting a key) or facing penalties (like falling into a hole or being killed by a mushroom).\n- **Transformation:** The avatar can gain the ability to open the goal door through interactions with keys.\n- **Scoring System:** Points are awarded by successfully navigating obstacles and solving puzzles, while losing points (or lives) can occur by hitting hazards.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective in the game is to reach the goal (the door) with the key. To do this, the player must efficiently navigate the level, avoid dangers, and convert themselves from the 'nokey' avatar to 'withkey' after collecting the key.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- Win Condition: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (with key) and the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero.\n- Loss Condition: The game is lost if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, meaning the player has run out of lives or can no longer continue.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Level:** Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify where walls, boxes, holes, and other obstacles are located. Pay special attention to how they interact with each other.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:** Make your way toward the key first. The key is essential for transforming from 'nokey' to 'withkey,' allowing you to access the exit door.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Utilize the boxes to bounce off and navigate the level, but be cautious as they can also trigger the kill mechanic if they interact with a hole.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards:** Stay away from holes and mushrooms as they can lead to losing lives or points. Always evaluate the risk before making a move.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path to the Goal:** Once you have the key, plan the most efficient route to the goal. Make sure to consider any obstacles that might redirect your path or cause you to lose lives.\n\n6. **Score Maximization:** Try to maximize score opportunities by killing mushrooms (if possible) or finding creative ways to use hazards and items to your advantage.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can effectively navigate through the challenges, achieve the game objectives, and ultimately win the game. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",
