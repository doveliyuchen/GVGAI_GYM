    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThe game can be classified as a **puzzle-platformer**. It involves navigating a character through a level while encountering various obstacles and utilizing items to achieve a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: The ground the avatar can walk on.\n   - **Hole**: A hazardous area that kills the avatar upon contact.\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player, which can move around the level.\n   - **Key & NoKey**: Items that allow or prevent the avatar from accessing certain areas.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the exit or level completion point.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be interacted with; it acts as a platform and can be used to solve puzzles.\n   - **Mushroom**: Another obstacle that kills the avatar on contact and provides a score change.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls (stepping back), holes (dying), boxes (bouncing), keys (transforming from nokey to withkey), and goals (progressing or stepping back based on key possession).\n   - Collecting keys is essential for accessing the goal.\n   - Certain interactions involve scoring, indicating there may be an incentive for collecting or avoiding items.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a win when there are no goals left on the screen.\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar is eliminated, suggesting a life system.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is:\n- To collect a key, transform the avatar to the \"withkey\" state, and reach the goal (door) to win.\n- Avoid dying by either falling into holes, hitting mushrooms, or having insufficient keys when trying to reach the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: All goal sprites must be eliminated (passed through with the key).\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar must not reach a sprite limit of zero, thereby resulting in a game over.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore Carefully**: Move around the level to identify the locations of keys and obstacles, while avoiding holes and mushrooms.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes effectively to navigate around hazards and possibly reach higher platforms or to manipulate other sprites\u2014like hitting a box against a wall or using it to bounce forward to avoid death by holes.\n\n3. **Collect the Key**: Focus on reaching the key quickly to minimize potential hazards and transition to the \"withkey\" state which is crucial for progressing to the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Your Moves**: Before making moves, consider the interactions with wall sprites and obstacles to ensure that you do not accidentally step back or die.\n\n5. **Mind Your Steps**: Always be conscious of your surroundings when moving near hazards, especially in areas with multiple obstacles like holes and mushrooms.\n\n6. **Prioritize the Goal**: Once you have the key, head directly to the goal (door) to win. Avoid unnecessary risks and focus on reaching the objective.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively navigate the challenges presented in the game, allowing you to reach the goal successfully while avoiding death and optimizing your score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",
