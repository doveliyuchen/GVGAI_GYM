    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game appears to fall into the puzzle and platformer genre. It involves strategic movement and interaction with various sprites to achieve specific objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game includes several sprites representing the player (avatar), obstacles (walls, holes), items (keys, mushrooms, boxes), and the end goal (goal/door).\n- **Movement:** The player character can move around, interact with walls, holes, items, and the goal.\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can walk into walls, causing it to step back, and can fall into holes, which leads to losing a life.\n  - Boxes can bounce the avatar forward and be manipulated to achieve goals.\n  - Keys are crucial to accessing the goal \u2013 the avatar needs a key to change into a state that allows them to successfully interact with the goal sprite.\n  - The avatar gains points by interacting with mushrooms (bonus), while encountering them results in a life loss.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to collect the key and reach the goal (door) while managing obstacles and hazards, such as holes and mushrooms. Successfully reaching the goal while in possession of the key will change the state of the goal and yield points.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal sprite while having the key. This drops the goal and awards points.\n- **Loss Condition:** Lose all avatars (lives) by either falling into holes or encountering mushrooms before success.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Understand Your Environment:** Familiarize yourself with the layout. Avoid holes and plan the path to the goal while determining the location of the key.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:** Boxes can help in overcoming obstacles. Position boxes to create a safe pathway or to navigate around traps like hole sprites.\n\n3. **Manage Interactions:** Carefully consider what happens when you interact with different sprites. For example, approaching the goal without the key steps you back. \n\n4. **Collect the Key Early:** Make it a priority to get the key, as this is essential for approaching the goal. Transitioning from nokey to withkey is your ticket to victory.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of mushrooms since they result in losing life points. Keep a safe distance whenever possible.\n\n6. **Plan Your Moves:** Since the avatar can't just move through walls, strategize your moves to avoid unnecessary interactions with holes and walls.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the interactions of the sprites within the game, players will increase their chances of successfully completing levels and achieving a high score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state, the avatar is located at (4, 1) on the map, which corresponds to the nokey floor represented by '*'. The goal is located at (7, 4) represented by '#'.\n\n### Analyzing the Current State:\n1. The key ('%') is located at (1, 1).\n2. The avatar must first obtain the key in order to successfully reach the goal ('#').\n3. There are various obstacles in the way; however, the avatar is positioned where it can potentially move left into the unoccupied space or interact with boxes at its vicinity.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The immediate goal is to navigate the avatar to the key located at (1, 1).\n- Avoid the hazards such as mushrooms ('&') in row 3 and ensure that no unnecessary moves are made towards holes ('$').\n\n### Possible Moves:\nCurrently, the most viable action would be to move left towards (4, 0), but the wall ('b') blocks that potential move. The logical move that would bring the avatar closer to the key would be to move up to (3, 1).\n\n### Turn Action:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar up towards the next row in the game, bringing it one step closer to navigating towards the key while still allowing observation of surroundings to avoid hazards.",
