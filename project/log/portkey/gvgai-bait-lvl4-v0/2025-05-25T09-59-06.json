Players navigate through a level with various obstacles and interactable objects, requiring both strategic movement and puzzle-solving to progress.\n\n#### **Game Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor & Walls**: These are immovable elements that define the game\u2019s boundaries and layout.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move through the level.\n   - **Key**: A collectible item that is essential for interaction with the goal.\n   - **Goal**: The endpoint of the level that players need to reach with a specific condition.\n   - **Mushroom and Box**: Passive elements that can cause interactions with the avatar or other sprites, affecting movement or progression.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can only move in a limited way, being pushed back by walls.\n   - Falling into a hole results in a loss of the avatar.\n   - Interacting with boxes can propel the avatar forward but their interaction with holes can lead to mutual destruction.\n   - Picking up the key transforms the avatar state, allowing interaction with the goal.\n   - Collisions with mushrooms cause a loss of the avatar but with rewards.\n\n#### **Objective**\nThe primary goal is to navigate through the level, collect a key, and ultimately reach the goal door. To accomplish this, players must manipulate boxes and avoid pitfalls, using the collected key to unlock the goal.\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win**: The player successfully reaches the goal (door) while in the correct state (with the key).\n- **Loss**: The avatar either falls into a hole, is killed by a mushroom, or runs out of avatars (i.e., SpriteCounter for avatar reaching 0).\n\n### **Overall Strategy**\n1. **Careful Movement**: As the avatar can be killed by holes and mushrooms, cautious navigation is crucial. Always be aware of surroundings to avoid unnecessary losses.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use boxes strategically to maneuver around obstacles and position them in such a way that they don\u2019t interact with the holes when moving.\n\n3. **Collect the Key**: Ensure to collect the key before heading to the goal door. The transformation into \"withkey\" is crucial for successfully interacting with the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Mushrooms**: Stay away from mushrooms, as they cause a loss of the avatar. If a box interacts with a mushroom, be prepared for the potential consequences.\n\n5. **Pitfalls Awareness**: Be mindful of the holes in the level's layout; plan movements to avoid any situation where the avatar could inadvertently fall.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead**: Analyze the level layout before making significant movements. Understanding the placement of walls, boxes, mushrooms, and holes can inform better strategic decisions.\n\n7. **Experimentation**: If stuck, try different interactions (with boxes and walls) to see if there are alternate ways to manipulate the environment for progression.\n\nUsing these strategies effectively will help navigate the level, overcome obstacles, and ultimately reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
