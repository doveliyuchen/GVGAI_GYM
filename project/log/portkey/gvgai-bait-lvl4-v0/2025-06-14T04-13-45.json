    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game:\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, a Sokoban-style puzzle with added elements)\n\n**Objective:**  The player (avatar) needs to reach the goal (door) while carrying a key.\n\n**Sprites and Their Roles:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player-controlled character. Starts as 'nokey' (no key), transforms to 'withkey' once they get a key.\n*   **Floor:**  The basic walkable area. Hidden, so visually unimportant.\n*   **Hole:** A hazard that kills the avatar.\n*   **Mushroom:** A collectible that kills the avatar and gives you one score.\n*   **Key:** Needed to open the goal. Picking it up transforms the avatar.\n*   **Goal:** The exit, which requires the key to open.\n*   **Box:**  A movable object that can be pushed.\n*   **Wall:** Impassable barrier.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls the 'avatar' sprite.\n*   **Pushing:** The player can push 'box' sprites. Pushing a box against another box or a wall or a mushroom will undo all the actions (very strange and might mean the game creator did not want the player to get stuck)\n*   **Key Acquisition:** The avatar starts without a key ('nokey'). Touching a 'key' transforms the avatar into 'withkey'. Touching a key while being avatar causes the player to die\n*   **Transformation:** 'nokey' transforms into 'withkey' upon interacting with the 'key'.\n*   **Score:** Score is gained when the Avatar touches a mushroom or opens the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All 'goal' sprites are removed (meaning the player has opened all the doors).\n*   **Loss:** All 'avatar' sprites are removed (the player dies).\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `k`: Key\n*   `g`: Goal\n*   `0`: floor\n*   `1`: box\n*   `.`: hole\n*   `m`: mushroom\n*   `A`: Avatar\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Get the Key:** The primary objective is to guide the 'nokey' avatar to the 'key'. Be careful, touching the key as an avatar will cause the player to die. This will transform the sprite into the 'withkey' avatar.\n2.  **Navigate to the Goal:** Once the avatar has the key ('withkey'), navigate to the 'goal'.\n3.  **Avoid Hazards:** Holes are instant death. Avoid them at all costs. Also try to avoid Mushrooms, since they will kill you.\n4.  **Box Pushing:** Use the boxes to clear paths, block holes, or create pathways. Be careful not to get stuck.\n5. **Solve the puzzle:** You can win the level by opening the door if the player has the key.\n\nIn essence, this game seems like a Sokoban variant with a key-collecting element and some additional hazards. The core puzzle will likely revolve around strategic box pushing.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",
