The emphasis on strategy, interactions, and environmental elements suggests a puzzle-solving component.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent the different components of the game such as the avatar, obstacles (walls, holes), collectibles (keys), goals, and interactive objects (boxes, mushrooms).\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the map but is restricted by walls and holes.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can interact with other sprites in specific ways (e.g., transforming when collecting a key, stepping back when encountering walls).\n- **Scoring**: There are points associated with certain interactions (e.g., getting a key, encountering mushrooms).\n  \n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal sprite, which is a door, using keys obtained in the level. Players must manage their interactions with various obstacles and collectibles to navigate efficiently.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero, meaning the player has successfully reached the door with the key(s) required.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, indicating that the player has run out of available moves or has been killed.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the level layout (designated by `0`s for open spaces and `w`s for walls, etc.) to understand potential paths and obstacles. Look for patterns and potential dead ends.\n2. **Key Management**: Focus on collecting keys as quickly as possible, transforming the nokey into withkey to unlock the goal door.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of holes and mushrooms since they result in losing the avatar (and therefore time), and always plan movements around them to avoid death.\n4. **Box Usage**: Use the boxes strategically to navigate the layout. They can bounce the avatar forward when interacted with, allowing for clearing certain gaps or positioning.\n5. **Keep Score in Mind**: While reaching the goal is the main aim, accumulating points from interactions (like killing mushrooms) may provide additional advantages or rewards.\n\nBy understanding these strategies and mechanics, players can optimize their paths and take calculated risks to progress through the puzzle while trying to minimize loss of the avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

I expect this move to align with the goal of maximizing my score and progressing toward the level's objective.",
