    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game appears to fall within the puzzle-platformer genre, where players navigate through a level while solving problems and avoiding hazards using platforming mechanics.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites**: Various types of sprites are present, each with distinct properties and interactions. These include the player-controlled 'avatar', stationary 'walls', 'holes' that are lethal, 'mushrooms' that grant points, 'keys' for unlocking doors, and 'goals'.\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar can move around the level, but is stopped by walls, indicated by the interaction of stepping back.\n  - Holes will cause the avatar to \"die\" upon contact.\n  - Boxes can be bounced off walls or used to fall into holes for scoring.\n  - Keys are involved in transforming the player's status from unarmed to armed, or vice versa, and are vital for accessing the goal.\n  - The avatar must collect the key to unlock the goal in order to win.\n\n- **Scoring**: \n  - Players score points by collecting mushrooms and causing interactions that yield points.\n\n**Objectives:**  \n- The main objective is to collect the key and reach the goal (the door) to win the game. \n- Secondary objectives include scoring points by interacting with mushrooms and managing the box interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win**: The game is won if there are no 'goal' sprites left in play.\n- **Loss**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated or if there are no remaining instances of the avatar sprite, indicating that the player can\u2019t play anymore.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Navigational Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout before making movements. Note the positions of walls, holes, boxes, mushrooms, and the goal.\n  \n2. **Key Acquisition**: Focus on obtaining the key first. This is essential to unlocking the goal. The key is represented by transforming from 'nokey' to 'withkey', so ensure you interact with it as a priority.\n  \n3. **Risk Management**: Be cautious around holes, which strictly eliminate your avatar. Use walls strategically to navigate away from danger.\n\n4. **Leverage Boxes**: Use boxes for movement and scoring. The boxes can bounce off walls to reposition your avatar, and they can also be sacrificed (by falling into a hole) for point collection.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Collect mushrooms whenever possible. While the primary goal is to reach the goal with the key, accumulating points from mushrooms can provide a safety buffer against other game mechanics.\n\n6. **Plan Moves**: Reflect on each move and consider the interactions\u2014like bouncing a box or positioning your avatar\u2014to avoid being cornered by walls or holes.\n\nBy following these strategies, players should enhance their chances of maximizing their score while progressing towards the goal efficiently and effectively!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is located at row 3, column 2 (where the key \"nokey\" is represented by *). The avatar needs to transform to \"withkey\" by collecting the key, represented by % at row 1, column 1, in order to unlock the goal (#) located at row 7, column 4.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- The avatar's current position does not have the key.\n- The goal is reachable only after obtaining the key, which is two rows above and two columns left of the avatar.\n- The movement option toward the direction of the key is to either go up or left.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nTo move toward the key effectively, the avatar should first move up to row 2, column 2 (which is an empty . space):\n\n1. **First Action**: Move UP from (3,2) to (2,2).\n  \n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis will allow me to navigate closer to the key.
