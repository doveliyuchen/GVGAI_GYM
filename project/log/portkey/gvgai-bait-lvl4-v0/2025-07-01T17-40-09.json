    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a puzzle-platformer with elements of navigation and resource management. The objective seems to revolve around problem-solving to navigate through levels while avoiding obstacles and completing specific tasks.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game has multiple sprite types, including:\n   - Immovable objects (like walls, floors, and mushrooms)\n   - Moving avatars (the player's character)\n   - Passive objects (boxes and keys)\n   - Goal objects (doors)\n\n2. **Interactions**: Various interactions define the mechanics of the game:\n   - **Movement and Collision**: The avatar can step back from walls, fall into holes (resulting in death), and bounce off boxes.\n   - **Transformation and Collection**: The avatar interacts with keys to transform into a different state.\n   - **Scoring**: Players gain scores from certain actions (e.g., collecting keys or interacting with mushrooms).\n   - **Goal Completion**: The goal can only be accessed when the avatar holds the key.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a win state when all goal sprites are gone (i.e., the player has cleared the level).\n   - The game ends in a loss state if the avatar is killed (i.e., runs out of lives).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite while solving puzzles involving the collection and usage of keys and avoiding hazards like holes and the avatar's death.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Collect the key and reach the goal without losing all lives (automatically fails if the avatar counter hits zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed.\n\n**Level Layout Analysis:**\nThe given level layout shows a grid-like design with walls (denoted by 'w'), potential key locations (designated as 'k'), the goal (represented as 'g'), and holes (when the avatar falls and dies).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Identify**: Start by exploring the level layout to become familiar with the position of walls, gaps, keys, and the goal.\n  \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious around holes and mushrooms, as they can lead to immediate loss of lives. Plan your movements carefully to avoid falling in.\n\n3. **Collect Keys**: Focus on locating and collecting keys to transform your avatar. The key is necessary to access the goal, leading to a win.\n\n4. **Utilize Boxes**: Use boxes strategically as they can bounce your avatar, allowing you to navigate gaps safely or interact with other elements effectively.\n\n5. **Manage Movements**: Be aware of your movements against walls and other objects. If you bump into walls or get too close to holes, you may lose your avatar.\n\n6. **Focus on the Goal**: Always maintain a line of sight toward the goal, and plan your route to avoid backtracking.\n\n7. **Count Lives and Score**: Keep track of your avatar's life count and aim to maximize score by interacting with mushrooms and boxes while staying alive.\n\nBy adopting this strategy, players can maximize their efficiency and enhance their chances of successfully completing levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nbox goal -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> h\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

The next steps involve moving towards the key while avoiding falling in any holes.\n\n### Action Decisions\nSince the goal is to reach Row 1, Column 1 (the key), the next logical action for the avatar, if it's starting on Row 1, Column 2, is to move left to collect the key.\n\nBased on the current position of the avatar (assumed to be Row 1, Column 2) and to collect the key, I would take the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis move is designed to collect the key, fulfilling a critical part of the strategy and aligning with the overarching goal of reaching the goal after collecting the key.",
