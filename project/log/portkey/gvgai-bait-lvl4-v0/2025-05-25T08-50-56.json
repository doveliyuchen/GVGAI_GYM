    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game likely falls into the puzzle platformer genre. It involves moving an avatar (player character) through a level filled with obstacles, keys, and goals, while also incorporating strategic interactions between different types of sprites.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- The player controls an avatar, which can move around the level.\n- There are wall sprites that prevent the avatar from passing through them (resulting in a \"step back\" interaction).\n- The objective is to navigate through various components (such as boxes, keys, and mushrooms) to reach a goal sprite.\n- Sprites can interact in specific ways:\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes.\n  - Picking up a key transforms the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" state.\n  - Hitting specific objects (like holes) can lead to losing the game.\n  - Collecting mushrooms can also lead to points.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite while managing interactions with other sprites (e.g., keeping to avoid death from holes or walls). The goal sprite only opens when the avatar is holding a key.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar in the \"withkey\" state. This denotes successfully navigating the level and collecting the key.\n- Loss: The player loses if the avatar encounters a hole or if the avatar is eliminated without reaching the goal (limited avatar count reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level Layout**: Familiarize yourself with how walls, boxes, holes, and other items are laid out to formulate a route to the goal. Be mindful of walls that block movement.\n  \n2. **Collect the Key**: Make it a priority to reach the key as soon as possible. This transformation from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" is essential to ultimately completing the level.\n\n3. **Strategic Jumping and Movement**: Be cautious while moving near holes and walls. Plan every move while considering the \"step back\" mechanic to prevent falling into holes.\n\n4. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Using boxes to bounce forwards can be advantageous for quick movement. However, ensure they are positioned such they do not obstruct your path or can lead to unintended consequences when interacting with holes.\n\n5. **Be Cautious of Mushrooms**: While mushrooms can give you a score boost, they can also lead to losing a life. Decide whether it's worth the risk based on your current avatar count.\n\n6. **Final Push to the Goal**: Once you have the key, make a direct path to the goal while avoiding all hazards. If possible, calculate any potential risks of using nearby boxes that could endanger your path.\n\nBy understanding these elements and carefully planning movements and interactions, players can effectively navigate through the levels and reach their goals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
