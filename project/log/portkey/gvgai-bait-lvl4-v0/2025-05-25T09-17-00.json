Players navigate through a level while solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles, and interacting with various sprites.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** Represents the base on which the avatar and other objects can stand.\n   - **Hole:** A dangerous area that results in losing a life.\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Key:** An essential item needed to open the goal.\n   - **Goal:** The end point for each level, which requires the key to be reached.\n   - **Mushroom and Box:** Objects that can interact with the avatar in various ways, including bonus points or hindrances.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can step back when hitting walls.\n   - Falling into a hole results in losing the game. \n   - The box can bounce the avatar forward.\n   - If the avatar collects a key (when starting with 'nokey'), it transforms into 'withkey'.\n   - Collecting the key and reaching the goal with the transformed avatar scores points.\n   - Interacting with mushrooms or holes can lead to scoring or losing.\n\n3. **Terminations Conditions:**\n   - The game is won by successfully reaching the goal while having the key.\n   - The game is lost if the avatar is defeated (falls into a hole or is eliminated by a mushroom).\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite (`goal`) after converting the avatar from `nokey` to `withkey` by interacting with the key sprite.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully obtain the key and reach the goal sprite (`goal withkey`).\n- **Loss Condition:** Lose the avatar upon falling into a hole or being killed by the mushroom.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Before moving, assess the layout. Identify where key and hole sprites are located to avoid hazards.\n\n2. **Obtain the Key:**\n   - Move towards the key as quickly as possible to transform your avatar. This is the critical step for progress.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious when approaching mushrooms and holes. Plan jumps and movements to avoid falling into a hole or touching a mushroom.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Boxes can help you navigate by bouncing your avatar forward or interacting with obstacles. Use them to puzzle your way out of tight spots.\n\n5. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - After obtaining the key, head towards the goal smoothly to maximize your points.\n\nBy focusing on the methodical collection of the key while navigating safely past hazards, players can successfully complete levels and maximize their scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
