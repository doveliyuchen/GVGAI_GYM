    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the description of the game rules, it appears to belong to the puzzle-platformer genre, where the player navigates a character through a series of obstacles to achieve specific goals. \n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites such as the avatar, key, and goal, each with their own interactions and effects on gameplay.\n- **Movement & Interaction**: The player controls the avatar and can interact with other sprites (boxes, keys, mushrooms) to solve puzzles and achieve objectives.\n- **Goals & Hazards**: The goal is to reach a specific endpoint (the door) after navigating obstacles, while avoiding hazards (walls, holes, mushrooms) that diminish the player's score or cause a loss.\n\n### Objectives:\nThe primary objective is to collect the key and use it to successfully reach the goal, while managing encounters with obstacles and hazards.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero, which means the player has successfully interacted with the goal after collecting a key.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has been lost (either through falling into holes or other deadly interactions).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be cautious of walls and holes, as they can result in losing the avatar. \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can be moved around to create platforms or buffer zones. When interacting with walls and mushrooms, look for opportunities to move boxes effectively without losing them.\n3. **Collect the Key**: You must find the key as it is essential for opening the goal. Make sure to keep track of its location.\n4. **Plan Your Moves**: Before acting, plan a sequence of moves that leads you from your starting position to the goal while avoiding immediate hazards.\n5. **Score Management**: Be mindful of getting the bonus from interacting with mushrooms and other sprites that can increase your score, while still keeping yourself safe.\n\n### Overall Game Analysis:\nThis game combines elements of strategic thinking and spatial awareness typically found in puzzle-platformers. Players must use logic to navigate the environment, manipulate objects around them, and avoid dangers to succeed. Key skills will include planning moves ahead of time, analyzing consequences, and strategically managing interactions with various game elements to optimize progress towards the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nbox goal -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> b\nrow=1, col=3 -> b\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> h\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b",

    "content": "The current state of the game indicates the following relevant features:\n\n- The avatar is at position (row=2, col=3), which is an empty floor represented by '.'. \n- The key is located at (row=1, col=1), which is represented by '%'.\n- There are boxes (@) at (row=2, col=4) and (row=2, col=5).\n- Hazards (holes) are present at (row=2, col=1), (row=3, col=1), and (row=3, col=2).\n- The goal is located at (row=7, col=4), marked by 'h'.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis:\n1. The avatar is safe on the floor and not in immediate danger.\n2. The key is one move upward to (row=1, col=1), which is necessary to collect.\n3. Moving directly up to collect the key from (row=2, col=3) to (row=1, col=1) will put the avatar at risk of falling into a hole, so that action is not valid.\n4. I will need to maneuver around obstacles, especially since there is a wall surrounding the upper boundary.\n\n### Next Action Strategy:\nTo collect the key while avoiding hazards, I can move left to (row=2, col=2) and then up to (row=1, col=1) from there. This will prevent the avatar from hitting any holes.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move to the left is consistent with the strategy of maneuvering towards the key without encountering immediate hazards. I expect the avatar to remain safe and effectively position for the next move towards the goal.",
