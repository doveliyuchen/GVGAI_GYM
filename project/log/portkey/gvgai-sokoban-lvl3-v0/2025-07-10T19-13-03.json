When a box bumps into the avatar it \u201cbounces forward\u201d, meaning it continues moving, which can create chain reactions.\n\u2022 If a box touches a wall and immediately contacts another box (described as \u201cbox wall box\u201d), an undo mechanism is triggered (\u201cundoAll\u201d), likely meaning that an illegal push or chain reaction resets recent moves.\n\u2022 Most importantly, when a box is pushed into a hole, the box is removed (\u201ckilled\u201d) and a score is awarded.\n\nObjective and Win Condition:\n\u2022 Your goal is to eliminate all the boxes from the level by pushing them into the holes.\n\u2022 The game is won when there are no boxes left on the grid (the SpriteCounter for boxes hits zero).\n\u2022 While a loss condition isn\u2019t explicitly given in these rules, unsuccessful moves (such as triggering an undo by causing problematic collisions) may force you to replan your steps.\n\nOverall Strategy:\n\u2022 Analyze the level layout to plan a clear path for each box toward a hole. Think ahead about how your pushes will move the boxes, especially with the bouncing mechanics.\n\u2022 Since the avatar will \u201cstep back\u201d if you run into walls, position your avatar carefully so that you don\u2019t accidentally undo a move you need.\n\u2022 Make sure to avoid pushing boxes into configurations that might trigger the \u201cundoAll\u201d rule (like a box directly forced against another with a wall in between) as this can cancel your progress.\n\u2022 Work systematically: first plan which box should go to which hole, then reposition yourself around the level to push them one at a time without interfering with boxes that are already in a good position.\n\u2022 Use the bounce behavior strategically. Sometimes a box can be made to \u201cbounce\u201d into a hole from a distance, helping you avoid tight maneuvers.\n\u2022 Be prepared to backtrack if a move causes an unintended chain reaction. Sometimes undoing moves is part of the learning process in these puzzles.\n\nIn summary, think carefully about every push you make, plan several moves ahead, and aim to get every box into a hole without triggering undo penalties. With careful planning and a focus on the geometric layout of walls, boxes, and holes, you can solve the puzzle and win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> 0\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",
