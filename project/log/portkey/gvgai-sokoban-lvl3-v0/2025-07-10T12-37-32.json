    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's my analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle. Specifically, a Sokoban-style puzzle game, also known as a box-pushing puzzle.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player (avatar) can move around the level.\n*   **Pushing:** The player can push boxes.\n*   **Immovable Objects:** Walls and floors restrict movement. Holes are also obstacles, but they can be part of the solution.\n*   **One-Way Pushing:** The player can only push one box at a time.\n*   **Limited Movement:** Pushing a box into another box or a wall will cause the boxes to be in their original position.\n\n**Objective:** Push all the boxes into the holes.\n\n**Win Condition:** All boxes are removed from the level when pushed into holes. SpriteCounter tracks the number of boxes and if it reaches 0, the player wins.\n\n**Loss Condition:** No explicit loss condition is defined, but the game will effectively be lost if the player gets a box stuck in a corner or against a wall in a way that it cannot be moved into a hole. This will make it impossible to win.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `.`: Floor\n*   `0`: Box\n*   `1`: Box\n*   `A`: Avatar start position\n*   The number on a box isn't relevant.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:**  Sokoban games require careful planning. Think several moves ahead before pushing any box.  Consider where the other boxes are and how your moves will affect their positions.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:**  Getting a box stuck in a corner is almost always a game over. Be very careful about pushing boxes into corners or along walls where they could become trapped.\n3.  **Isolate Boxes:** Sometimes it's necessary to isolate a box early on, positioning it so that you can easily maneuver it into a hole later.\n4.  **Use Walls Strategically:**  Walls can be used to your advantage to guide boxes into the correct positions.\n5.  **Restart When Necessary:** Don't be afraid to restart the level if you make a mistake early on. It's often better to start over than to try to salvage a bad situation.\n6.  **Prioritize Key Boxes:** Identify the boxes that are most likely to get stuck and focus on moving them into favorable positions first.\n7.  **Look for Open Spaces:** Try to maintain open spaces so you have room to maneuver boxes. Cramped spaces are your enemy.\n8.  **Consider the Order:** The order in which you push the boxes is crucial. Often you need to move one box out of the way to get to another.\n9.  **\"BounceForward\" limitation:** This mechanic means you can only push one box at a time and also means that it's crucial that you have space behind you to move so you can \"bounceForward\".\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> 0\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",
