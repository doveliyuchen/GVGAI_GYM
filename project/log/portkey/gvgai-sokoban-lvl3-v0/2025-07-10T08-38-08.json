    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThis game appears to fit within the puzzle genre, specifically a tile-based or box-pushing puzzle category, somewhat akin to games like \"Sokoban\" or \"Boxxle.\" Players must navigate a character (the avatar) and interact with objects (boxes) in a constrained environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** There are several types of sprites in the game, including:\n  - **Floor:** Represents the ground the avatar can move on.\n  - **Hole:** A location that will 'kill' any box that falls into it.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n  - **Box:** A movable object that can be pushed around the level.\n  - **Wall:** Solid barriers that the avatar cannot pass through.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar will step back if it tries to move against a wall.\n  - When the avatar collides with a box, it pushes the box forward.\n  - If a box collides with a wall, it returns to its previous position.\n  - If a box falls into a hole, it is removed from the play area, and the player\u2019s score changes by an increment (suggesting that getting boxes into holes is favorable).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to eliminate all boxes from the level. This is achieved by pushing boxes into the holes. The game ends when there are no more boxes left on the screen.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins the game when the sprite counter for boxes reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game does not explicitly state a loss condition in the provided rules. However, if the player runs out of moves or boxes to push, they may indirectly lose.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Since the environment is constrained, it is essential to think several moves ahead. Consider the consequences of each move before making it.\n\n2. **Use the Walls Wisely:** You can use walls strategically to bounce boxes towards the holes. Avoid pushing them into corners where they become hard to move.\n\n3. **Maximize Box Drops:** Focus on positioning your avatar to push as many boxes into holes as possible in a single sequence of moves.\n\n4. **Minimize Backtracking:** Try to plan your route in such a way that you do not need to backtrack unless necessary; getting stuck might waste your moves or position.\n\n5. **Look for Patterns:** If multiple boxes are present, find patterns in how you can move them effectively without blocking each other.\n\nOverall, patience and strategic planning are key in successfully navigating through the puzzles in this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> 0\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",

The optimal strategy is to either move to push the box at (row=4, col=4) down into the hole at (row=4, col=1) or aim to push the box at (row=5, col=2) towards the upper hole.\n\nSince the avatar does not change position after the last action, I will take my first step by moving left to position (row=4, col=2) where there is another box. This will allow for the possibility of a future push either direction towards a hole.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this action will help in rearranging the boxes conveniently for the subsequent move.",
