    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar can push boxes.\n*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** The avatar cannot move through walls.\n*   **Strategic Box Placement:** Boxes must be pushed into holes.\n\n**Objective:** Eliminate all boxes from the level.\n\n**Win Condition:** No boxes remain on the level (SpriteCounter box limit=0 win=True).\n\n**Loss Condition:** (Not explicitly stated, but implied) Getting stuck and being unable to move any remaining boxes.\n\n**Sprite Breakdown:**\n\n*   `floor`: The walkable area.\n*   `hole`: The target destination for boxes.\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character.\n*   `box`: The movable objects you need to get rid of.\n*   `wall`: Impassable barriers.\n\n**Interaction Breakdown:**\n\n*   `avatar wall > stepBack`: The avatar cannot move through walls. If the avatar tries to walk into a wall, it moves backwards.\n*   `box avatar > bounceForward`: The avatar pushes a box forward.\n*   `box wall box > undoAll`: If a box is pushed between a wall and another box, it's an illegal move that will undo all actions. This is a key piece of information!\n*   `box hole > killSprite scoreChange=1`: When a box is pushed into a hole, the box disappears, and the player probably gets a point.\n\n**Level Layout Analysis:**\n\n*   The level layout gives us a starting position and some hints about level design.\n*   `w` probably represents `wall`\n*   `.` probably represents `floor`\n*   `0` probably represents `box`\n*   `A` probably represents `avatar`\n*   `1` probably represents `hole`\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Accessible Boxes:** Focus on moving boxes that are not blocked by other boxes or walls.\n2.  **Plan Ahead:** Think several moves in advance to avoid creating unsolvable situations.\n3.  **Avoid Corners:** Be careful not to push boxes into corners where they can become permanently trapped.\n4.  **Utilize Walls Wisely:** Use walls as leverage points to maneuver boxes. But also be aware of the `box wall box > undoAll` which prevents you from sandwiching the box between a wall and another box.\n5.  **Hole Placement:** Exploit the positions of the holes to set up efficient box disposal routes.\n\n**In summary,** this is a Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player needs to push boxes into holes to eliminate them and win. Careful planning and spatial reasoning are crucial for success. The `box wall box` interaction is particularly interesting and makes the game less trivial.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> a\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> 0\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",
