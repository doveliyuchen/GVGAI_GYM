    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the description provided, the game can be analyzed in several key aspects:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game falls under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. It involves a player-controlled character navigating through a level to achieve specific objectives while interacting with various elements in the environment.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are several types of sprites:\n   - **Floor**: Serves as the ground where the avatar moves.\n   - **Hole**: Acts as a trap; if a box falls into it, points are gained.\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be pushed/bounced by the avatar.\n   - **Wall**: A barrier that the avatar cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - When the avatar collides with a wall, it steps back, preventing movement through the wall.\n   - When the avatar bumps into a box, it now pushes the box back into the level.\n   - Bumping a box against a wall causes the box to return to its previous position.\n   - If a box falls into a hole, the player gains points and the box is removed from play.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to manipulate the boxes to lead them into holes, achieving a state where no boxes are left on the board (SpriteCounter for the box type reaching zero).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no boxes left on the board (SpriteCounter limit for boxes is 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: Not explicitly stated, but players can infer they should avoid potentially negative outcomes (like blocking themselves or failing to use boxes effectively).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before moving, look at the layout and visualize where each box needs to go to get into a hole.\n2. **Use Wall Boundaries**: The walls can be leveraged to redirect the boxes efficiently. Move the avatar wisely to either push boxes or step back without getting stuck.\n3. **Optimal Box Handling**: Prioritize making moves that bring boxes closer to holes, while also considering how each interaction with a box affects its current position.\n4. **Avoid Box Blocking**: Be cautious not to trap boxes in such a way that makes them inaccessible. Maintain a pathway when pushing or bouncing boxes.\n5. **Iterate and Adapt**: Don\u2019t hesitate to backtrack (using the bounce mechanic thoughtfully) to reevaluate your strategy if the current approach doesn\u2019t seem to work.\n\nUsing these strategies effectively and understanding the layout will enhance the chances of achieving the objective and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> 0\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> a\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",
