    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:**  Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The core mechanic seems to be pushing boxes around.\n*   **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar that can move.\n*   **Obstacle Avoidance:**  The avatar can't move through walls.\n*   **Box Destruction:** Boxes can be destroyed if they fall into holes.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary objective is to get rid of all the boxes in the level by pushing them into holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** The player wins when there are no more boxes left on the level.\n*   **Loss:** There is no explicit loss condition mentioned but if the player gets the boxes stuck in a place where the player cannot push them into the holes the player loses.\n\n**Sprite Definitions:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player-controlled character. Can move freely unless blocked.\n*   **Box:** A pushable object.\n*   **Wall:** An impassable barrier.\n*   **Floor:** The walkable area.\n*   **Hole:**  A destination for boxes; destroys them and awards points when a box is pushed into it.\n\n**Interaction Rules:**\n\n*   **Avatar-Wall:** The avatar cannot move through the wall.\n*   **Box-Avatar:** Avatar can push the box.\n*   **Box-Wall-Box:** If two boxes are pushed into a wall at the same time, undo the move.\n*   **Box-Hole:** Box is destroyed and the player probably gets a point.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Represents walls.\n*   `.`: Represents the floor.\n*   `0`, `1`: Represents boxes.\n*   `A`: Represents the starting position of the avatar.\n\n**General Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Think several moves in advance. Pushing a box into the wrong place can create an unsolvable situation.\n2.  **Hole Prioritization:** Identify the holes and plan the box routes to them.\n3.  **Avoid Corners:** Be careful about pushing boxes into corners, as this can make them impossible to move later.\n4.  **Undoing:** If you misplace boxes against a wall undo the move.\n5.  **Spatial Awareness:** Consider the entire level layout when making moves. Think about how one move might affect future options.\n6.  **Experimentation:** Don't be afraid to experiment, but be prepared to undo moves if they don't work out.\n\nIn short, it's a Sokoban-like puzzle game where you push boxes into holes to clear the level. Planning and spatial reasoning are key to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> a\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> 0\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",
