    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n**Game Analysis:**\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game can be classified as a puzzle platformer. It combines elements of strategy and logic where the player must navigate through a level to achieve a specific objective while interacting with various game elements.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** Represents walkable ground.\n   - **Hole:** An impassable sprite that leads to character loss if interacted with a box.\n   - **Avatar (Player Character):** The main character controlled by the player, capable of movement.\n   - **Box:** An obstacle that can be moved or interacted with.\n   - **Wall:** Acts as an impassable barrier that stop the avatar and boxes.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can step back if it runs into a wall, preventing movement through walls.\n   - If the avatar collides with a box, it causes the box to bounce forward; enabling puzzle manipulation.\n   - If boxes collide with walls, they revert to their previous position (undo), maintaining game state.\n   - If a box falls into a hole, the player scores points but loses the box.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to eliminate all boxes (reaching a box counter of zero) to win the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by successfully eliminating all boxes present in the level.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player does not have an explicit loss condition related to the avatar; interacting with holes will simply score points, but losing boxes is critical to win.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Movements:** Consider each interaction and its result with boxes carefully. Predict how moving the avatar will affect box positioning.\n2. **Avoid Holes:** Be cautious of box movements towards the holes, as this will remove them from play but will allow you to earn points; however, this may affect your progress towards the win condition.\n3. **Leverage Walls:** Use walls strategically to control the movement of the boxes and to prevent overshooting boxes into holes inadvertently.\n4. **Maximize Box Elimination:** Find the most efficient path to manipulate boxes so they can fall into holes. Focus on targeting groups of boxes to clear multiple at a time.\n5. **Play Responsively:** The gameplay may involve trial and error, so adapt during play to ensure you can reposition boxes effectively while accounting for their interactions with walls and holes.\n\nKeep a clear focus on the end goal of removing all boxes while navigating the level's layout through creative problem-solving.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> a\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",

    "content": "First, let's analyze the current state of the game:\n\n- The avatar (`a`) is located at (4, 1).\n- There are boxes (`@`) at positions (1, 1), (4, 4), and (5, 2).\n- The holes (`0`) that can accept boxes are located at (1, 3) and (2, 3).\n- There are walls (`w`) that cannot be crossed.\n\nGiven the main objective is to eliminate all boxes, we can focus on the boxes' interactions with holes. \n\nCurrently, the box at (1, 1) can potentially be moved into the hole at (1, 3), and the box at (5, 2) can be manipulated but must first move towards a route that can navigate around walls. The box at (4, 4) is isolated and will take more planning.\n\nTo progress strategically:\n1. Move the avatar left to (4, 0) is useless as it leads into a wall.\n2. Move the avatar right to (4, 2) allows for potential interactions with the box at (4, 4).\n3. Move the avatar up to (3, 1) allows engagement with the boxes above, particularly the one at (1, 1).\n4. Move down to (5, 1) lets the avatar possibly maneuver around to engage with boxes below.\n\nSince moving left would result in a wall blocking passage, I will try to move upwards towards (3, 1), where there's a clear path.\n\nHere's the chosen action:\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action aims to position the avatar closer to the boxes for potential further interactions while adhering to the strategy of eliminating the boxes effectively.",
