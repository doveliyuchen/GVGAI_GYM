Game Genre and Style:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game similar to Sokoban.\n\u2003\u2022 You control an avatar that moves around a confined area (the grid) with walls, free floors, boxes, and holes.\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement: You control an avatar that moves step\u2010by\u2010step in the grid. When the avatar tries to move into a wall, the \u201cstepBack\u201d interaction stops or reverses the move.\n\u2003\u2022 Pushing Boxes: When the avatar comes into contact with a box, the \u201cbox avatar > bounceForward\u201d rule makes the box move further in the direction of the push (a \u201cbounce\u201d effect). This lets you shove boxes across the board.\n\u2003\u2022 Special Interactions: There\u2019s an interesting \u201cbox wall box > undoAll\u201d rule. Although its full impact might depend on the sequence of moves, it hints that if boxes get forced together by using walls, the game might reverse your moves (possibly as a penalty or safety net against creating unwinnable configurations).\n\u2003\u2022 Box Removal: When a box enters a hole (\u201cbox hole > killSprite scoreChange=1\u201d), the box is removed from play (with a score increase). This is the core mechanic for progressing toward the win condition.\n\n3. Objective and Win Condition:\n\u2003\u2022 The primary objective is to eliminate all boxes by pushing them into holes.\n\u2003\u2022 The level is won when there are no remaining boxes on the board (SpriteCounter for boxes reaching 0).\n\n4. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Think ahead and plan your moves carefully as it\u2019s easy to accidentally block a box where it can\u2019t reach a hole.\n\u2003\u2022 Coordinates are key: move your avatar so that each push sends a box directly or indirectly toward a hole.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the \u201cbounceForward\u201d mechanic to your advantage; a well-timed push might slide a box through a series of open spaces.\n\u2003\u2022 Be cautious with moves that risk creating a chain reaction (as indicated by the \u201cundoAll\u201d rule) which might reverse progress if boxes get jammed against each other or walls.\n\u2003\u2022 If the game offers an \u201cundo\u201d feature (implied by the possibility to \u201cundoAll\u201d), don\u2019t hesitate to backtrack when a planned sequence leads to a blocked or impossible situation.\n\nIn summary, this is a classic push-block puzzle game where the challenge is to methodically and strategically move boxes to their destinations (holes) while avoiding configurations that force you to redo moves. Steady, careful planning and attention to the interactions between boxes, walls, and the avatar are the keys to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> a\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w",
