Players control an avatar navigating a grid-based layout, interacting with different elements to achieve specific objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game consists of various sprites (objects) like water, land, fire, bombs, whirlpools, treasure, and a goal. Each has unique properties and interactions. \n2. **Interactions:** The avatar can collect resources (sand) and interact with other sprites in specific ways to achieve goals or acquire items (e.g., transforming water into land, creating fire from bombs, and collecting treasure).\n3. **Resource Management:** Players must manage sand resources carefully\u2014collecting sand from specific interactions and utilizing it strategically to progress through levels.\n4. **Transformations:** Several sprites can transform to other states (e.g., water turning into land, sand being used to create more land).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, collect treasure for points, and reach the goal specified in the level layout while ensuring the avatar remains alive. The player wins when the goal sprite count reaches zero, indicating the goal has been reached, and scores points by collecting treasures.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The player wins if the goal sprite (goal) is eliminated (count reaches 0).\n- **Loss:** The player loses if:\n  - The avatar sprite (avatar) is eliminated (count reaches 0).\n  - The timeout limit is reached (1000 units of time).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Resource Collection:** Focus on collecting sand as soon as possible since it's needed for several interactions. \n2. **Careful Navigation:** Avoid whirlpools and fire sprites, as they can instantly eliminate the avatar. Plan pathways to avoid these dangerous sprite interactions.\n3. **Use of Bombs:** Use bombs efficiently. They can be transformed into sparks that can initiate fire creation or other interactions that might clear obstacles or create new paths.\n4. **Strategic Water Usage:** Manage water carefully to change land states and create more viable pathways. Converting water to land can help avoid dangerous water interactions.\n5. **Treasure Acquisition:** Actively seek out and collect treasure to maximize points. Ensure the avatar's safety while doing so by navigating carefully around hazards.\n6. **Reach the Goal:** Determine the shortest effective path to the goal while balancing resource management. Use collected sand and transformed elements to your advantage to facilitate reaching the goal.\n\nThe layout presents some obstacles (e.g., bombs and walls) and opportunities (sand and treasure). Analyzing the layout for the most efficient route to achieve the goals while collecting resources will be key to success in this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater -> '.'\nlandSand -> 'x'\nwater bomb -> 'b'\nwater whirlpool -> 'p'\nlandSand treasure -> 't'\nlandSand goal -> 'g'\nbomb water -> '@'\ngoal landSand -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> #\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> x\nrow=1, col=13 -> x\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> x\nrow=2, col=6 -> x\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> x\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> x\nrow=2, col=13 -> x\nrow=2, col=14 -> x\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=0 -> .\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> x\nrow=3, col=5 -> x\nrow=3, col=6 -> x\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> x\nrow=3, col=13 -> x\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> x\nrow=4, col=4 -> x\nrow=4, col=5 -> x\nrow=4, col=6 -> x\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> t\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> x\nrow=4, col=13 -> x\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=0 -> .\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> x\nrow=5, col=3 -> x\nrow=5, col=4 -> x\nrow=5, col=5 -> x\nrow=5, col=6 -> x\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> x\nrow=5, col=12 -> x\nrow=5, col=13 -> x\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> x\nrow=6, col=4 -> x\nrow=6, col=5 -> x\nrow=6, col=6 -> x\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> x\nrow=6, col=11 -> x\nrow=6, col=12 -> x\nrow=6, col=13 -> x\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=0 -> .\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> x\nrow=7, col=9 -> x\nrow=7, col=10 -> x\nrow=7, col=11 -> x\nrow=7, col=12 -> x\nrow=7, col=13 -> x\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> @\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=0 -> .\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> x\nrow=9, col=11 -> a\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .",

The immediate strategy focuses on moving towards the goal located at (row=0, col=2) while avoiding dangerous sprites, effectively managing resources, and collecting treasures along the way.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar can only directly interact with safe sprites to avoid being eliminated. \n- The goal is at the top left corner of the map, while the nearest treasure is at (row=4, col=9). \n- However, the avatar needs to make sure there's a viable path to avoid whirlpools ('p') and bombs ('@'), which do not seem to pose an immediate threat in the current vicinity.\n- The ground beneath the avatar is empty ('.'), allowing for movement.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nFrom the current position (row=9, col=11), moving **up** to (row=8, col=11) seems like a sound initial action since there are no hazards there, leading closer to the treasures and ultimately the goal.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action should not only lead the avatar up one space but also keep it safe, aligning well with the established strategy of careful navigation while aiming to collect resources and reach the goal efficiently. After executing, the state will need to be reevaluated for the next move based on the new position.",
