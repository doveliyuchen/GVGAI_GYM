The use of sprites and immovable objects suggests a grid-based movement system typical of older arcade-style games.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game includes various sprites such as the avatar (the player character), traps, exit doors, and collectibles (chips).\n   - Environmental hazards include ice and fire which interact with the avatar based on the footwear the player has.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player must navigate through the level while avoiding traps (which result in a score loss).\n   - Chips (collectibles) and the exit must be reached to score points and finish levels.\n   - Feetwear provides significant strategic choices that impact the avatar's survival, as each type protects against specific hazards (ice and fire).\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar runs out of time (500 units) or the avatar is eliminated.\n   - The player wins by reaching the exit (with successful score changes) or by collecting all specific items.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level to collect chips, reach the exit, and avoid traps. Additionally, obtaining the correct footwear is crucial for surviving environmental hazards (fire and ice).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - Reach the exit before the timeout limit or while ensuring the avatar is not eliminated.\n  - Collectible items (chips) add to the score and can contribute to winning by building a more significant score.\n\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - Running out of time.\n  - The avatar being eliminated by interacting with traps or by having insufficient resources (i.e., not having the correct footwear when encountering ice or fire).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize finding and collecting the correct feetwear (iceshoes and fireboots) as they allow the avatar to navigate hazardous areas safely.\n   \n2. **Exploration:**\n   - Methodically explore the environment to locate all chips while keeping track of potential hazards. Maps may contain safe paths with hidden items.\n   \n3. **Timing:**\n   - Keep an eye on the time limit. Make sure to formulate a plan that allows for efficient movement, ideally in the early game while you gather resources.\n\n4. **Hazard Avoidance:**\n   - If you do not have the necessary footwear, avoid sections covered in ice or fire. Plan your path to ensure you\u2019re not trapped between hazards and walls.\n\n5. **Scoring:**\n   - Balance between collecting chips for points and reaching the exit; the latter must happen to ensure a win condition. A game-winning strategy could involve collecting a sufficient number of chips before heading towards the exit.\n\n6. **Use the Terrain:**\n   - The level's structure \u2014 walls, traps, and pathways \u2014 can be used to navigate safely, avoiding areas that accumulate too many hazards or block paths to collected items.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of successfully completing levels while avoiding the pitfalls of traps and hazards present in the environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nchip -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nfire -> '$'\nfireboots -> '%'\nice -> '&'\niceshoes -> '*'\ntrap -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=0, col=12 -> e\nrow=0, col=13 -> e\nrow=0, col=14 -> e\nrow=0, col=15 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> e\nrow=1, col=5 -> e\nrow=1, col=6 -> e\nrow=1, col=7 -> e\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=12 -> e\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> c\nrow=2, col=3 -> c\nrow=2, col=4 -> c\nrow=2, col=5 -> c\nrow=2, col=6 -> e\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> e\nrow=2, col=13 -> e\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> &\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> e\nrow=4, col=2 -> e\nrow=4, col=3 -> e\nrow=4, col=4 -> e\nrow=4, col=5 -> e\nrow=4, col=6 -> e\nrow=4, col=7 -> e\nrow=4, col=8 -> e\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> e\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=12 -> e\nrow=4, col=13 -> e\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> e\nrow=5, col=5 -> e\nrow=5, col=6 -> e\nrow=5, col=7 -> e\nrow=5, col=8 -> e\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> e\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=12 -> e\nrow=5, col=13 -> e\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> e\nrow=6, col=13 -> e\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> c\nrow=7, col=2 -> e\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> e\nrow=7, col=5 -> e\nrow=7, col=6 -> e\nrow=7, col=7 -> e\nrow=7, col=8 -> e\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> e\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> @\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> e\nrow=8, col=5 -> e\nrow=8, col=6 -> e\nrow=8, col=7 -> e\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=12 -> e\nrow=8, col=13 -> e\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> e\nrow=9, col=4 -> e\nrow=9, col=5 -> a\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=10 -> e\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=12 -> e\nrow=9, col=13 -> e\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=12 -> e\nrow=10, col=13 -> e\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> e\nrow=11, col=0 -> e\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> e\nrow=11, col=3 -> e\nrow=11, col=4 -> e\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> e\nrow=11, col=7 -> e\nrow=11, col=8 -> e\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> e\nrow=11, col=11 -> e\nrow=11, col=12 -> e\nrow=11, col=13 -> e\nrow=11, col=14 -> e\nrow=11, col=15 -> e\nrow=12, col=0 -> e\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> e\nrow=13, col=0 -> e\nrow=13, col=1 -> e\nrow=13, col=2 -> e\nrow=13, col=3 -> e\nrow=13, col=4 -> e\nrow=13, col=5 -> e\nrow=13, col=6 -> e\nrow=13, col=7 -> e\nrow=13, col=8 -> e\nrow=13, col=9 -> e\nrow=13, col=10 -> e\nrow=13, col=11 -> e\nrow=13, col=12 -> e\nrow=13, col=13 -> e\nrow=13, col=14 -> e\nrow=13, col=15 -> e",
