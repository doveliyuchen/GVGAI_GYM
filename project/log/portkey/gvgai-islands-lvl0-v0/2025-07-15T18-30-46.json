    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here is an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fall under the puzzle-platformer genre. The player must manipulate the environment and interact with various sprites to progress toward a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features various types of sprites, including immovable objects (water, land, whirlpool, etc.), the player avatar, and collectible resources (sand and treasure).\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can collect sand and treasure, transform water into land, and interact with fire, walls, and other elements to either progress or face consequences (like losing health or being killed).\n- **Resource Management**: The player collects sand, which can be used to spawn new elements (landSand) and accomplish objectives.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the **goal** sprite while collecting treasure and managing resources such as sand. Players must navigate the environment, avoiding obstacles, dangers like fire, whirlpools, and managing their interaction with water and land.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the avatar. The game also ends when there are no goal sprites left.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed (by fire, whirlpool, or running out of resources) or if the game times out (after 1000 units of time).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Collection**: Focus on collecting sand early in the game. This resource is pivotal for altering land and enabling further interactions.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of whirlpools and fire, as they can instantly kill your avatar.\n3. **Utilize Water Wisely**: Water can be transformed into land, creating platforms, but using it when the player has sufficient sand is essential to avoid losing resources. Manage your water interactions carefully.\n4. **Build Land**: Use the shovel on sand to create more land as needed. Keep enough sand on hand to ensure that you can navigate through the level without backtracking unnecessarily.\n5. **Plan your Route**: Analyze the layout before moving to anticipate where the goal and treasure can be accessed. Prioritize moving toward the goal sprite while collecting treasure when possible for score bonuses.\n6. **Timing and Movement**: Be mindful of the 1000 time limit. Maintain a steady pace and move efficiently through the level, executing actions like digging and transforming land quickly and strategically.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the challenges presented in the game and work towards achieving their objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater -> '.'\nlandSand -> 'x'\nwater bomb -> 'b'\nwater whirlpool -> 'p'\nlandSand treasure -> 't'\nlandSand goal -> 'g'\nbomb water -> '@'\ngoal landSand -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> t\nrow=0, col=2 -> x\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> x\nrow=1, col=1 -> x\nrow=1, col=2 -> x\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> x\nrow=2, col=7 -> x\nrow=2, col=8 -> x\nrow=2, col=9 -> x\nrow=2, col=10 -> x\nrow=2, col=11 -> x\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=0 -> .\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> x\nrow=3, col=5 -> x\nrow=3, col=6 -> x\nrow=3, col=7 -> x\nrow=3, col=8 -> x\nrow=3, col=9 -> x\nrow=3, col=10 -> x\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> x\nrow=4, col=6 -> x\nrow=4, col=7 -> x\nrow=4, col=8 -> x\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=0 -> .\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> x\nrow=5, col=8 -> x\nrow=5, col=9 -> x\nrow=5, col=10 -> x\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> x\nrow=6, col=7 -> x\nrow=6, col=8 -> x\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=0 -> .\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> x\nrow=7, col=6 -> x\nrow=7, col=7 -> x\nrow=7, col=8 -> a\nrow=7, col=9 -> x\nrow=7, col=10 -> x\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> p\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> x\nrow=9, col=0 -> .\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> x\nrow=9, col=15 -> x",

    "content": "Given the current state, your avatar 'a' is located at (7, 8) and the goal sprite '#' is at (8, 14). The player also has to be cautious of the whirlpool 'p' which is at (8, 3).\n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n1. **Position of Collectibles and Hazards**:\n   - There are treasures and landSand around, but the main focus should be on reaching the goal at (8, 14).\n   - The whirlpool at (8, 3) poses a danger, but it is far enough from our current position that it won't directly affect our immediate next moves.\n   - Directly below the avatar, at (8, 8), there are no hazards blocking the way toward the goal.\n\n2. **Next Move**: \n   - The goal is in row 8, so moving down to (8, 8) could potentially allow access to the right which might lead toward the goal.\n   - Furthermore, checking the neighboring spaces would help in assessing if I can reach the goal quickly.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move **downwards** to (8, 8) to align myself closer to the row of the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis move should place my avatar directly in line for future movement towards the goal. I expect to see if there are any immediate hazards or new collectibles in the next state that affect my path to the goal.",
