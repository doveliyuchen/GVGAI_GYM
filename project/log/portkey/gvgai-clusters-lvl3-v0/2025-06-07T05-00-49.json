The rules and mechanics suggest a focus on spatial reasoning and strategic planning as the player navigates through the levels, interacts with different blocks, and manipulates their environment to achieve objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- The player controls an \"avatar\" (likely a character or player icon) that can move left, right, and possibly jump.\n- The game features various types of \"blocks\" and \"boxes,\" which are immovable or movable elements the player can interact with.\n- Some blocks can change state (e.g., bluebox can transform into blueblock upon interaction), while others may cause damage or negative effects (e.g., falling into a \"hole\").\n- Interaction mechanics involve pushing blocks or boxes to create pathways, while also sometimes causing them to be eliminated or transformed.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to eliminate all the \"boxes.\" The game ends successfully when there are no boxes left, which suggests a level of strategy in how the player decides to manipulate the blocks to achieve this end.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- The player wins if the count of \"box\" sprites reaches zero.\n- The player loses if:\n  - The avatar\u2019s count reaches zero (likely due to falling into holes or being trapped).\n  - A \"brokenBox\" appears on the board.\n  - The player fails to complete the level within a certain time limit (1500 ticks).\n  \n**Level Layout:**  \nThe provided layout shows:\n- Walls (represented by 'w') that confine movement.\n- Open spaces (represented by '.') where the player can navigate.\n- Numbered blocks (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the character 'a' representing the avatar.\n- Holes ('h') that cause the avatar to lose.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Identify locations of holes, walls, and where boxes are situated. This helps in planning your moves strategically.\n\n2. **Box Interactions:** Focus on how the boxes and blocks interact. Use the avatar to push boxes into holes or other blocks that can cause transformations. Aim to create combinations to eliminate multiple boxes in one move.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes:** Be cautious around holes. Plan your movements to avoid falling in, as this will lead to a loss of the avatar and potentially a level reset.\n\n4. **Utilize Transformations:** Take advantage of transforming boxes into different states to simplify your interactions. This can help in clearing the playing field more effectively.\n\n5. **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the timer. Since there is a limit, work efficiently to ensure you can eliminate all boxes before time runs out.\n\n6. **Undo Movements Wisely:** Utilize the \"undo\" mechanics strategically to restore previous positions and reset blocks when you find your moves lead to unfavorable outcomes.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, you will optimize your chances of success in the game and enhance your overall gameplay experience.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is located at (5, 4). \n\nFrom the map:\n- There are holes at (4, 9), (5, 5), and (5, 6), which are dangerous as falling into them will result in a loss of the avatar.\n- There is a blue box ('#') at (2, 4) that can be moved.\n- There are other boxes and blocks scattered throughout the layout.\n\nSince your current position (5, 4) places you adjacent to a hole, it's crucial to be cautious with your next move. The best action right now would be to move **LEFT (2)** to (5, 3), which is safe and keeps you away from the holes while also keeping options open for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```  \nThis action should keep the avatar safe and allow further planning to eliminate boxes effectively.",
