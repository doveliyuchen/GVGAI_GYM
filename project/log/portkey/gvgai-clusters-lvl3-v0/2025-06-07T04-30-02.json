Key sprites include:\n  - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n  - **Blocks/Boxes**: These can bounce the avatar forward or transform into different types (color-based) when certain interactions occur.\n  - **Walls and Holes**: The walls are impassable, causing the avatar to step back when collided with. Holes act as hazards that kill the avatar and score negatively.\n- **Transformations**: Boxes can transform into blocks upon interaction, creating a mechanic where strategy involves planning how to utilize the boxes effectively.\n- **Undo Mechanic**: Certain interactions can revert the state of blocks back to their previous form, adding a strategic layer to player decisions.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to eliminate all boxes to win (SpriteCounter for boxes must reach a limit of zero). Maintaining a positive score and avoiding avatar death are implicit objectives as well.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when no boxes remain on the board.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit reaches zero), a broken box (which is negative) persists, or the player runs out of time (timeout limit reached).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Moves**: Since interactions can lead to both transformations and negative consequences (like the avatar dying), careful planning of moves is essential. Look at the layout to predict how boxes can be manipulated into blocks effectively.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Box Elimination**: Focus on interacting with boxes to transform them into blocks or to use them to help get rid of other blocks. Understand which box colors correspond to the blocks for conversion.\n  \n3. **Watch Out for Hazards**: Always be mindful of the holes on the board. Avoid getting too close or making moves that lead to the avatar falling into one.\n\n4. **Use Undo Wisely**: Take advantage of the undo feature to revert poor decisions or prevent losing a box/block interaction that could detrimentally affect your progress.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Pay attention to the time limits and prioritize actions that can efficiently create opportunities to eliminate boxes before time runs out.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can navigate the game's levels more efficiently and increase their chances of winning.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
