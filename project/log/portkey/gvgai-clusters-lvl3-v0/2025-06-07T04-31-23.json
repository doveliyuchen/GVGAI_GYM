Players control an avatar (the protagonist) navigating through a series of obstacles (walls, boxes, blocks) while solving puzzles to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of immovable and movable sprites (e.g., walls, blocks, boxes) make up the game's environment. Key sprites include:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes and Blocks**: Used to solve puzzles. They can transform into different types (e.g., bluebox to blueblock) depending on the interaction with other boxes/blocks.\n   - **Holes**: Represent danger; falling into one results in a loss, represented by the avatar being \"killed.\"\n   - **Floor and Walls**: Act as boundaries within the game space.\n\n2. **Interactions**: Various interactions determine how sprites behave when they come into contact:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, but stepping against walls and holes has detrimental outcomes.\n   - Boxes can be transformed, and certain combinations of boxes can undo previous actions.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**: \n   - The game ends in a win if all boxes are collected (SpriteCounter for boxes is at 0).\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar's counter reaches 0 (the avatar dies) or if the player runs out of time.\n\n### Objective\nThe goal is to successfully transform and manipulate boxes such that all boxes on the screen can be cleared (reaching a count of zero boxes) before the avatar runs out of lives or time. Players must navigate the level while avoiding hazards (like holes).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win:**\n  - All boxes are removed from play (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n- **Loss:**\n  - The avatar is \"killed\" by falling into a hole (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n  - An unwanted condition occurs when a broken box is present (limit of broken boxes is exceeded).\n  - The time limit (1500) is reached without achieving the objective.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Safe Navigation**: Always be cautious near holes. Plan your path to avoid falling in.\n2. **Box Interaction**: Use available boxes wisely. Experiment with transforming boxes to clear the path and ensure that they do not revert to a disadvantageous state. Combining the right colored boxes can lead to necessary transformations.\n3. **Focus on Outmaneuvering Obstacles**: Since walls impede movement, know when to step back and reassess routes.\n4. **Watch the Timer**: Monitor the time limit carefully; ensure you make progress without getting stuck in areas where interactions do not yield productive results.\n5. **Clear Sections Methodically**: Work through sections of the level systematically, aiming to clear boxes layer by layer while making sure there are ways to access all boxes.\n6. **Undo Mechanism Management**: Be aware of the interactions that can result in undoing your progress. Plan ahead to avoid creating scenarios where your moves become counterproductive.\n\nThe key to effectively completing the game lies in careful planning around the movement and transformation of boxes, avoiding immediate hazards, and maintaining awareness of the available time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> a\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
