Players control an avatar navigating a grid-like environment filled with blocks and obstacles, requiring strategic movement and interactions.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various immovable and movable sprites such as walls, blocks, boxes, holes, and the avatar.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar interacts with other sprites in specific ways, determining the outcome (e.g., bouncing off boxes, stepping back from walls, transforming boxes into blocks).\n- **Sprite Types**: Different types of blocks (blue, red, green) can transform into their respective block types upon interactions. Boxes can bounce the avatar forward or become broken if they fall into holes.\n  \n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all the boxes from the level while keeping the avatar alive. This is achieved by performing interactions that promote the transformation or movement of boxes without getting them into the holes until the player's strategy is directly aimed at clearing the level. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win**: The player wins the game if they manage to eliminate all boxes from the level (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0), if a broken box exists (MultiSpriteCounter for broken boxes reaches 1), or if a timeout occurs (1500 units of time).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify where the boxes and holes are situated and how they can be manipulated.\n  \n2. **Manage Inventory of Blocks**: Focus on transforming boxes into blocks wisely and control when this happens. Try to manipulate them for strategic positioning (i.e., so they can bounce the avatar safely).\n\n3. **Plan Interactions**: Make sequential moves that will lead to the breaking or movement of the boxes towards holes. Interacting with different colored blocks strategically is essential as some combinations will cause \"undoing\" of actions, which wastes moves.\n\n4. **Avoiding Holes**: Always be mindful of the holes. Never leave the avatar in a position where it can easily fall into a hole or be pushed into one through interactions.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Speed up your thinking to plan out moves without causing delays that could lead to losses on the timer. The more quickly you can eliminate boxes, the less risk you have overall.\n\nBy employing these strategies and learning from interactions over time, players can successfully navigate levels, eliminate boxes, and win without losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> a\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> #\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

The surrounding spaces have various blocks and obstacles:\n\n- Directly above the avatar at (5, 6) is empty space ('.'), which indicates I can move there.\n- To the left (6, 5) and right (6, 7) are also empty spaces.\n- Below (7, 6) is again empty space.\n\nThe goal is to strategically interact with the boxes and eliminate them while avoiding the holes. My immediate options are to move up, down, left, or right, but I need to ensure I don't get my avatar in a position where they can fall into one of the holes below.\n\nConsidering the overall strategy and current layout:\n- Moving up (to (5, 6)) seems a safe next action, as it keeps me moving without risking falling into any holes, and it allows me to assess the situation from above where I can see more tiles.\n\nTherefore, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI expect this move to align with the strategy of keeping my avatar safe while I reevaluate my next steps from a higher position.",
