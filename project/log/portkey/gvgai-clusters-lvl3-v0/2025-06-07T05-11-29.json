    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer. It combines elements of logic-based puzzles with platforming mechanics, where players must navigate through the environment and strategically interact with various sprites to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game features several different kinds of sprites (floor, walls, blocks, boxes, and an avatar) that interact with each other in unique ways.\n- **Movement:** The player controls an avatar that moves through a grid-like environment. The avatar bounces off certain objects and can only step back against walls.\n- **Transformations:** Players can transform boxes into colored blocks, which can then be stacked or further manipulated to achieve objectives.\n- **Score Changes:** Some interactions lead to positive (score increase) or negative outcomes (score decrease) based on the player's actions.\n  \n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to clear the level of boxes. The player must manipulate the blocks, using the boxes, in order to achieve this goal. The specific goal is to transform boxes and interact with them to meet the requirement of having zero boxes left on the screen.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the number of boxes (SpriteCounter for `box`) reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if:\n  - The avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for `avatar` hits zero).\n  - A broken box (MultiSpriteCounter for `brokenBox`) exists at the end of the level.\n  - A timeout occurs after 1500 ticks.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Prioritize planning your moves ahead, as stepping back against walls or making unproductive interactions can result in losing valuable moves or time.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:** You need to bounce boxes into the right positions to transform them into blocks that can help you clear more spaces. Each type of box has specific transformations with colored blocks that should be strategically used to maximize score.\n\n3. **Clear Obstacles:** Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls, holes, or blocks that make your avatar step back. Instead, look for opportunities where boxes can be used to bounce into obstacles.\n\n4. **Focus on Transforming Boxes:** Successfully transforming boxes into broken boxes is essential for reducing the total box count; hence, select the correct color combinations to achieve this goal effectively.\n\n5. **Avoid Creating Broken Boxes:** Ensure that your actions do not inadvertently create broken boxes, as this will lead to a loss condition. Manage your interactions wisely to prevent an unfavorable outcome.\n\n6. **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the tick counter. Be efficient in your movements and aim for a route that minimizes the number of moves needed to clear the boxes.\n\n7. **Experiment with Interactions:** The game has several unique interactions; experimenting in a calculated manner can yield creative solutions to stubborn box configurations.\n\nBy following these strategies and maintaining a solid understanding of the game mechanics, players can better navigate challenges and successfully complete the levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> a\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "In the current game state, the avatar ('a') is located at (4, 7). The objective is to eliminate boxes, and I currently see the following relevant items in the environment:\n\n- A blue box ('#') at (2, 4).\n- A red box ('b') at (4, 8).\n- A green box ('%') at (3, 6).\n- A broken box ('*') at (7, 9).\n\nThe strategy involves moving towards boxes to interact with them for transformations while being wary of the broken box at (7, 9) to avoid a loss condition.\n\nGiven that the avatar's current position (4, 7) means it is adjacent to the red box at (4, 8), I can take action to move to the right to interact with that box. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to engage with the red box, which is crucial in the plan to clear boxes from the screen and reduce the overall box count.
