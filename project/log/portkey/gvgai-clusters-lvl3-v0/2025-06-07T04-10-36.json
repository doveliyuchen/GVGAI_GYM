Players navigate through a grid-based layout while interacting with various sprites (blocks, boxes, walls, and hazards) to achieve specific objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game includes immovable sprites (like walls and floors), passive sprites (like boxes), and movable avatars (controlled by the player). \n- **Interactions:** The player\u2019s avatar can interact with other sprites in specific ways. For example, stepping back upon encountering walls, losing points when falling into holes, bouncing from boxes, and transforming boxes into different types of blocks which can provide score benefits.\n- **Sprite Types:** There are various block types (blue, red, green) that can transform into one another and impact gameplay. The interaction between boxes and blocks allows for strategizing around points and movements.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe primary goal is to eliminate all the boxes (sprite counter for boxes reaching zero) while avoiding falling into holes, ensuring that the player\u2019s avatar survives. The game penalizes for making poor decisions (falling into holes, running out of moves, etc.).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if all boxes are transformed or removed before running out of them. \n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is eliminated due to falling into a hole, if the timer runs out, or if there\u2019s a failure to clear boxes.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Movements:** Before executing any moves, consider how each interaction affects both the avatar and the boxes. Look for ways to bounce off boxes to navigate the level effectively without hitting walls.\n\n2. **Transform Blocks Smartly:** Focus on transforming boxes into the corresponding block type for scoring points. Prioritize transforming boxes to maximize point gain while clearing the path for progress.\n\n3. **Manage Space Wisely:** Utilize the spaces between blocks and holes effectively to avoid getting stuck or boxed in. Always have a clear exit route planned to avoid fall hazards.\n\n4. **Conservative Approach:** Avoid unnecessary risks. Stepping back from walls and planning interactions carefully can prolong the avatar's life and make it more likely to win.\n\n5. **Monitor Time:** Keep an eye on the timer. Since running out of time leads to a loss, make sure that your decisions are time-efficient and moving towards clearing boxes quickly.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and understanding the game\u2019s mechanics, players can navigate the levels with greater efficiency and aim to achieve the objectives effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
