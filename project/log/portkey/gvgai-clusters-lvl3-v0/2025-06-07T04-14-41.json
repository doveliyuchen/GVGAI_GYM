Players are likely tasked with solving spatial puzzles while navigating a grid-like environment that includes various movable and immovable objects.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various sprites, including immovable walls, holes that result in player death, blocks that can transform into other blocks, and an avatar which is the player's character. \n- **Interactions:** The mechanics involve the avatar interacting with different types of blocks and boxes. Each interaction has specific outcomes \u2014 for example, some blocks can transform when combined, certain blocks push the avatar back, and boxes can bounce the avatar forward. \n- **Movement:** There is an emphasis on strategic movement, as stepping back is frequent in interactions with walls and blocks.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary goal is to clear the level by transforming boxes into blocks until all boxes are gone (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0). \n- Additionally, if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0) or if broken boxes appear without successful transformation, the player loses.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  1. All boxes must be transformed and removed from the level.\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  1. The avatar is eliminated (i.e., stepping onto a hole).\n  2. A broken box appears when a box falls into a hole.\n  3. The game times out (1500 units of time).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Movement Carefully:**\n   - Pay attention to your position relative to walls and holes. Avoid them to prevent instant loss.\n\n2. **Utilize Box Interactions:**\n   - Use boxes effectively to transform them into blocks. Execute combinations strategically to ensure you maximize points and facilitate removal.\n\n3. **Manage Block Transformations:**\n   - Monitor the types of blocks you are creating. It\u2019s crucial to avoid creating multiple blocks of the wrong type due to undo mechanics. \n\n4. **Avoid Infinite Loops:** \n   - Be cautious with the interactions that cause undoing transformations. Create a sequence where the interactions will lead to clearing your blocks instead of recycling them indefinitely.\n\n5. **Track Time:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer. Ensure your interactions are efficient and that you\u2019re progressing toward transforming and clearing every box before time runs out.\n\n6. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Since this is a puzzle-based game, it may require some experimentation to learn how different sprites and boxes interact. Don\u2019t hesitate to try different strategies to find one that works best.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, this game combines strategic planning and problem-solving within a 2D space. By focusing on how to manipulate boxes and manage interactions carefully, players can successfully navigate through the levels and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
