The player (controlled by the avatar) interacts with these sprites to create desired outcomes.\n- **Movement**: The player can move the avatar around the level, but encounters with walls induce a backward move, while interactions with boxes enable bouncing forward.\n- **Transformations**: Certain combinations of sprites transform into others (e.g., a bluebox can become a blueblock), indicating strategic combinations are essential.\n- **Scoring**: Players gain points by transforming blueboxes, redboxes, and greenboxes into their corresponding colored blocks.\n\n**Objectives**:  \n1. **Primary Goal**: Transform all existing boxes into blocks of the respective color until there are no remaining boxes (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n2. **Survival**: The avatar must avoid falling into holes, which results in loss of points, and ultimately leads to failure if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n3. **Avoid Broken Boxes**: The presence of a broken box appears to affect the win condition negatively; having even one leads to loss (MultiSpriteCounter for brokenBoxes).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win**: The player wins by reducing the number of boxes to zero (all have been transformed).\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0), or if there\u2019s a timeout (1500 units).\n- If a broken box is present at the end, the player also loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Careful Movement**: Prioritize navigation to avoid holes to prevent losing the avatar. Keeping track of each move is crucial as walls will force you back.\n\n2. **Strategic Box Use**: Focus on combining the boxes wisely:\n   - Identify which colored boxes you have and try to convert them into blocks by pairing them correctly.\n   - Remember the interactions to use boxes to your advantage\u2014using boxes as bouncers can help you navigate further or reach other blocks safely.\n\n3. **Prioritize Boxes**: Since the main win condition revolves around using up all the boxes, aim to interact with boxes to convert them while being cautious of creating broken boxes (which occur if a box falls into the hole).\n\n4. **Plan for the Environment**: Use walls and the layout to your advantage. In tight spaces, consider the setbacks caused by walls when plotting your next move or interaction.\n\n5. **Avoid Redundant Moves**: Certain interactions (like the \"undo all\" from mixing different colored boxes) can create setbacks. Avoid unnecessary combinations unless you're certain they lead to a beneficial outcome.\n\n6. **Time Management**: The game has a timeout mechanic, so keep a mental note of the time or make quick decisions to ensure you maximize your moves before time runs out.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the puzzle and work toward completing their objectives while minimizing their chances of loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> a\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game where my avatar is located at (6, 6), I need to consider my next move with care to avoid falling into holes and to transform available boxes:\n\n1. The nearby sprites include a **bluebox** at (2, 5), two **redboxes** at (2, 6) and (4, 8), and some **greenboxes** at (3, 7) and (5, 8).\n2. However, I also have to keep an eye on the walls, the holes located at (4, 9) and (5, 5), and avoid the broken boxes, which I do not currently have.\n\nTo be strategic, I see that there is a **bluebox** directly above (2, 5) and some safe ground below without holes. I should move upwards to explore and potentially interact with these boxes.\n\nConsidering all the above:\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect to navigate upwards into a safe space, potentially moving towards the box I need to transform.",
