The mechanics involve movements and interactions of various sprites as the player navigates through a structured environment.\n\n**Game Mechanics**\n- **Sprites & Interactions**: The game uses different types of sprites including the avatar (player character), blocks, boxes, walls, and holes. The avatar can move around and interacts with other sprites in specific ways, affecting their states (e.g., transforming sprites or changing their scores).\n- **Movement & Obstacles**: The avatar can move but must navigate around walls and holes which can penalize them. Collecting or using boxes is a critical part of gameplay, as they can bounce the avatar back or transform into different forms upon interaction with other blocks.\n  \n**Game Objectives**\n- **Primary Objective**: The goal of the game is to clear out a specific type of sprite referred to as \"boxes\" to win. This generally suggests manipulating the objects in the environment to reduce their count to zero.\n- **Score Management**: Interactions can also affect the player's score positively or negatively, hence managing interactions wisely is crucial.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Conditions**: The player wins by reducing the number of \"boxes\" to zero (SpriteCounter limit=0).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit=0), if a broken box exists on the screen (MultiSpriteCounter limit=1), or if a time limit is reached (timeout limit=1500).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before moving the avatar, analyze the entire level layout and determine possible interactions with boxes. Think ahead about how the movement of boxes will affect other sprites.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively**: Use the boxes to your advantage. Interact with them strategically so they can transform into blocks, help manipulate the environment, and clear out other boxes.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes & Walls**: Move carefully to avoid falling into holes which cost you points. Stepping back from walls and obstacles can give time to formulate a strategy for overcoming them.\n\n4. **Score Management**: Keep track of the score. Focus on actions that will increase your score while ensuring you do not inadvertently create broken boxes or cause the avatar to be eliminated.\n\n5. **Optimize Game Time**: Since there is a time limit, prioritize actions that will allow you to eliminate boxes quickly while being mindful of potential score penalties.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different box combinations and interactions to discover new ways to clear them out effectively.\n\nBy applying these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, you will be positioned to effectively navigate through the challenges and work towards achieving your objective of clearing all the boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, we can identify the following key points:\n\n- **Avatar Position**: The avatar is located at (row=7, col=6).\n- **Surrounding Entities**: \n  - Directly below the avatar is a hole (row=8, col=6), which is something to avoid.\n  - To the left (row=7, col=5) there is an empty space.\n  - To the right (row=7, col=7) there is an empty space.\n  - Above the avatar (row=6, col=6) there is a greenbox ($).\n  \nGiven the objective is to reduce the number of boxes to zero, my immediate action will involve moving to collect or interact with the items above or around the avatar, especially considering the greenbox which is a target to eliminate.\n\nSince I should avoid falling into holes and also recognize that my avatar has not moved and may need to rotate first if I plan to move in any direction, my first action should be to check whether moving up toward the greenbox is viable. However, since the hole is directly below me, I must ensure that if I intend to rise and collect the box, then I must also carefully evaluate movements that prevent any unnecessary risks of falling.\n\nLet's attempt to move **up** to interact with the greenbox.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis movement up should allow me to interact with the greenbox, potentially reducing the number of boxes while avoiding the hole directly below. I expect this to align with our strategy of effectively using boxes to progress towards the win condition.",
