It involves navigating through a grid-based layout while interacting with various objects to solve puzzles, acquire points, and achieve specific game objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** Various types of immovable and movable sprites exist, including walls, blocks, boxes, and the avatar. \n- **Interactions:** The game's mechanics involve interactions between the 'avatar' (player-controlled character) and other sprites:\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes and interacts negatively with holes (which lead to losing points).\n  - Different colored blocks transform into one another upon interaction with the corresponding boxes, influencing scoring.\n  - The environment features walls that the avatar cannot pass through, resulting in a step back if the avatar collides with them.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to:\n- Remove all boxes from the game (indicated by the SpriteCounter for 'box' reaching zero).\n- Accumulate points through successful transformations of boxes into blocks.\n- Avoid pitfalls such as falling into holes and not losing the avatar. Losing the avatar leads to a game over.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win:** The player wins when the number of boxes reaches zero.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if:\n  - The avatar count drops to zero.\n  - A broken box is created (indicated by a counter).\n  - A timeout occurs after 1500 movement actions.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Careful Navigation:**\n   - Keep track of the avatar's position and ensure that it doesn't fall into holes, as that results in losing points and risking a game over.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:**\n   - Use boxes strategically to create successful interactions with colored blocks. Focus on using the right colored box to yield the desired transformation for scoring.\n   - Prioritize not letting boxes interact with each other unless it results in a clear benefit, as they will undo all transformations if the wrong colors are used together.\n\n3. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Study the level layout. Identify safe zones and plan your moves to minimize the risk of falling into holes or becoming trapped by walls.\n\n4. **Pace Yourself:**\n   - Manage how quickly you make moves since time is a factor in game completion. Avoid rushing, particularly when navigating around holes and walls.\n\n5. **Transform Wisely:**\n   - Focus on maximizing score by transforming blue, red, and green boxes into their respective blocks wisely. Aim to align them such that their transformations lead to a majority of boxes being eliminated efficiently.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can optimize your gameplay, leading to successful completion of levels while maximizing scores and minimizing the risk of loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> a\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> #\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

The best immediate action is to move to the right to pick up the red box, as it can lead to useful scoring transformations.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to allow the avatar to collect the red box, enabling potential scoring transformations in future moves.",
