    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle platformer genre**. It involves navigating a level, solving puzzles, and avoiding hazards using a character (the avatar) in a grid-based environment. \n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Such as the floor, walls, and holes which pose limitations to movement.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes and Blocks**: Various types of blocks and boxes (e.g., blue, red, green) that interact in specific ways, including transformations and point scoring.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes and move back when colliding with walls or blocks.\n   - Certain boxes can transform into blocks of the same color, which contributes to scoring and possibly affects level progression.\n   - Loose boxes can be transformed into \"broken boxes\" upon falling into holes.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to eliminate all \"box\" sprites from the level. This presents itself as a puzzle to be solved through careful maneuvering and interaction with other sprites.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if all \"box\" sprites are removed from the level.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game is lost if the avatar is defeated (in this case, falling into a hole).\n   - The game also ends unfavorably if there is a timeout, or if a broken box count exceeds the limit.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Each Move**: Given that interactions are crucial to the gameplay, think several moves ahead. Every box interaction should be purposeful, either to eliminate other boxes or to prevent unwanted transformations.\n\n2. **Utilize Box Transformations Wisely**: Interactions between similar colored boxes are critical. When you have multiple box interactions happening, ensure you plan which boxes to combine to maximize your score and push others off effectively.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of holes and keep an eye on the avatar's position to prevent deaths. If you're close to a hole, consider taking a step back to reassess your next move.\n\n4. **Manage Time**: Pay attention to the time limit. Make efficient moves to ensure you complete the level before the time runs out.\n\n5. **Experiment with Configurations**: If at first a configuration doesn't work (i.e., you encounter a deadlock), backtrack using the undo interactions to restore previous states and try different approaches to eliminate boxes.\n\nBy understanding the game's mechanics, objectives, and win/loss conditions, players can develop effective strategies to navigate the level and ultimately achieve victory by removing all boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

The avatar cannot occupy the same space as a blue box, so this action is invalid.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (to 8, 3)**: This moves the avatar into an empty space (floor), which is a valid move.\n3. **ACTION_UP (to 7, 2)**: This would collide with a wall, making this action invalid.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (to 9, 2)**: This would also collide with a wall at the bottommost row, again making this action invalid.\n\nGiven the only valid option is to move right into the empty space at (8, 3), I will choose this action.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right allows the avatar to continue navigating the level and avoid collisions with walls or boxes, aligning with our strategy of making efficient moves.",
