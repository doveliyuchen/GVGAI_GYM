You'll need to collect points by defeating enemies and clearing the area.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: You win by reaching the goal.\n- **Loss Condition**: You lose if your character is killed by an enemy, wall explosion, or if the sprite counter for 'bomberman' hits zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarity**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the level layout, particularly noting potential hiding spots for enemies and areas to lay bombs where they can affect multiple targets.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement**: Utilize bombs strategically to clear walls and create openings for both escape and attack. Try to anticipate enemy movement patterns, inspiring bomb placement to catch them off guard.\n\n3. **Chain Reactions**: Focus on creating chain reactions. Hitting one bomb could lead to others detonating, potentially defeating multiple enemies at once.\n\n4. **Enemy Awareness**: Keep a safe distance from enemies until you have a plan to deal with them through bombs. Always watch their movement and think about potential bomb placements that could trap or eliminate them.\n\n5. **Avoid Damage**: Maintain a health buffer by avoiding enemy contact. Since losing the bomberman results in a game over, it's crucial to play defensively until the opportunity arises.\n\n6. **Resource Management**: Carefully manage the bombs at your disposal. Use lower-tier bombs on easy targets but save stronger bombs for tougher ones or tricky areas, preserving your chances of success throughout the level.\n\n7. **Collect Points**: Aim for bonuses by taking down enemies to increase your score, which can provide additional advantages or unlockables, enhancing your overall gaming experience.\n\nBy combining careful planning with strategic bomb placement, you can navigate the environment effectively, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach your goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'i'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> @\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> k\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> %\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar (bomberman represented as '#') is located at (2, 5). The player must strategize to eliminate enemies and ultimately reach the goal (the green door represented as '$') located at (3, 1).\n\nAnalyzing the available entities:\n- At (2, 5), the avatar is adjacent to various walls and bombs on different coordinates.\n- There are enemies (bats '@' and scorpions '%') nearby. Specifically, a bat is at (1, 14) and a scorpion is at (6, 4) and (6, 17).\n- The goal area is two rows down and several walls exist below that potentially block a direct route to it.\n\nWith the move strategy in mind:\n1. The avatar can start by examining the nearest walls and enemies for bomb placement opportunities.\n2. Positioned next to the wall at (2, 4) might not have immediate enemies in attacking range.\n3. With a bomb at 'k' (located at (2, 6)), nearby walls at (3, 3), (3, 4), etc., can be potentially cleared with bomb actions.\n\nTo make a meaningful action while adhering to the game's mechanics and enabling a response to these maps, I will: \n\n- Check the strategy to move down towards (3, 5) to potentially place a bomb next to the adjacent wall with the intent on creating chain reactions.\n\nHence, I will execute the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action aims to navigate down, looking for the strategic benefit in opening paths and dealing damage as we try approaching the goal direction. The anticipated outcome is aligning with the strategy of maximizing bomb placement opportunities while avoiding enemy threats.",
