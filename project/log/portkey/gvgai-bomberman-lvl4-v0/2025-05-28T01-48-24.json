Players must think strategically about how to move around the map, place bombs, and defeat enemies.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: The game includes several sprites: the player character (bomberman), various enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions), walls (both breakable and unbreakable), bombs, and various forms of explosions.\n- **Bombs**: The player has access to bombs that can destroy walls and enemies, create explosions, and allow for strategic gameplay by controlling the blast radius.\n- **Movement and Interactions**: The bomberman can move around the map, place bombs, and interact with walls and enemies. The objective is to reach the goal (green door) while managing enemies and obstacles.\n\n**Objective**:  \n- The primary goal is for the **bomberman** to reach the **goal** (the green door) while avoiding enemies and utilizing bombs effectively. \n- Players can earn points by defeating enemies and breaking walls and must avoid being killed by explosions or enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the number of **goal** sprites reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the number of **bomberman** sprites reaches zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout, including walls, potential enemy locations, and possible placements for bombs. Identify the positions of walls versus breakable walls to effectively plan bomb placement.\n\n2. **Avoiding Enemies**: Enemies need to be dealt with strategically. Use the environment to take cover and avoid direct encounters. If possible, lead enemies into bomb areas to defeat them safely from a distance.\n\n3. **Strategic Bomb Placement**: \n   - Place bombs where they can hit multiple targets, including enemies and walls. \n   - Be aware of the bomb healing countdown and always step back after placing a bomb to avoid damage.\n\n4. **Utilizing Explosions**: Use explosions to your advantage by positioning them to hit nearby enemies, destroy obstacles, or clear a path toward the goal.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: Keep track of the number of usable bombs (in this case, 10 types of bombs). Use them judiciously\u2014don't waste bombs on weak enemies if stronger foes or obstacles are present.\n\n6. **Securing Power-Ups**: Collect any available items that assist in reaching the goal faster or provide advantages against enemies.\n\n7. **Approach with Caution**: Always plan a few moves ahead. Since enemies can move randomly, observe their patterns and adapt your movements accordingly.\n\nOverall, the key to winning lies in effective bomb usage, avoiding enemy attacks, and smart navigation toward the goal while managing a growing threat of explosions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'i'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\nbomb_1 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'l'\nexplosionDown -> 'm'\nexplosionLeft -> 'n'\nexplosionRight -> 'o'\nexplosionUp -> 'p'\nbomb -> 'q'\nbomb explosionLeft -> 'r'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 't'\nexplosionDown explosionRight explosionUp -> 'u'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> %\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> t\nrow=2, col=6 -> u\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> s\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> %\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

Here are some highlights from the current map layout:\n\n- I am currently at position (3, 5).\n- There are walls (unbreakable '*') around me and several enemies ('@', '%', '&') on the map.\n- The goal ('$') is at position (3, 1), and there are breakable walls ('b') which can be targeted for removal.\n  \nGiven that my position hasn't changed in the last turn, I should make a meaningful action now. Evaluating potential actions:\n\n1. I could **move left to (3, 4)**, but it remains a wall.\n2. I could **move down to (4, 5)** which has a scorpion, posing a risk.\n3. I could also **move up to (2, 5)** but there seems to be an explosion item ('t') which might not be beneficial right now.\n4. Another direction is to **move right to (3, 6)**, which is open and would allow for better positioning for bomb placement around the breakable walls.\n\nI should avoid losing health due to enemies or explosions. My best option here, since the left is a wall, would be to **move right**.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right is a strategic choice to position myself closer to options for bomb placement while avoiding immediate threats. My expectation is that I will find a clearer path towards the goal.",
