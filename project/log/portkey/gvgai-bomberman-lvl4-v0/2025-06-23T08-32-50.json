Players navigate through a maze and utilize bombs strategically to eliminate enemies and reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Characters:**\n   - **BOMBERMAN:** Controlled character; places bombs.\n   - **ENEMIES (BATS, SPIDERS, SCORPIONS):** Randomly generated adversaries that players must avoid or defeat.\n   - **BLOCKS/WALLS:** Impassable barriers that can be strategically used to block enemies or direct explosions.\n   - **EXPLOSIONS:** Occur as a result of bomb placements, damaging enemies and destruction.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement:**\n   - Players can place bombs to destroy blocks and enemies.\n   - Bombs create a chain reaction of explosions.\n\n3. **Goal:**\n   - The main objective is to reach the green door ('goal') while managing your bombs and dealing with enemies.\n\n**Objective:**\nReach the green door while accumulating score points, which can be achieved by defeating enemies or breaking blocks. The player also must avoid being defeated by their own bombs or enemy attacks.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal (green door) before running out of lives (bomberman sprite limit) or getting killed.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the bomberman sprite counter reaches zero, which means the player has no lives left.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout to navigate efficiently and identify potential hiding spots and paths to the goal.\n\n2. **Bomb Management:**\n   - Place bombs strategically to eliminate walls and create paths while minimizing your own exposure to potential blasts.\n   - Be cautious of chain reactions that can backfire\u2014like one bomb triggering another.\n\n3. **Enemy Avoidance:**\n   - Keep an eye on enemy movements. Since they are random, predict their paths to avoid unnecessary confrontations.\n   - Use bombs to eliminate enemies when safe, but avoid being caught in the explosion range.\n\n4. **Plan Explosions:**\n   - Focus on using explosions to clear out walls and provide access to the goal while also damaging enemies.\n   - Consider the right timing for explosions to ensure maximum effect without harming yourself.\n\n5. **Conserve Lives:**\n   - Avoid risky plays early in the game while you still have multiple lives.\n   - Once you've eliminated enough threats or cleared enough space, you can become bolder.\n\n6. **Utilize Power-Ups:**\n   - If available, collect items or power-ups that can enhance your bombs or offer defensive capabilities.\n\nBy applying these strategies and being mindful of your surroundings and the game's mechanics, players can effectively navigate challenges and reach their objectives within the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_4 -> 'f'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'h'\nbomb_3 -> 'i'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'j'\nbomb_2 -> 'k'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'l'\nbomb_1 -> 'm'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'n'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'o'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'p'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'q'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 -> 'r'\nexplosionDown -> 't'\nexplosionLeft -> 'u'\nexplosionRight -> 'v'\nexplosionUp -> 'x'\nbomb bomb_1 -> 'y'\nbomb -> 'z'\nbomb explosionUp -> 'A'\nexplosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'B'\nexplosionDown explosionUp -> 'C'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'D'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'E'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> @\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> E\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> p\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> m\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",
