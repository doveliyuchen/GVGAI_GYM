Players strategically use bombs to navigate through a grid-filled arena, defeating enemies and reaching a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Player**: Represented by 'bomberman', who uses bombs to interact with the environment and the enemies.\n   - **Enemies**: Includes bats, spiders, and scorpions that have random movement and cooldown mechanics.\n   - **Obstacles**: Various forms of walls and breakable barriers that can be interacted with using bombs or direct movement.\n   - **Bombs**: Players can place bombs that will trigger explosions, affecting nearby sprites (enemies, walls, etc.).\n   - **Explosions**: Trigger chain reactions with a specific pattern in all four directions (up, down, left, right).\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The bomberman can use bombs to destroy enemies and walls, as well as to clear their way to the goal.\n   - An explosion can damage or destroy anything in its path, including the player if they are not cautious.\n   - After placing a bomb, new bomb types are spawned, enhancing gameplay variety.\n\n3. **Controls**:\n   - Movement of the bomberman will involve strategic placement of bombs to avoid being caught in their explosive radius while also defeating enemies.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, represented by a green door, before the bomberman is defeated.\n- Defeating enemies and obstacles can also yield score changes, suggesting that scoring could be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Players win if they reach the goal ('goal' sprite) and score at least 10 points.\n- Players lose if the 'bomberman' sprite count reaches zero, indicating the player has lost all lives or has been defeated.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Controlled Bomb Placement**: Always be strategic in placing bombs. Plan where enemies are located and anticipate their movements to ensure effective hits while keeping yourself safe.\n\n2. **Watch Out for Chain Reactions**: Understand the explosion patterns and the interactions between different bomb types. A well-placed bomb can trigger a chain reaction that clears multiple threats at once.\n\n3. **Clear Path to Goal**: Focus on creating a clear path to the goal, utilizing bombs to remove obstacles and defeat enemies as you progress.\n\n4. **Avoidance Tactics**: Move carefully around the map while keeping an eye on enemies. Since they move randomly, make sure you are not cornered or trapped.\n\n5. **Continuous Movement**: Stay mobile to avoid unnecessary damage from enemy attacks or bomb explosions. Always be ready to reposition after placing bombs or after explosions.\n\n6. **Scoring Opportunities**: Defeat enemies whenever possible for scores that may provide beneficial points, but remember that reaching the goal is the primary objective.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and understanding the mechanics and interactions within the game, players will maximize their chances of winning while enjoying the tactical gameplay.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nexplosionDown -> 'k'\nexplosionLeft -> 'l'\nexplosionRight -> 'm'\nexplosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb -> 'o'\nbomb explosionLeft -> 'p'\nexplosionDown explosionRight explosionUp -> 'q'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft -> 'r'\nexplosionDown explosionRight -> 't'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> j\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> %\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

Looking at the state of the arena, I see potential threats in the form of enemies: '@' (bats) are located at (3, 14) and (5, 11), while there is a '%' (scorpion) located at (6, 16) and '&' (spider) located at (7, 1). \n\nMy objective is to reach the green door ('goal' represented by '$') at (3, 1) while avoiding damage from enemies and explosions. \n\n### Evaluating my options:\n- **Movement**: \n  - I can potentially move up, down, left, or right.\n  - Currently, there is a wall ('*') immediately above (4, 5) at (3, 5).\n  - There is wall ('*') below (4, 5) at (5, 5).\n  - I can move left to (4, 4) which is a breakable wall ('b').\n  - I can move right to (4, 6) which is an explosion ('j') likely due to previously placed bombs.\n\nConsidering these evaluations, I realize that moving left (to (4, 4)) allows me to break a wall, potentially clearing paths further and providing new strategies. Following the initial strategy that emphasizes controlled bomb placement and clearing paths towards the goal, I will go ahead with that movement.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves me left to (4, 4) where I can break the wall, and I expect to find more opportunities to navigate towards the goal.",
