Players navigate a grid-like maze, using bombs to defeat enemies and reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- The player controls a character (the \"bomberman\") who can place bombs on the grid.\n- There are destructible walls (wallBreak) that can be cleared with bombs, creating pathways.\n- Enemies, represented by various sprites (e.g., bats, spiders, scorpions), move randomly and can cause damage to the player.\n- The explosions generated by the bombs can damage both enemies and the player if timed poorly.\n- The player must collect bombs from the designated areas (items in the background) to continue using them against enemies and obstacles.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal is to reach the \"Goal\" sprite (represented as a green door) while defeating enemies and avoiding death from either enemy attacks or the player's bombs.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- The player wins by reaching the goal and scoring 10 points.\n- The player loses if the bomberman is killed (SpriteCounter for bomberman hits 0) or if the player runs out of bombs without being able to progress.\n\n**Strategy Recommendations:**  \n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout to effectively navigate between enemies, bomb placements, and the goal. Planning your route will minimize risk and improve your efficiency.\n\n2. **Distance Management:** Position yourself safely away from where you place bombs. The explosions can damage you, so always step back after placing bombs.\n\n3. **Enemy Movement:** Observe enemy patterns and wait for the right moment to place bombs to maximize impact. Use walls and obstacles strategically to control enemy movements into your bomb's blast radius.\n\n4. **Wall Breaks:** Use bomb placements to remove wallBreak obstacles strategically, creating new pathways and opportunities to reach enemies or the goal.\n\n5. **Collecting Bombs:** Always be on the lookout for bomb pickups to sustain your offensive capabilities. Don't waste bombs unnecessarily; prioritize placements that lead to enemy defeat or goal access.\n\n6. **Avoid Panic:** Stay calm when faced with enemies and explosions. Analyzing your surroundings before acting can lead to smarter plays and avoids unnecessary deaths.\n\n7. **Explosions Chain:** Take advantage of cascading explosions to chain damage to multiple enemies or multiple walls; carefully planning can create a domino effect.\n\nBy following these strategies while considering the game's mechanics and interactions, players can successfully navigate through levels, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'h'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'j'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'k'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'l'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'm'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> %\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> o\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> n\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> @\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> %\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",
