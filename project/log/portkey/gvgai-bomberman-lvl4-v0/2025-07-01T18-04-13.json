    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThe game appears to be a puzzle-action type that involves elements of strategic planning as players navigate through levels while avoiding enemies and trying to achieve objectives through explosions.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n- **Sprites:** \n  - The main characters include a Bomberman-like avatar and various enemies (bat, spider, scorpion).\n  - The objective is to reach a \"goal\" represented by a green door.\n  - Bombs serve as a primary mechanic for both offense (defeating enemies or clearing paths) and defense (removing certain wall types).\n\n- **Interactions:** \n  - Players can move backward upon colliding with walls, which suggests navigation through a maze-like structure.\n  - Bombs can be placed strategically; they can explode to remove walls, defeat enemies, or even kill the Bomberman character itself if not careful.\n  - Explosions can spread in multiple directions, indicating tactical placements are crucial for maximizing damage to enemies and altering the environment.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe player aims to reach the \"goal\" door while managing to stay alive throughout the level.\n\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal door (score changes, suggesting scoring is a component).\n- **Loss Condition:** The Bomberman sprite is eliminated (SpriteCounter for Bomberman hits 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the maze layout. Knowing the location of walls, breakable walls, and the goal will inform your strategy.\n  \n2. **Bomb Placement:**\n   - Use bombs wisely. Try to place them in areas where they can not only remove breakable walls but also affect enemy positions. \n   - Detonate bombs in ways that allow for multi-directional explosions\u2014this can take out multiple enemies if timed correctly.\n  \n3. **Enemy Management:**\n   - Take note of enemy movement patterns (likely generated by the cooldown mechanisms). Position bombs to interact with them effectively, enabling both offensive plays and improvement of your position.\n\n4. **Avoid Self-Destruction:**\n   - Avoid placing bombs near your character. Always plan at least one step back in case of an unexpected explosion or enemy movement that could threaten you after placing bombs.\n\n5. **Use the Environment:**\n   - Utilize walls and breakable walls as shields against enemies. Use explosions to create barriers where you can threaten enemies without exposing yourself too much.\n\n6. **Prioritize the Goal:**\n   - Always keep the main goal in sight. Plan the route that allows you to reach it effectively while managing enemies and hazards.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis game incorporates strategic placement of bombs and careful navigation while avoiding enemies to achieve the main objective. The focus on both offensive bomb usage and defensive positioning can lead to a successful play. Players will achieve the best results by planning their moves carefully, understanding enemy patterns, and maximizing the effectiveness of their bombs.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_8 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_7 -> 'h'\nbomb_4 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_6 -> 'j'\nbomb_3 -> 'k'\nbomb_2 -> 'l'\nbomb_5 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'm'\nbomb_1 -> 'n'\nbomb_4 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> n\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> @\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> o\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> @\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> %\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "To start analyzing the current state, let's identify the relevant positions:\n\n- **Bomberman Avatar ('#')**: located at (2, 5).\n- **Goal ('$')**: located at (3, 1).\n- **Enemies**: a Scorpion ('%') at (1, 2) and another Scorpion ('%') at (4, 16), as well as a Spider ('&') at (4, 2).\n- **Breakable Wall ('b')**: located at various points, particularly at (2, 4) and (3, 3).\n\n**Current state actions:**\n\n1. The Bomberman must reach the goal at (3, 1), which is not directly adjacent but can be approached by navigating through the walls.\n2. There are breakable walls nearby that could potentially allow paths toward the goal.\n3. The enemies' locations indicate a possible source of danger, so cautious movement is necessary to avoid losing lives.\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\n- The first step would be to consider a movement towards the goal while avoiding the enemies. The quickest way to move towards the goal is to break walls in direction of the goal and navigate around enemies if they pose a risk.\n- A potential action could be to move downwards to (3, 5) first and explore options.\n\nThus, I will move **DOWN** to position (3, 5).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will change the position of the Bomberman and allows further evaluation of the environment around (3, 5). I expect to find more options to navigate towards the goal while managing potential threats from the enemies.",
