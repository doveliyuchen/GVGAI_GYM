    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**: \nThe game appears to fit into the **Puzzle/Strategy** genre, possibly within the subcategory of **Bomber** games, similar to titles like Bomberman. It involves careful planning and spatial awareness.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n- **Sprites**: The game utilizes various sprites, including the **bomberman**, multiple types of **bombs**, **enemies** (bats, spiders, scorpions), walls, and a **goal** (a green door).\n- **Interactions**: Key interactions include using bombs to destroy walls, creating chain reactions of explosions, avoiding enemy attacks, and strategically guiding the bomberman to the goal.\n- **Bomb Mechanics**: The bomberman uses bombs that can explode and affect certain sprites (enemies, walls), and different bomb types appear as the game progresses (from **bomb_1** to **bomb_10**).\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the bomberman to the **goal (green door)** while manipulating the environment using bombs to eliminate enemies and open pathways.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins if they reach the **goal**.\n- **Losing Condition**: The player loses if the **bomberman** is killed (when the sprite counter for bomberman reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: \n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout, including wall placements and enemy locations. This helps to plan movement routes and bomb placements effectively.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement**: \n   - Position bombs strategically to maximize explosion effectiveness. Use them to break walls or take out enemies that block your path or threaten your health.\n\n3. **Chain Reactions**: \n   - Utilize the game's bombing mechanics to create chain reactions, which can eliminate multiple enemies or destroy walls in one go. This is essential for opening paths quickly.\n\n4. **Enemy Avoidance**: \n   - Be cautious of enemies like bats, spiders, and scorpions. Monitor their movement patterns and try to stay clear of their attacking range, especially while placing bombs.\n\n5. **Iterative Approach**: \n   - If you encounter failure, analyze what went wrong\u2014was it bomb placement, poor timing with enemies, or misjudged paths? Use this information to adjust strategies in subsequent attempts.\n\n6. **Prioritize the Goal**: \n   - Always keep the goal in mind. While eliminating enemies can be helpful, your main focus should be on reaching the goal safely.\n\n7. **Bomb Management**: \n   - Pay attention to the types of bombs and how they interact with the environment. Better bombs (like bomb_10) may have stronger effects, so plan your use around these more powerful items when possible.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can enhance your gameplay experience and increase your chances of successfully reaching the goal while navigating potential threats from enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_9 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'h'\nbomb_8 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'j'\nbomb_7 -> 'k'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 bomb_4 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'l'\nbomb_6 -> 'm'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_5 -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> @\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> b\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> o\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> n\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> *\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> %\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

Directly beneath me at (4, 5) is a bomb 'o', which I can use strategically in this puzzle game to either eliminate nearby threats or clear pathways.\n2. To the left at (3, 4) is a wall 'b', while to the right (3, 6) is a bomb 'o' as well, providing further options for bomb manipulation.\n3. Above me (2, 5) is an empty space, while below me (4, 5) has a bomb, meaning I can create a strategic play using the bombs.\n\n### Strategy:\n- I will use the bomb immediately available to me at (4, 5) to create an explosive effect, which might help clear surrounding walls and eliminate an enemy if directed appropriately.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince my last position didn't change, and the best course of action is to use the bomb placed beneath me to initiate a strategic explosion.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nUsing the bomb should optimize my path towards the goal and help manage any enemies nearby effectively, better aligning with our strategy to prioritize reaching the goal while navigating threats.",
