    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**  \nThe game appears to fall under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players navigate through a level, avoiding obstacles and utilizing items to reach a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** Different sprites represent various elements in the game, including the player (avatar), goals, keys, obstacles (walls, holes, mushrooms), and movable blocks (boxes).\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move around and interact with different objects, such as keys and boxes.\n- **Interactions:** There are specific interactions defined between sprites, such as:\n  - Moving against walls causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Falling into a hole results in the avatar's elimination (game over).\n  - Collecting a key transforms the avatar's state (from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n  - Reaching the goal with the key allows the player to win.\n  - Various outcomes occur when different sprites interact, for example, two sprites can kill each other if they fall into a hole together.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite. However, the avatar must first collect the 'key' sprite to unlock the goal, which is critical for winning. The player must navigate through platforms (represented by 'floor' sprites) and avoid dangerous elements (such as 'holes' and 'mushrooms').\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - Successfully reach the 'goal' sprite while in the 'withkey' state (after obtaining the key).\n- **Loss Condition:** \n  - Losing all avatars (if the avatar falls into a hole or collides with a mushroom).\n\n### Level Layout Analysis\n```\nwwwww\nwgAww\nww..w\nw.11w\nwwk.w\nwwwww\n```\n- **Walls (w)** form barriers that guide movement.\n- **Goal (g)** is located just above the avatar (A).\n- **Key (k)** is placed in a lower row, which indicates that the avatar must navigate downward to collect it before attempting to reach the goal.\n- **Blocks (1)** seem to represent interactive elements. The avatar may need to manipulate these to access the key or make a path to the goal.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Initial Positioning:** The avatar starts already above the goal. \n\n2. **Key Collection:**\n   - Move the avatar down and towards the left to collect the key. Avoid walls and ensure that interactions with hole objects do not occur.\n\n3. **Obstacle Navigation:**\n   - Watch out for mushrooms and holes while moving. Ensure that any movement towards a mushroom or hole is calculated; if possible, use the box to navigate space while avoiding hazards.\n\n4. **Reaching the Goal:**\n   - Once the key is collected, carefully plan the route back to the goal (g). Ensure the avatar is in 'withkey' state before stepping on the goal for successful completion.\n\n5. **Avoiding Death:** \n   - Keep track of potential hazards during movement, especially avoiding falling into holes and interacting with mushrooms. Take careful moves in tight spaces.\n\nBy following these strategies, players should be able to navigate the level effectively, collect necessary items, and ultimately reach the goal for victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
