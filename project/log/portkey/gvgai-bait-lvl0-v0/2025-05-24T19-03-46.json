    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer with elements of exploration and strategy. Players control a character that must navigate through levels to collect items and reach a goal, while avoiding obstacles and managing resources.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites**: Different types of sprites (floor, wall, holes, boxes, keys, etc.) interact in specific ways, defining the gameplay mechanics.\n- **Movement and Interaction**: The main sprite, the avatar, moves around and can interact with immovable and passive objects. The avatar can step back when colliding with walls, be killed by falling into holes or mushrooms, and can bounce off boxes.\n- **Transformation**: The avatar can change form based on interactions with keys, which gives it the ability to open doors.\n- **Scoring System**: Players score points when certain interactions occur, such as falling into a hole with a box, and can achieve a final score through reaching the goal.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite while managing the transformation of the avatar and interactions with other objects, mainly to collect the key and unlock the door.\n- Players need to avoid obstacles that can cause the loss of the avatar (i.e., holes and mushrooms).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having no goal sprites remain on the field, which occurs when the avatar successfully reaches the goal after obtaining the key.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if there are no remaining avatars, suggesting they have fallen into traps or have otherwise been eliminated.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan your route**: Before starting the movement, analyze the layout and plan a direct path to reach the key and the goal while avoiding the mushrooms and holes.\n\n2. **Prioritize key collection**: Focus on getting the key as soon as possible because the avatar is required to interact with the goal. Transforming your avatar into the one with the key (from 'nokey' to 'withkey') is critical.\n\n3. **Avoid traps**: Steer clear of holes and mushrooms unless you are sure they are part of a strategy (like the box interaction). Keep moving carefully to avoid unnecessary deaths.\n\n4. **Use boxes effectively**: Consider bouncing off boxes to navigate tricky spots, and remember that boxes can interact negatively with holes. Make sure to use boxes to facilitate safe movement.\n\n5. **Always expect to step back**: Be ready to retreat when facing walls, ensuring you don\u2019t make hasty moves that could lead your avatar into traps.\n\n6. **Scoring management**: Keep track of scoring interactions, as accumulating points might help unlock other game elements or just serve as a secondary objective.\n\nBy mastering the mechanics and leveraging the interactions with different sprites, you can navigate through the levels successfully and complete the game's objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

The goal ('#') is located at (1, 1), and the key ('$') needed to unlock the goal is at (4, 2). \n\n### Current State Summary:\n- Avatar Position: (3, 2)\n- Key Position: (4, 2)\n- Goal Position: (1, 1)\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. We can move **DOWN** to (4, 2), which is where the key is located. \n2. We can also consider other movements (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), but they do not lead closer to the key or facilitate reaching the goal as efficiently.\n\nGiven the strategy of prioritizing key collection and ensuring we safely navigate to avoid traps, the best immediate action is to move down to collect the key.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: This action will move the avatar down to collect the key, setting us up to reach the goal in subsequent moves. I expect to see the avatar now with the key, which is crucial for progressing towards the goal.",
