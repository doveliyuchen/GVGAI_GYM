    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an 'avatar' that can move around the level.\n*   **Object Manipulation:** The player interacts with 'box' objects, potentially pushing them.\n*   **Key/Lock:** There is a key ('key') that needs to be collected to open a goal ('goal'). The avatar transforms upon collecting the key, suggesting a key-carrying state.\n*   **Obstacles & Hazards:** 'Wall' sprites block movement, 'hole' sprites are deadly, and 'mushroom' sprites give the player a score but also kill the avatar.\n*   **Limited Undoing:** A complex interaction suggests the possibility of undoing moves in specific situations (\"box wall box mushroom > undoAll\").\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe primary objective is to open the goal ('goal') by collecting the key ('key') and then reaching the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** The player wins when all goal sprites are removed from the map (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True), which most likely happens when the player interacts with it while holding the key.\n*   **Loss:** The player loses when the avatar sprite count reaches zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False), meaning the avatar is killed.\n\n**Sprite Meanings:**\n\n*   **floor:** Empty space the avatar can move on.\n*   **hole:** A hazard that kills the avatar.\n*   **avatar:** The player-controlled character.\n*   **nokey:** The avatar sprite *before* picking up the key.\n*   **withkey:** The avatar sprite *after* picking up the key.\n*   **mushroom:** Gives a score but also kills the avatar.\n*   **key:** An item required to open the goal.\n*   **goal:** The exit that needs a key to unlock.\n*   **box:** A pushable object.\n*   **wall:** Impassable barrier.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Represents a wall.\n*   `g`: Represents the goal.\n*   `A`: Represents the starting position of the avatar ('nokey' state).\n*   `.`: Represents the floor.\n*   `1`: Represents a box.\n*   `k`: Represents the key.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** The first priority is to get the key.\n2.  **Box Manipulation:** Learn how to move the boxes. They are essential for solving the puzzle, especially for possibly blocking holes or activating the \"undoAll\" interaction.\n3.  **Hazard Avoidance:** Steer clear of the 'hole' sprites.\n4.  **Mushroom Consideration:** Only touch the mushroom if the score is needed or strategically beneficial.\n5.  **Strategic Thinking:** Plan moves carefully. Given the potential for undoing moves in a specific situation, think ahead to avoid getting stuck.\n6.  **Understand Interactions:** The 'box wall box mushroom > undoAll' interaction is particularly important. Figure out how to reliably trigger it to correct mistakes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",
