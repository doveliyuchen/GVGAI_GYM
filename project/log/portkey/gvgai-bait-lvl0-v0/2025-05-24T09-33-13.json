    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game appears to fall within the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players navigate through a level while solving puzzles to achieve a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The available sprites include the avatar (player character), walls, holes (which are hazards), keys, boxes, mushrooms (hazards), and a goal (door).\n- **Interactions:** The avatar has specific interactions with other sprites:\n  - **Walls**: The avatar cannot pass through walls and will step back if it collides with one.\n  - **Holes**: Falling into a hole will result in losing the game.\n  - **Boxes**: The avatar can bounce off boxes, which can lead to strategic movement.\n  - **Keys**: The avatar must collect a key to transform from a \"nokey\" state to a \"withkey\" state, allowing access to the goal.\n  - **Hazards**: Encountering mushrooms results in losing a life but offers score points. Collecting keys or reaching the goal gives points.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal (the door) in the avatar's \"withkey\" state, which means the player must collect the key first. Successfully reaching the goal will change the state of the goal sprite and ultimately result in a win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal while holding the key (no remaining goal sprites).\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - If the avatar's sprite count reaches zero, the game ends in a loss.\n  - Falling into a hole also results in an immediate loss.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Understand the layout\u2014walls and holes are critical. Carefully plan movements to avoid falling into holes and getting stuck against walls.\n  \n2. **Key Collection**: Prioritize reaching the key quickly since obtaining it transforms your avatar state from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\". You won\u2019t be able to access the goal without this transformation.\n\n3. **Hazard Management**: Avoid mushrooms as they will cost you lives. Instead, try using boxes strategically to potentially gain height or momentum while avoiding danger.\n\n4. **Bouncing Off Boxes**: Use the bouncing mechanic effectively to navigate around obstacles. Once you bounce off a box, it might lead to a better position to access the key or avoid hazards.\n\n5. **Planning Movements**: Since interaction with walls leads to stepping back, plan your movements to avoid getting blocked and losing critical progress.\n\n6. **Scoring**: Collect points from mushrooms only if it doesn\u2019t lead you closer to falling. The goal is to win, so prioritize reaching it over merely accumulating points.\n\n7. **Level Navigation**: Carefully analyze each level design to plot the best route to the goal after obtaining the key. Recognize the locations of walls and holes in advance to avoid unwanted losses.\n\nBy following these strategic suggestions and understanding the game mechanics, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating through levels and ultimately achieving their goals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
