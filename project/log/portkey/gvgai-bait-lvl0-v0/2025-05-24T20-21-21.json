Players control a character (avatar) and must navigate through a level filled with obstacles and items that require strategic movement and interaction to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - The environment contains walls, holes, and a goal. \n   - The avatar can interact with items such as boxes and keys.\n   - The avatar can transform when interacting with the key by changing from 'nokey' to 'withkey'.\n\n2. **Interactivity**:\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls and will step back if it collides with one.\n   - Hitting a hole results in the avatar\u2019s defeat.\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes.\n   - Collecting items like the key is essential to unlock the goal.\n   - Interacting with mushrooms or holes can also lead to a score change but is detrimental to the avatar's survival.\n\n3. **Score System**:\n   - The player gains points by collecting keys and defeating boxes when they fall into holes.\n   - Reaching the goal with the key provides substantial points.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal (door) after obtaining a key while avoiding hazards (such as holes and mushrooms). The player needs to ensure that the avatar survives to complete the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal while in the 'withkey' state, which also scores points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated (by falling into a hole or by interacting with a mushroom).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Navigate Carefully**: Move towards collecting the key without approaching holes or mushrooms that can kill the avatar. \n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Boxes can be used to create platforms or to bounce when needed. Make sure to place them correctly to avoid causing problems (like getting stuck or losing).\n\n3. **Transforming**: After collecting the key, ensure you interact with the goal while in the 'withkey' state. This is critical to advancing the level and increasing your score.\n\n4. **Plan Ahead**: Look at the level layout and plan movements in advance to avoid traps. Identify paths that lead to the key and the goal while steering clear of hazards.\n\n5. **Practice Timing**: Since the avatar interacts with various sprites dynamically, timing interactions can be crucial\u2014especially with boxes and the goal. Make timed movements to avoid collisions that may cause setbacks.\n\nBy employing these strategies and keeping an eye on the interaction rules, players have a higher chance of successfully navigating levels while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

The goal (represented by the '#' symbol) is located at row 1, column 1. The key (represented by the '$' symbol) is located at row 4, column 2. \n\n### Current Observations:\n- **Avatar Position**: The avatar is currently in the 'nokey' state at (3, 2).\n- **Obstacles**: The immediate surroundings include walls, an empty floor, and a box at (4, 3).\n- **Goal**: The goal is located above the avatar, at (1, 1), and will require the key to be reached.\n- **Key**: The key is below the avatar, located at (4, 2).\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Collect the Key**: The avatar should first try to collect the key, which is necessary to reach the goal.\n2. **Movement**: The avatar can move down to collect the key at (4, 2) without colliding with walls or other obstacles.\n\nGiven this information, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down to (4, 2) will allow the avatar to collect the key and enable progression towards the goal. This action aligns with our strategy of obtaining necessary items to win the game.",
