    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThis game likely falls under the categories of puzzle platformer or adventure game. The presence of sprites that interact with each other to create solutions suggests a focus on strategic movement and problem-solving.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various sprites including walls, holes, keys, goals, boxes, mushrooms, and the avatar which can move and interact with other sprites.\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move through the environment but has restrictions on certain interactions (e.g., stepping back from walls, being killed by holes or mushrooms).\n- **Transformation:** The avatar can transform from \u2018nokey\u2019 to \u2018withkey\u2019 upon collecting a key, which is necessary to access the goal.\n- **Scoring:** The game has a score system where interacting with certain items (like mushrooms and goals) can change the player's score.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the goal (represented by the closed door) after acquiring the key. Successfully reaching the goal while in the 'withkey' state will yield a score change (win condition).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by destroying the goal sprite with the avatar in the 'withkey' state; the goal sprite limit reaches 0.\n- **Loss Condition:** If all avatar sprites are killed (limit reaches 0), the player loses.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Begin by observing the layout. Identify the location of the key and the goal.\n   - Take care to avoid holes and mushrooms, as they can cause instant loss of the avatar.\n\n2. **Obstacle Navigation:**\n   - Utilize boxes to help navigate through the level. Bouncing off boxes can be key to getting around obstacles.\n   - Use walls strategically: move back when colliding and look for alternate paths.\n\n3. **Key Acquisition:**\n   - Head towards the location of the key to transform your avatar into the 'withkey' state. This will allow access to the goal.\n\n4. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - After acquiring the key and transitioning to 'withkey,' make your way back to the goal.\n   - Play carefully to avoid any further collisions with hazards that might endanger your avatar.\n\n5. **Score Maximization:**\n   - Warning on collecting mushrooms or other score-affecting items; use them wisely to increase your score if possible before reaching the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis game requires players to think strategically about movements and interactions with other sprites to successfully progress through the level and achieve the final goal. Careful navigation and smart use of available sprites will be crucial for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

This will transform our avatar to 'withkey' when we collect the key, enabling us to access the goal.\n\nGiven the current state and the strategy of acquiring the key first to reach the goal, the next logical step is to move down.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move my avatar down to collect the key, which is essential to progress towards the goal.",
