Players navigate through a level solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles to reach a specific goal, which is common in this genre.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Characters:**\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move through the level.\n   - **Key**: A collectible that transforms the avatar and is necessary to unlock the goal.\n   - **Goal**: The target that must be reached, which opens upon acquiring the key.\n   - **Boxes**: Can be interacted with; bouncing the avatar forward or potentially causing problems when near walls or mushrooms.\n   - **Mushroom**: An obstacle that kills the avatar upon contact.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar must avoid walls and holes, which can either harm the avatar or cause it to step back.\n   - The interaction with the key transforms the avatar into a state that allows it to open the goal.\n   - Collecting the key and reaching the goal is essential to win the game, while encountering mushrooms or falling into holes results in losing.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to collect the key and use it to access the goal while avoiding hazards like holes and mushrooms.\n- Successfully reaching the goal with the transformed avatar is key to winning the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal after transforming with the key, resulting in the score increase.\n- Loss Condition: The game is lost if the avatar's sprite limit reaches zero, meaning the avatar dies.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Navigate Cautiously**: Always be aware of the surroundings; avoid walls that force you back and holes that kill the avatar.\n\n2. **Collect the Key**: Prioritize reaching the key first. This is essential for transforming to open the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: \n   - Steer clear of mushrooms to prevent unnecessary deaths.\n   - Manage interactions with boxes carefully; they can cause setbacks if you inadvertently bounce into them.\n\n4. **Plan Your Route**: Analyze the level layout thoroughly before moving. \n   - Plan how to reach the key and then the goal while avoiding or accounting for the hazards in your path.\n\n5. **Utilize Box Mechanics**: Use boxes to your advantage in navigating the level. They can help with movement but also require careful interaction to prevent falling into pits.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the level, minimizing the risk of losing while maximizing their chances of winning by reaching the goal after collecting the key.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
