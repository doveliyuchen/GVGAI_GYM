Players control a moving avatar that navigates a map filled with obstacles (walls, holes, mushrooms) and interacts with various objects (boxes, keys, goals).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites that players will encounter, including:\n   - **Walls**: Immovable barriers.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous spots that can eliminate the avatar.\n   - **Boxes**: Movable objects used to solve puzzles.\n   - **Keys**: Objects that transform the avatar when interacted with.\n   - **Goals**: Objects representing level completion.\n   - **Mushrooms**: Objects that can harm the avatar.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows specific interactions between sprites:\n   - The avatar can step back from walls, is killed by holes, and can bounce forward when colliding with boxes.\n   - A box can be destroyed when it falls into a hole, and this interaction increments the score.\n   - The avatar can collect a key to transform. Having the key allows the avatar to open the goal.\n   - Some sprites can kill the avatar and change the score.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, avoid traps, and ultimately reach the goal by transforming the avatar with a key. The player wins when the number of goal sprites reaches zero.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the goal sprite count reaches zero after the avatar reaches the 'goal' using the 'withkey' state.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has been killed.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious of holes and mushrooms, as they can kill the avatar. Carefully plan movements to avoid falling into these traps.\n2. **Key Collection**: Focus on collecting the key as quickly as possible. This will be essential for reaching the goal.\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Leverage the boxes to navigate through the level and eliminate other objects. Moving boxes towards holes can increase your score while potentially clearing your path.\n4. **Plan Movement**: Your movements need to be strategic to avoid unnecessary steps backward due to walls or falling into holes. Always be aware of the next move.\n5. **Transforming the Avatar**: After obtaining the key, ensure to position correctly to transform the avatar to advance towards the goal.\n6. **Score Awareness**: Keep track of your score as you interact with holes and mushrooms, as managing your score can be part of the strategy to maintain avatar survival.\n\nFollowing these strategies will help ensure that players can navigate through levels effectively, keeping the avatar alive while achieving the primary goal of reaching the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",
