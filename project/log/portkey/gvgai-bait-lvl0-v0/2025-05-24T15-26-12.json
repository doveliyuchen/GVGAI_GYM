    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. Players control an avatar (likely a character controlled by the player) and execute various maneuvers to solve puzzles and reach a certain objective while navigating platforms, obstacles, and enemies.\n\n#### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - There are different types of sprites, including movable elements (like the avatar) and static elements (like walls and the goal).\n   - The avatar can interact with several objects, including keys, mushrooms, boxes, and walls.\n\n2. **Interactions:** \n   - The avatar can transform when collecting a key, turning from \"nokey\" to \"withkey.\"\n   - Interaction with walls causes the avatar to step back, while interacting with holes results in death (losing a life).\n   - Boxes can be used as a means of propulsion when bumped by the avatar, and they can also interact with other sprites leading to various outcomes (e.g., destroying a box in a hole gives points).\n\n3. **Scoring:**\n   - The player gains points through specific actions, such as touching mushrooms and removing boxes that fall into holes.\n   - The ultimate objective score is achieved when the key is obtained, allowing access to the goal.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the \"goal\" sprite, but first, the player must collect a \"key\" to unlock this goal. The player transitioning from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" signifies they can now reach the goal. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the number of \"goal\" sprites reaches zero (indicating the player has reached the goal).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the number of \"avatar\" sprites reaches zero (indicative of losing the player avatar).\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Understand the Layout:** Review the level layout thoroughly before progressing to determine strategic movements and interactions.\n  \n2. **Collect the Key:** The first goal should be to safely navigate the avatar to collect the key. Observe the position of walls and holes that could potentially cause the avatar to lose life.\n  \n3. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Utilize boxes for strategy\u2014whether to help jump into certain areas or push them into holes for a score. Ensure the avatar does not inadvertently get killed through mismanagement.\n  \n4. **Avoid Hazards:** Be cautious of holes and mushrooms; touching these will reduce the avatar count. Prioritize navigating the maze without hitting these dangers.\n  \n5. **Plan Movements:** Since the avatar will be stepping back upon hitting a wall, plan your route carefully to minimize steps back, allowing for smoother progression towards the goal.\n\n6. **Focus on Timing:** Timing interactions, especially around moving obstacles and when trying to collect the key, is crucial to ensuring a successful navigation of the level.\n\nBy carefully strategizing, prioritizing collecting the key while avoiding hazards, and using boxes effectively, players can successfully reach their goal and win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

    "content": "To determine the next action, let's analyze the current state and the layout based on the map provided:\n\n1. **Current Location of the Avatar (`%`)**: The avatar is at (row 2, col 2).\n2. **Nearby Entities**: \n   - Up (row 1, col 2): floor (`.`)\n   - Down (row 3, col 2): floor (`.`)\n   - Left (row 2, col 1): floor (`.`)\n   - Right (row 2, col 3): floor (`.`)\n\n3. **Goal and Key Availability**: \n   - The goal (`#`) is located at (row 1, col 1).\n   - The avatar currently does not have a key (`%`), so it cannot access the goal yet.\n\n4. **Immediate Objective**: Ultimately, we need to collect keys, but we should explore our surroundings to see if there are options to reach the key effectively.\n\nBased on this analysis, the avatar can move freely in any of the four directions without any immediate hazards (like walls or holes). However, moving down does not seem to lead to a more advantageous position towards the goals or keys. \n\nGiven the strategy to avoid hazards and pursue the key, moving up to (row 1, col 2) might allow for better navigation maneuver toward collecting the key.\n\nThus, the action is:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nMoving up aligns with the strategy since it opens up more movement options while moving closer to the top row which has the goal. I'm expecting to potentially navigate towards the key next, depending on subsequent actions.",
