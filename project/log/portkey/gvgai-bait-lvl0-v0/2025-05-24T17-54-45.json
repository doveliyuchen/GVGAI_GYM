This genre typically combines the elements of puzzles with platform mechanics, where the player navigates through levels, often involving obstacles and challenges that require problem-solving to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites and Interactions:** \n  - The game features various types of sprites such as walls, floors, holes, a moving avatar, keys, and goals. Each sprite has specific interactions, which dictate how they behave with one another.\n  - The avatar (player character) can move around and interact primarily with the key and the goal.\n  - The \u2018nokey\u2019 (without a key) state of the avatar can transform into \u2018withkey\u2019 upon collecting a key sprite. This transformation is necessary to advance to the goal.\n  - The avatar must avoid falling into the holes, as that results in losing a life. Bouncing off boxes and interacting with mushrooms also has consequences that affect the player\u2019s score.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary goal is to reach the door (goal) while collecting the key necessary to open it. The player must navigate the level, avoiding hazards and optimizing interactions to achieve this.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - The game is won when the avatar (in the \u2018withkey\u2019 state) reaches the goal, which decrements the goal's count to zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** \n  - The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s count reaches zero, often from falling into a hole or being otherwise rendered unable to proceed.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understand the Level Layout:**\n   - Before rushing, analyze the level's layout. Note the position of walls, holes, keys, and the goal.\n   - In the given level layout, the goal is primarily accessible only after acquiring the key.\n\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:**\n   - Focus on navigating to the key first. Without it, reaching the goal is impossible. Pay attention to the safest route to acquire the key without falling into holes.\n\n3. **Utilize Box Mechanics Wisely:**\n   - Use the box strategically to bounce off the walls if needed while avoiding mushrooms and holes. Plan your moves to use the box to clear a path or protect yourself from hazards.\n\n4. **Manage Lives:**\n   - Keep an eye on your avatar's lives. Each fall into a hole or negative interaction reduces your chances of success. Avoid risky maneuvers unless absolutely necessary.\n\n5. **Score Maximization:**\n   - If you're aiming not just to win but also to maximize score, interact cautiously with mushrooms or other scoring elements. Balance risk versus potential score increase.\n\n6. **Experiment and Learn:**\n   - If stuck, experiment with different interactions. The ability to undo actions with box interactions means you can trial-and-error to find the best moves.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the specific game mechanics and layout, you should be well-equipped to navigate through the level successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, let's identify the avatar's position and its surroundings:\n\n- The avatar is in the \"nokey\" state (indicated by '%') located at (3, 2).\n- The goal is located at (1, 1), which we can reach if we collect the key first.\n- The key ('$') is located at (3, 2).\n- The nearby elements consist of walls ('&') and empty floor ('.'), making the surrounding area navigable yet potentially risky.\n\n**Strategy Recap:**\n1. I need to collect the key to change from the \"nokey\" state to \"withkey\" state, which is necessary to reach the goal.\n2. There are no holes (0) or obstacles around me that would impede immediate access to the key located directly at the avatar\u2019s position.\n\nGiven that my current position does not change when I identify the key directly beneath me, my most sensible action is to collect the key first.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action suggests moving down (3,2) to pick up the key. My expectation is that once I perform this action, I will transform into \"withkey\" (indicated by 'k'), allowing me to now proceed safely towards the goal afterward.",
