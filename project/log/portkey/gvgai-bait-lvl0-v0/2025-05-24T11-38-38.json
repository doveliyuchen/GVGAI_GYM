Players navigate through a series of obstacles, utilizing logic and strategy to advance through levels.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** Players control the 'avatar' and interact with various sprites such as walls, keys, goals, mushrooms, holes, and boxes. \n2. **Movement:** The avatar can move but is affected by different interactions. For instance, colliding with walls results in a step back, falling into a hole leads to the avatar's death, and interaction with boxes does specific actions.\n3. **Collectables and Transformations:** The key is vital for transformation, allowing the avatar to change from 'nokey' to 'withkey', which is necessary to complete the level.\n4. **Score System:** Points are scored by interacting with specific items (e.g., killing mushrooms gives 1 point, reaching the goal with the key gives 5 points).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal of the game is to reach the 'goal' sprite while transforming into 'withkey' by collecting the 'key' sprite. The game ends successfully when all 'goal' sprites are cleared (SpriteCounter limit = 0), and unsuccessfully if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit = 0).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** Reach the goal sprite while transformed into 'withkey' (goal must be interacted with while avatar is 'withkey'), which gives points and progresses the game.\n- **Loss:** The avatar is eliminated by falling into a hole or a mushroom (SpriteCounter of avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Analyze the Level Layout:** \n   - Identify critical paths to the key and the goal. Avoid walls and holes that could result in an instant loss.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Navigate to collect the key as a top priority. This transformation is essential for unlocking the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Steer clear of mushrooms and holes to prevent losing the avatar. Planning movements can help avoid being killed.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Utilize box mechanics to bounce forward and possibly clear paths or gain extra points without running into hazards.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Consider each move carefully. The interaction with walls could set you back, so always plan a clear route before proceeding.\n\n6. **Understand Score Benefits:**\n   - Although the primary goal is reaching the goal sprite, accumulating points by interacting with mushrooms (when safe) can aid in maintaining a high score.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the interactions, players can effectively navigate through the puzzle-platformer while minimizing the risk of avatar loss and maximizing score potential.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
