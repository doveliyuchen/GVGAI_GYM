    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game falls under the category of **2D puzzle-platformer**. Players control a character (the avatar) and navigate through a level filled with obstacles and interactions that require strategy and problem-solving skills.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: Various types of sprites represent the different elements in the game, including the player (avatar), obstacles (walls, holes, mushrooms), items (keys, boxes), and goals (the door).\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around, and interactions with other sprites will trigger different outcomes (e.g., stepping back, being killed, transforming, or scoring points).\n- **Transformations**: The avatar can interact with specific items to transform from \u2018nokey\u2019 to \u2018withkey\u2019, which allows access to the goal.\n- **Score System**: Certain interactions yield points, enhancing the gameplay experience and providing a scoring element.\n  \n#### Objective:\nThe primary goal of the game is to navigate the avatar to the 'goal' sprite (the door) while managing interactions with other sprites effectively. To win, players must ensure that the avatar reaches the goal while avoiding deaths.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Reaching the goal with the avatar transformed into \u2018withkey\u2019 (by collecting the key) leads to victory.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero, the player loses.\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Collect**: Start by moving the avatar to explore the level, particularly focusing on locating the key (located at (4,3)).\n2. **Clear Obstacles**: Utilize the box strategically\u2014bounce it off walls or use it to interact with holes to clear pathways or create ways to collect the key.\n3. **Transformation**: Ensure that the avatar collects the key to transform into \u2018withkey\u2019. This is essential to access the goal.\n4. **Avoid Risks**: Be cautious of walls and holes, as falling into a hole results in the avatar's death. Walls will cause the avatar to step back if they attempt to move through them.\n5. **Reach the Goal**: Once the avatar has the key and is transformed, proceed to the door (goal) to achieve victory.\n\nBy carefully managing movements, maximizing interactions, and strategically placing the box, players can successfully navigate the level and complete the game effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar (represented by '%') is located at (3, 2) and currently does not hold a key, which means it cannot access the goal (represented by '#') located at (1, 1). \n\nTo reach the goal, the avatar needs to collect the key (located at (4, 2)). The movements need to be planned to navigate towards the key while avoiding hazards (walls and holes). \n\n### Next Move Decision:\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar is at (3, 2). To collect the key at (4, 2), the avatar must move down.\n2. **Wall and Hole Awareness**: There are no walls or holes directly below the avatar in the next move.\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe most efficient action is to move down from the current position to (4, 2), where the key is located.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should successfully move the avatar down to (4, 2) to allow it to collect the key, facilitating its transformation into \u2018withkey\u2019 for reaching the goal.",
