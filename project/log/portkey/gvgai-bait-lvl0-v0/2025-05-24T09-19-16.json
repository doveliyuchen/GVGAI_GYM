    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nBased on the rules described, this game falls into the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players control an avatar that navigates through a level while avoiding obstacles, collecting items, and solving puzzles to reach a defined goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites (Objects/Entities):** There are various sprites representing the player's avatar, obstacles (walls, mushrooms), items (keys), and goals. \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar moves and interacts with the environment, such as stepping back from walls and dying upon falling into holes.\n  - Keys are essential for transforming the avatar from one state (nokey) to another (withkey), which is crucial to complete the level.\n  - The goal can only be reached when the avatar possesses the key.\n  - The game has mechanics involving bouncing off boxes and dying when hitting certain sprites (holes/mushrooms).\n  \n**Objectives:**  \n- The primary objective is to collect the key and then reach the goal. \n- There are also points involved, which can be obtained by certain actions, like falling into holes or being killed by mushrooms.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** To win, the player must have no remaining goal sprites by successfully reaching the goal sprite while in the state of \"withkey.\"\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends in failure if the avatar is eliminated (loses all lives/limit reached).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Level Gradually:**\n   - Start by understanding the layout and identifying potential threats (like holes and mushrooms).\n   - Note where the key is located relative to walls and other sprites.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Navigate toward the key without running into holes or mushrooms. Avoid obstacles that can lead to elimination.\n   - Once you obtain the key, your avatar state will change to 'withkey', allowing access to the goal.\n\n3. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - After collecting the key, plan the path to the goal. Ensure you avoid holes and that you can access the goal without getting trapped by walls.\n   - Make sure to keep track of your avatar's positioning relative to objects that may change your direction or outcome (like boxes).\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically:**\n   - Bouncing off boxes can help reposition the avatar if you find yourself stuck. Use this mechanic to navigate safely through clusters of obstacles.\n\n5. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks:**\n   - Steer clear of mushrooms, as they lead to score changes that may affect your overall performance, and dying will set you back significantly.\n   - Be mindful of how many lives you have\u2014each interaction can be critical to your survival.\n\n6. **Final Approach to the Goal:**\n   - Once you reach the goal after collecting the key, ensure that you approach it from a safe angle to ensure victory.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players should be able to effectively navigate the challenges of the game and achieve the main objective of reaching the goal while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
