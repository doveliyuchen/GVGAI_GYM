It involves moving through a level while solving puzzles to progress toward a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Key:** An item collectible that transforms the avatar from one type to another (nokey to withkey).\n   - **Goal:** The endpoint that the avatar must reach to win, but requires the key to access.\n   - **Walls, Holes, and Mushrooms:** Obstacles that interact differently with the avatar. Walls can bounce the avatar back, holes are lethal, and mushrooms provide a score penalty if touched.\n\n2. **Interaction Rules:**\n   - The avatar cannot move through walls and must step back if it collides.\n   - Falling into a hole results in the avatar's death.\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, but certain complex interactions can undo previous actions.\n   - Collecting the key changes the avatar's state, allowing it to interact with the goal.\n   - Touching the goal with the key scores points and ends the game successfully.\n   - Touching a mushroom incurs a penalty.\n\n3. **Scoring:** \n   - Collecting the key and reaching the goal yield points.\n   - Penalties are incurred for interacting with mushrooms and falling into holes.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to get the avatar to the 'goal' sprite while managing interactions with keys, obstacles, and scoring. The avatar must collect the key to access the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by reaching the goal with the key (scoreChange of 5).\n- The player loses if the avatar's total count reaches zero from falling into holes or other lethal interactions.\n\n### Level Layout Breakdown:\n- The layout consists of walls (`w`), a goal (`g`), the avatar (`A`), and a key (`k`).\n- **Key Mechanics of this Level:**\n   - The avatar starts positioned in a way that it can reach the key, which is necessary to reach the goal.\n   - Areas marked with `.` might represent spaces that the avatar can move through.\n   - Walls create boundaries that the avatar cannot pass through.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Initial Movement:** Move the avatar to collect the key first. You may need to navigate around walls carefully.\n2. **Collect the Key:** Once you reach the key (`k`), the avatar transforms from `nokey` to `withkey`, allowing you to interact with the goal.\n3. **Navigate to the Goal:** After collecting the key, move toward the goal (`g`). Make sure to avoid any mushrooms to prevent score penalties.\n4. **Avoid Hazards:** Watch out for holes as falling into one can instantly lead to losing the game. Always gauge movement to ensure you're not stepping into the trap.\n5. **Maximize Score:** If you can, try to avoid mushrooms to maintain your score. Each mushroom interaction lowers your total, which is critical in tight score conditions.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics, you should be able to successfully navigate the level and reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the level, the avatar marked by `A` is at position (3, 3). The goal `#` is at (1, 1), and there is a box `*` and a mushroom `%` directly beneath the avatar. \n\nTo achieve the objective of collecting the key and then reaching the goal, the first step is to identify the key's proximity. Observing the map, it appears that there is no key `k` present in this level based on the state provided, therefore, the strategy will focus on reaching the goal while avoiding the obstacles.\n\nCurrently, the avatar can move in the down direction, but it will either land on the mushroom `%` at (3, 3), which would incur a penalty, or proceed to (4, 3) where there is a box `@`. Even though moving down may lead to a score penalty, it's essential to continue progressing in the direction to discover other possible paths or necessary interactions. \n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move down to see if I can get around the mushroom and progress further.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down will allow me to find out more about the surroundings while attempting to navigate the potential obstacles.",
