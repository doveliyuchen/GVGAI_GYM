    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThe game appears to fall under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players must navigate obstacles, avoid dangers, and interact with various items to achieve the objective.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites:** The game features different types of sprites: the player (avatar), keys, obstacles (walls, holes, mushrooms), and goals. Each sprite has unique interactions that impact gameplay.\n- **Movement and Interaction:** The player can move and interact with different objects. For instance, the avatar can bounce off boxes, collect keys, encounter walls, and fall into holes.\n- **Key Mechanics:** The avatar can start as 'nokey' (without the key) and must collect a key to unlock the goal. This transformation is critical to progressing through the level.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite (the closed door) using the avatar while obtaining the key to unlock it. To win, the player must ensure the 'goal' sprite is present while maintaining a non-zero limit of the avatar sprite.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no 'goal' sprites left (sprite counter for 'goal' reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if there are no 'avatar' sprites left (the avatar is eliminated).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Navigation:** Move the avatar carefully to avoid holes, as falling in results in immediate loss, and be cautious of the mushrooms that can also eliminate the avatar upon contact.\n   \n2. **Collecting the Key:** Your first priority should be to locate and collect the key. Reach it by avoiding the dangers initially and then interacting with it to transform from 'nokey' to 'withkey.'\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles:** Use the bounce mechanic of the box to navigate past walls safely, if necessary. If you need to undo movements, plan out your paths carefully.\n\n4. **Reaching the Goal:** Once you obtain the key, you can aim to move towards the goal sprite (the door). Ensure you have taken care to not lose your avatar by avoiding hazards as you approach the goal.\n\n5. **Score Management:** Keep track of your interactions, as some combinations may provide additional scoring, which could also contribute to success in competitive play.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the game's mechanics, players can effectively navigate the challenges presented and achieve their objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, let's map out where the important sprites are positioned and understand the avatar's potential movement.\n\nBased on the provided state:\n\n- The avatar ('%') is located at coordinates (3, 1).\n- The key ('$') is found at (4, 2), which is directly below the avatar's current position.\n- The goal ('#') is located at (1, 1), which is two rows above the avatar.\n\nFrom the current position (3, 1), the immediate next steps should prioritize moving the avatar down to collect the key before heading toward the goal.\n\n### Action Evaluation:\nFrom the position (3, 1), moving down (ACTION_DOWN) is a valid action. \n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action will move the avatar down to (4, 1), which is a key space where the key can be collected in the subsequent move. I expect this action aligns with the strategy as it helps to access the key effectively.",
