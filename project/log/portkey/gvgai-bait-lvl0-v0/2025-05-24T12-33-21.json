    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the game, including its genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. Players control an avatar that navigates a 2D environment to reach objectives, while interacting with various game elements that can affect movement and state.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has different types of sprites including:\n  - **Walls**: Immovable barriers that block the avatar.\n  - **Floor**: Impassable ground with hidden characteristics.\n  - **Holes**: Cause the avatar to die if encountered.\n  - **Boxes and Mushrooms**: Objects that can either bounce the avatar back or result in the avatar's death and point changes.\n  - **Key and Goal**: Collecting keys allows access to goals; reaching the goal while having the key rewards points.\n  \n- **Interactions**: Various interactions govern how the avatar and other sprites behave:\n  - The avatar can step back from walls and is killed by holes.\n  - Interactions with boxes can cause bounces, or unbind previous objects (with mushrooms).\n  - The avatar can transform when interacting with keys, but touching the goal without the key produces no result.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the **goal** sprite, which is located behind a door that requires a **key** to open. To win, you must navigate through the level and collect the key without being killed by holes or mushrooms.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You win by reaching the goal sprite while in the transformed state of having the key (with the 'withkey' sprite).\n- You lose if the avatar sprite is reduced to zero, indicating that the player has lost all lives or failed to navigate correctly.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Carefully navigate around walls and avoid holes to preserve your avatar's life.\n2. **Key Collection**: Focus on collecting the key as soon as possible. This typically involves interaction with the 'nokey' sprite.\n3. **Avoid Dangerous Sprites**: Be cautious of mushrooms and holes which can lead to avatar death. Understanding the layout will help you avoid them.\n4. **Box Interactions**: Use boxes to your advantage. Interacting with them correctly can allow you to bounce forward or set up scenarios that lead to better positioning.\n5. **Plan Your Route**: Since the level is set up in a maze-like structure, plan your movements ahead of time to ensure that once you have the key, you can efficiently reach the goal. \n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics of interactions, players can effectively navigate the game's challenges to reach the objective and succeed.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
