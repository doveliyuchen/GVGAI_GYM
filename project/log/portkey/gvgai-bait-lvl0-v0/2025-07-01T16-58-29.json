    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game is likely a puzzle-platformer that involves navigating a character through a series of challenges using logic, strategy, and timing. Players must avoid hazards and collect items to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites are defined with specific properties and interactions:\n  - **Floor**: Basic walking surface.\n  - **Hole**: A hazard that kills the avatar if stepped on.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move.\n  - **Key and Goal**: The key is required to access the goal (marked door).\n  - **Boxes and Mushrooms**: Passive elements that interact with the avatar.\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar can interact with various sprites (e.g., absorbing keys, bouncing off boxes).\n  - The avatar suffers penalties when hitting walls or holes.\n  - Key mechanics include transforming the avatar upon picking up a key and using it to open the goal door.\n\n#### Objectives\n- **Primary Goal**: Collect the key and reach the goal sprite to win.\n- **Scoring**: Players earn points by interacting with certain sprites (such as mushrooms).\n- **Survival**: Avoid losing the avatar, as its count reaching zero is a loss condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: If the avatar reaches the goal sprite with the key.\n- **Loss**: If the avatar is killed by a hole or collides with harmful sprites, resulting in its count reaching zero.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigating the Level**: Assess the layout before making moves. Take note of walls, holes, and other hazards that could endanger the avatar.\n  \n2. **Key Acquisition**: Ensure to reach the key sprite before attempting to access the goal. The focus should be on avoiding conditions that would cause the avatar\u2019s death.\n\n3. **Utilizing Boxes**: Use boxes strategically to bounce away from hazards or to manipulate the environment. For example, boxes can be used to get past walls.\n\n4. **Avoid Unwanted Interactions**: Steer clear of holes and walls, keep a safe distance from mushrooms unless you want to score points\u2014prioritize collecting the key.\n\n5. **Plan Route to Goal**: Once the key is obtained, create a clear path to the goal. If nearing the goal without the key, backtrack safely to collect it first.\n\n6. **Scoring Considerations**: If scoring is part of the strategy, consider the timing of interactions with mushrooms while maintaining the avatar's safety.\n\nBy applying these strategies thoughtfully, a player can effectively navigate through the level, achieve their objectives, and secure a win!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwithkey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

My current action should be to move to the left (position (1, 1)) to reach the goal.\n\n### Action Decision\nI will perform the action to move left:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should successfully take my avatar to the goal sprite and thus achieve the win condition. I expect to see my avatar collect the goal sprite and win the game.",
