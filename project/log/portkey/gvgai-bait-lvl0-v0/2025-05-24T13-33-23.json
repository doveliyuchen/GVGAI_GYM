    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThe game resembles a puzzle/platformer genre where the player navigates through a level, interacting with various sprites to achieve specific goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of several types of sprites, including the avatar (player), walls, holes (which can be fatal), keys (for unlocking goals), boxes (which can be pushed), mushrooms (that adversely affect the player), and the goal (an endpoint that requires a key).\n- **Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move around the level, with specific interactions that affect either the player or the environment. \n- **Interaction Rules**: The avatar can bounce back from walls, die if falling into holes, push boxes, collect keys from specific locations, and encounter mushrooms that affect its health/state.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal (a closed door) by acquiring a key within the level. The player must navigate obstacles while avoiding holes and harmful mushrooms.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal while possessing a key. \n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (by falling into holes or getting killed by mushrooms) or if they run out of avatars (if limited).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Explore and Collect**: Initially explore the level to locate the key and understand the layout. This helps in making an informed path to the goal.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Be very cautious around holes and mushrooms. Avoid jumping into holes and try not to collide with mushrooms unless absolutely necessary.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Utilize the boxes to navigate around the level, push them to possible goals or to create paths that keep you safe from holes.\n\n4. **Key Management**: Once the key is acquired, prioritize reaching the goal. Avoid other hazards when you have the key, as losing it from an unfortunate encounter could lead to extra hurdles.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves**: Always think ahead about your next move, especially in tight spots. Make sure that interactions with boxes, walls, or other hazards do not lead you to fall into a hole.\n\n6. **Learn from Mistakes**: If you encounter a game-over situation (i.e., losing an avatar), analyze what led to it and adjust strategies accordingly for subsequent attempts.\n\nBy optimizing movement, avoiding hazards, and using items strategically, players can maximize their chances of successfully completing the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
