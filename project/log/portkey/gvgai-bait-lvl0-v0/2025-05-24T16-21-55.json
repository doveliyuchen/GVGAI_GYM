    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to fall into the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players must navigate through obstacles and interact with various sprites (objects) to achieve an objective, which requires both problem-solving and platforming skills.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game features multiple types of sprites, including the player avatar, walls, holes, mushrooms, keys, and goals.\n   - The player avatar is designated as \u201cMovingAvatar,\u201d indicating it can move throughout the game space.\n   - There are interactive elements, such as keys that change the avatar's state and boxes that can be pushed or interacted with.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player can interact with walls (which will push them back), holes (which can lead to a game over), and boxes (which can bounce the avatar).\n   - Collecting a key transforms the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\", allowing interaction with the goal sprite.\n   - Some interactions can result in score changes, indicating that collecting certain items is beneficial.\n\n3. **Game Objects:**\n   - **Goals:** The primary objective, represented by a door that requires the avatar to be in a specific state (having a key) to pass through.\n   - **Box:** Can affect movement and has a crucial role in puzzle-solving.\n   - **Key:** Essential to transform the avatar into a state that allows it to reach the goal.\n   - **Mushroom:** Provides a score increment but also results in the avatar's elimination upon contact.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards such as holes and interactions that result in the avatar's death, thus limiting the number of allowed avatar sprites (lives).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- You win by eliminating the goal sprite when you have the key (which gives a score change of 5).\n- You lose if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, primarily due to falling into holes or engaging with hazardous sprites like the mushrooms.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Focus on avoiding the hole and mushrooms as they will lead to losing lives.\n   - Be cautious of wall interactions that might push you back at critical moments.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Ensure you collect the key to change your avatar into the \"withkey\" state. This is essential for interacting with the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:**\n   - If there are any boxes in the environment, use them to navigate around obstacles. They can help in creating safe paths since they bounce the avatar forward.\n\n4. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Carefully consider each move you make and plan out your route to minimize encountering hazards. \n\n5. **Score Management:**\n   - Score-changing interactions are available. Engaging with the mushroom when conditions are safe may help in increasing your score, but assess the risks.\n\nBy mastering interactions and controlling your movements, you can effectively navigate through the game while keeping your avatar safe and ultimately reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

The available keys are in positions (4, 2) with the key floor represented by '$'.\n\n1. The immediate goal is to collect the key at (4, 2) since, without it, the avatar cannot interact with the goal at (1, 1).\n2. I will determine the direction I need to move to collect the key first, and then analyze subsequent moves.\n\nBased on my current position (3, 2), I can move:\n\n- Up (2, 2) - this leads to a clean floor (.)\n- Down (4, 2) - this leads to the key ($)\n- Left (3, 1) - this also leads to a clean floor (.)\n- Right (3, 3) - this is also a clean floor (.)\n\nSince I need to collect the key to reach the goal, the best action is to move Down to (4, 2).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows me to collect the key. I expect to see my state change to 'withkey' (able to progress to the goal).",
