    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer that focuses on exploration and problem-solving.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** These include walls, holes, the floor, and the goal.\n   - **Movable Avatar:** The player controls an avatar that can interact with other sprites.\n   - **Passive Items:** Key, boxes, and mushrooms that play specific roles in gameplay.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can move over some objects and is obstructed by walls.\n   - Falling into a hole results in the avatar's death.\n   - Boxes can be bounced off, and can affect others (like killing one another by falling into a hole).\n   - Keys are essential; when the avatar has a key, it can access the goal (converting from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n   - The avatar must avoid certain objects (like mushrooms) that result in penalties.\n\n3. **Score System:**\n   - Points can be scored by interacting with specific objects like holes (1 point) and possibly other actions tied to objectives.\n   - The final goal gives a significant score change (5 points), rewarding completion.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of the game is to reach the goal using a key while avoiding death (and score penalties) from obstacles and enemies. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game is won when there are no goal sprites remaining, implying the player has successfully reached the goal with a key.\n- The game is lost if the player\u2019s avatar is reduced to zero (death).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Explore and Assess:**\n   - Begin by carefully analyzing the level layout to understand where the key is located. Identify potential hazards (like holes and mushrooms).\n\n2. **Acquire the Key:**\n   - Work strategically to reach the key, ensuring to avoid walls and hazards that lead to death.\n\n3. **Avoid Penalties:**\n   - Be cautious around mushrooms and other sprites that might cause the avatar to die. Minimize unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Leverage Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes strategically to bounce off walls or manipulate their positions to avoid hazards. If boxes can be used to cover holes, it could help in navigating the area safely.\n\n5. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - After acquiring the key, navigate toward the goal, ensuring to make direct paths and avoid backtracking unless necessary.\n\n6. **Use Walls to Your Advantage:**\n   - Use walls and the bouncing mechanics to navigate around the map, especially in tight areas where hazards are present.\n\nBy following these strategies, players will improve their chances of successfully completing the level by reaching the goal with a key while avoiding loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
