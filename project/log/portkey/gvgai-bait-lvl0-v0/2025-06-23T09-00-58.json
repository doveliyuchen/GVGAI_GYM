Players navigate through a level filled with obstacles and interactable objects while aiming to complete specific objectives (e.g., reaching a goal).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites:** The game features different types of sprites, including movable avatars and immovable decorations. Key components include:\n  - **Avatar:** The player's representation, which can move around the level.\n  - **Goal:** An exit point that must be reached to win the game.\n  - **Keys:** Used to unlock the goal; the player starts as 'nokey' and must obtain the 'key.'\n  - **Boxes and Mushrooms:** Objects that can impact the avatar\u2019s movement and score.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes and interact with walls.\n  - Falling into holes results in instant failure.\n  - Collecting the key transforms the player's state from 'nokey' to 'withkey,' allowing access to the goal.\n  - Hitting the goal without the key results in a setback.\n  - Various objects can also grant or deduct points.\n\n#### Objective:\n- The primary goal is to reach the goal sprite while collecting the key.\n- The player must avoid falling into holes or getting killed by mushrooms, which affects score and potentially leads to losing the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully navigating the level and reaching the goal sprite with the 'withkey' state.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar's count reaching zero (characters killed). This can happen by falling into holes or having mishaps with the mushrooms or other environmental dangers.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Careful Navigation:**\n   - Begin by exploring the map, noting where the key and other interactable objects are located. Avoid holes and mushrooms early on to maintain your avatar's count.\n\n2. **Key Acquisition:**\n   - Start by moving toward the 'key' sprite. Once you collect the key and transform into 'withkey,' your immediate priority is to reach the goal.\n\n3. **Use of Obstacles:**\n   - Utilize boxes effectively. They can bounce the avatar and can sometimes be used to clear problematic areas or reach otherwise inaccessible spots.\n\n4. **Plan for Risks:**\n   - Assess potential risks when navigating toward the goal, especially if you have the 'nokey' state, as returning from the goal area could be perilous.\n\n5. **Point Management:**\n   - Be strategic about your interactions with mushrooms to minimize penalties. Take calculated risks when engaging with them to prevent losing the game.\n\nIn summary, success in this game relies heavily on careful movement, planning around interactions, and strategic avoidance of hazards while seeking the key and reaching the goal quickly and efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",

    "content": "To begin analyzing the current game state, let\u2019s break down the relevant details:\n\n- Avatar position: `(2, 2)` (where the avatar is represented by `%`).\n- The key (`$`) is located at `(4, 2)`.\n- The goal (`#`) is located at `(1, 1)`.\n- Surrounding tiles include walls (`&`), empty floor (`.`), a box (`@`), and there\u2019s no hole (`0`) in proximity to the avatar's position.\n\n### Considering the Strategy:\n1. The immediate aim is to acquire the key first, as reaching the goal without it won\u2019t result in a win.\n2. Since the goal is at `(1, 1)`, we must first navigate to the key at `(4, 2)`.\n3. The path from `(2, 2)` to `(4, 2)` is clear: the avatar can move down to collect the key.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nBased on the presented strategy and current position, the appropriate action is to move **down** to `(3, 2)`.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aims to snake towards the key without hitting walls or hazards. I expect to be in a better position to access the key on the next move.",
