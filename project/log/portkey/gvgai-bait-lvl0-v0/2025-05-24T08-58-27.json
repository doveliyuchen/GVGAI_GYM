    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer** genre, combining elements of puzzles with interactive platforming mechanics. Players must navigate through a two-dimensional space while solving puzzles to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - **Avatar**: The primary character controlled by the player.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers that cause the avatar to step back upon contact.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous areas causing the avatar's death upon contact.\n   - **Keys**: Items that the avatar can collect; they come in two forms: without a key (nokey) and with a key (withkey).\n   - **Goals**: The endpoint that the player must reach to win, but it can only be accessed once the avatar has obtained a key.\n   - **Boxes and Mushrooms**: Obstacles that can be moved or interacted with to solve puzzles.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can either die in certain circumstances (e.g., colliding with holes or mushrooms) or be transformed when interacting with keys.\n   - Keys are crucial for reaching the goal; players need to collect them to progress.\n   - Boxes can be pushed or used to manipulate the environment, affecting obstacles and allowing navigation around the map.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends in a win if the goal sprite is cleared (when the withkey sprite reaches the goal).\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar sprite is reduced to zero before achieving the goal.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the level, collect the keys, and reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards and navigating obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Achieve the goal with the withkey sprite while ensuring the avatar survives.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar's sprite count reaches zero (either by losing to holes or mushrooms), the player loses the game.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Identify the locations of the walls, holes, boxes, keys, and goal in relation to your starting position.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious when navigating around holes and mushrooms, as they can kill the avatar. Plan your movements to bypass these threats.\n\n3. **Key Collection**: Your first priority should be to transform from the nokey sprite into the withkey sprite by acquiring the key. Keep track of the key's location to ensure you can access it safely without running into hazards.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Efficiently**: Leverage the boxes to manipulate your environment. They can help you avoid holes and potentially form a path to reach the goal.\n\n5. **Plan Moves Before Acting**: Always consider the results of your actions. For example, pushing a box can change the configuration of the obstacles, so visualize the outcome before moving.\n\n6. **Stay Safe**: If unsure, take a step back instead of risking contact with deadly hazards. Patience can lead to clearer paths and better decision-making.\n\nIf practiced well, this approach should lead to achieving the win condition by reaching the goal successfully while keeping the avatar alive.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
