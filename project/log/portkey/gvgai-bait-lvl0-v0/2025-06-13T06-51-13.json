The presence of boxes, keys, and a goal strongly suggests this is a puzzle game where the player needs to manipulate the environment.\n\n**Objective:**  The ultimate goal is to eliminate all 'goal' sprites from the level.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The 'avatar' is the player character and can move around.\n*   **Immovable Objects:** 'floor', 'hole', 'mushroom', 'goal', and 'wall' sprites cannot be moved by the player.\n*   **Key Collection:** The player ('nokey' or 'withkey') can pick up a key ('key') and transform into 'withkey'. The player has to touch the key to pick it up.\n*   **Box Pushing:** The player can push boxes ('box'). Boxes bounce back if pushed against the wall, avatar, another box, or a mushroom.\n*   **Holes:** Falling into a hole ('hole') kills the player.\n*   **Key Usage:** The player needs the 'withkey' state to open the goal ('goal') and eliminate it.\n\n**Win Condition:** Eliminate all 'goal' sprites (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True).\n\n**Loss Condition:**  The 'avatar' sprite is eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False), usually by falling into a hole.\n\n**Scoring:**\n* Pushing a box into a hole: Score +1\n* Touching a mushroom: Score +1\n* Opening a goal with a key: Score +5\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: wall\n*   `g`: goal\n*   `A`: avatar ('nokey' starting state)\n*   `.`: floor\n*   `1`: box\n*   `k`: key\n\nThe level layout shows a small, confined space. The avatar starts near the goal but needs to find the key and then open the goal.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** Prioritize finding and collecting the key. The avatar transforms into the \"withkey\" state upon acquiring the key.\n2.  **Box Management:** Carefully plan box movements to avoid getting stuck or blocking the path to the key or goal. Avoid box-wall-box-mushroom configuration. Pushing the box into a hole is a good way to get rid of it and get some points.\n3.  **Hole Avoidance:**  Be extremely careful not to fall into any holes.\n4.  **Goal Opening:** After getting the key, return to the goal to open it.\n\nIn summary, this game is a Sokoban-style puzzle game with key collection, box pushing, and environmental hazards. The player must carefully plan their moves to collect the key, strategically move boxes (or push them into holes), avoid falling into holes, and ultimately open the goal to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nkey -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nbox key -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &",
