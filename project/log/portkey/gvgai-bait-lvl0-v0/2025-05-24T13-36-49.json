    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**  \nThe game can be classified as a puzzle platformer. Players navigate through levels with a character (the avatar) that must solve puzzles related to movement, interactions with various sprites, and reaching a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Movement:**\n   - The player controls an 'avatar' that can move around a grid-like level.\n   - The level consists of different sprites, including walls, holes (which kill the avatar if collided with), boxes (that can be bounced off), mushrooms (also lethal), a key (which transforms the avatar upon interaction), and a goal (a door that needs to be opened).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can\u2019t pass through walls and must step back if it collides.\n   - Falling into holes results in instant failure (the avatar is \"killed\").\n   - Boxes can be moved by the avatar, and if they fall into holes, both the box and the hole are removed from the play area.\n   - Collecting a key changes the avatar state so it can then unlock the goal.\n   - The goal can only be reached if the avatar has the key; otherwise, it results in a step back.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to navigate the level, collect the key, and then reach the goal (the door) to win. The player must avoid obstacles that can lead to the avatar\u2019s demise (like holes and mushrooms) while using strategic movements to interact with the boxes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - The player wins by reaching the goal (the door) with the avatar in the 'withkey' state. This also scores the player 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition:** \n  - The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is killed (falls into a hole or collides with a mushroom) or if the avatar count reaches 0.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding the Layout:**\n   - Study the level layout carefully. In this case, walls (w), goal (g), avatar (A), key (k), and other sprites should be identified.\n\n2. **Initial Movement:**\n   - Start by moving the avatar towards the key while avoiding walls and enemies (mushrooms and holes). \n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Push boxes strategically to get them into positions where they can act as barriers against holes or to use them to reach higher platforms if necessary.\n\n4. **Avoiding Lethal Sprites:**\n   - Always keep track of your surroundings. Don\u2019t approach mushrooms carelessly. Avoid stepping into holes as well.\n\n5. **Key Collection:**\n   - Make it a priority to collect the key as soon as it's safe to do so. Once you have the key, then head towards the goal.\n\n6. **Goal Management:**\n   - Once transformed into 'withkey' state, navigate to the goal (g). Make sure to plan your route to avoid going back unnecessarily while managing threats.\n\n7. **Practice Precision:**\n   - Since the game's mechanics depend on grid movement, make deliberate actions when moving to avoid missteps that could lead to a collision with lethal sprites.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding how the game mechanics work, players should be able to effectively navigate the levels while minimizing the risk of losing their avatar and thus achieve their objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
