It combines elements of exploration and problem-solving, often seen in games where players navigate levels to reach an objective while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Represents the ground the avatar can walk on.\n   - **Exit**: A designated point (green door) that allows the avatar to win the game.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, capable of moving around the level.\n   - **Trap**: Hazards (spikes) that will result in losing points if the avatar interacts with them.\n   - **Wall**: Blocks the path and requires the avatar to navigate around it.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar cannot proceed through walls; they must backtrack if they attempt to move into one.\n   - If the avatar reaches the exit, they gain points and meet a win condition.\n   - Interacting with traps results in losing points, indicating a penalty for touching hazardous areas.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends with loss if the avatar\u2019s count reaches zero (indicating no lives left), if the avatar contacts a trap without finding the exit, or if time runs out (1000 units).\n   - The game ends in victory if the avatar successfully reaches the exit point.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the exit while avoiding traps. The player must navigate through the level's layout, manage their movement, and avoid hazards to score points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Conditions**: Reach the exit (green door) while possibly earning points.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar's life count reaches zero (presumably by hitting traps too often).\n  - Time runs out without reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before making any moves, take a moment to observe the level layout. Identify the locations of walls, traps, and the exit. Determine the safest path to reach the exit.\n\n2. **Avoid Traps**: Be cautious when navigating the level. Since interacting with traps results in a penalty, slowly move near potential traps to dodge them effectively.\n\n3. **Utilize Walls Smartly**: Since walls can block your movement, use them to navigate around the level efficiently. If you hit a wall, analyze your choices and look for alternate routes.\n\n4. **Manage Time**: With a time limit, keep an eye on the clock while strategizing your moves. Don't rush, but don\u2019t linger too long in one area that might lead to time running out.\n\n5. **Keep Score in Mind**: Try to balance between quickly reaching the exit and avoiding traps to minimize points loss. Even if reaching the exit seems immediate, ensure you preserve your score by dodging traps effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, this game emphasizes strategic navigation, careful planning, and timing to reach the exit while mitigating penalties from traps.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit -> '@'\ntrap -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> $\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=12 -> $\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> $\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> a\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> $\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> $\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=8 -> $\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> $\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> $\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> $\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",
