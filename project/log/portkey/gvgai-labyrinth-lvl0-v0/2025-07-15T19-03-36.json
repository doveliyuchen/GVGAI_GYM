Players have to navigate and make decisions to avoid traps while trying to reach an exit.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game consists of different types of sprites: walls (which are immovable), traps (which are damaging), a moving avatar (the player character), an exit (which signifies completion), and the floor (which seems to be the navigable area).\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move around the level, encountering walls that force it to step back if contacted. Traps hurt the avatar and decrease the score upon contact, while touching the exit increases the score and ends the game positively.\n- **Score System:** The game has a scoring system that rewards players for reaching the exit and penalizes them for hitting traps.\n- **Limitations:** The game has a set time limit and conditions related to sprite counts (specifically, the avatar and exit), indicating that players must complete levels within certain parameters to win.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the level and reach the exit sprite (`exit`) while avoiding traps (`trap`). Successfully reaching the exit increases the player's score, whereas contact with traps decreases it. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - Successfully touch the exit sprite, which will increase the score and terminate the game positively.\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - If the avatar sprite count reaches zero, the player loses the game.\n  - If the timeout limit of 1000 is reached without reaching the exit, the player also loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Path:** Before moving, take a moment to analyze the level layout. Identify the locations of traps and the exit. Look for clear paths that minimize the risk of hitting traps.\n\n2. **Avoid Traps:** As traps negatively affect your score and are likely to hinder your advancement, proceed cautiously, especially near areas sparsely populated with walls.\n\n3. **Wall Navigation:** Use walls to your advantage by understanding that they will force the avatar backward upon contact. This mechanic can help you pivot and makewise moves away from traps.\n\n4. **Keep an Eye on Time:** Monitor the time limit closely. Ensure that you balance careful navigation with a sense of urgency to avoid hitting the time limit.\n\n5. **Score Consideration:** If your score goes negative due to hitting traps, you may need to reassess your strategy and focus primarily on reaching the exit rather than accumulating points. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe game presents an engaging combination of puzzle-solving and strategic planning as you navigate around traps to reach the exit. Understanding the mechanics and maintaining an awareness of your surroundings will be crucial to your success. With practice, you can develop a strong sense of the level layouts and the way traps are placed, leading to more efficient routes towards victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit -> '@'\ntrap -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> @\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> $\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> a\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> $\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> $\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> $\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=8 -> $\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> $\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> $\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> $\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> #\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",

This will allow your avatar to navigate directly toward the exit, and since there are no traps or walls blocking the path in that direction, it is a safe choice that aligns with the strategy of planning the shortest, safest route.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move should bring the avatar closer to the exit, leading to a potential win if no other obstacles appear.
