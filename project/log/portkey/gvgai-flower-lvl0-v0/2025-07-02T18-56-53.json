It can also be classified as a puzzle-based game, where players must navigate and interact with various items to earn points while avoiding negative interactions.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**:\n  - **Floor**: The base level through which the player moves.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move around the map.\n  - **Walls**: Barriers that the avatar cannot pass through and must navigate around.\n  - **Seeds and Flowers**: The seeds lead to flower spawns at varying cooldowns, and flowers are the key interactive elements that either kill the avatar or grant score points.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can interact with walls, and stepping into one will result in a step back.\n  - Different flower types can cause the avatar to \"die,\" but they also offer varying point values depending on the flower type interacted with (flower1 through flower4).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal of the game is to accumulate points by interacting with flower sprites while avoiding harmful interactions with the lower-level flowers. You have a total game time of 1500 units, during which you must navigate the level and score points effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: You can win if the time runs out (1500 units) without losing all your lives (indicated by the avatar's sprite counter reaching zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends in loss if the avatar is eliminated while there are no remaining lives.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Early Flowers**: Since interacting with flower1 results in death and no score, it is crucial to avoid these at all costs in the early stages of the game. Your main target should be higher-level flowers (flower2 to flower4).\n\n2. **Maximize Points**: Prioritize interactions with flower3 (3 points) and flower4 (10 points). These will help accumulate points quickly.\n\n3. **Movement and Navigation**: Plan your movements around walls strategically to minimize interactions with harmful flowers while maximizing encounters with beneficial ones. Use the cooldown periods of flower spawns to your advantage to avoid flower1 while waiting for higher-scoring flowers to come into play.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer while maximizing your score. If running out of time becomes a concern, focus on safe flower interactions instead of exploring every possibility, as surviving to the end is preferable to dying early.\n\n5. **Adaptability**: Be prepared to alter your strategies based on flower spawn patterns; the game mechanics suggest a level of randomness in flower appearance. Be flexible and ready to move away from lower-scoring options that may appear.\n\nBy understanding the layout and using the above strategies, players can enhance their chances of winning the game while maximizing scores effectively!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor seed -> 's'\nfloor flower1 seed -> '@'\nfloor flower2 seed -> '#'\nfloor flower3 seed -> '$'\nfloor flower4 seed -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> s\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> s\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> a\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
