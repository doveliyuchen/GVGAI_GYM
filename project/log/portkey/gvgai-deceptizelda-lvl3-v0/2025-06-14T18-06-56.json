The use of various sprites, including doors, keys, goals, and enemies, indicates a classic dungeon-crawling style.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Player Character (Avatar):** The player controls an avatar that can attack enemies with a sword.\n- **Enemies:** There are different types of enemies (quick, normal, slow), each with specific cooldowns and behaviors. The player needs to avoid or eliminate these enemies.\n- **Keys and Goals:** The game features 'smallgoal' and 'largegoal' doors which require keys to open:\n  - The 'smallgoal' can only be accessed with a key.\n  - The 'largegoal' also offers a score reward but can be accessed regardless of whether the player has a key, though it counts towards a win condition.\n- **Interactions:**\n  - Players gain points by defeating enemies and breaking vases.\n  - Keys can be transformed from a state where the player doesn't have a key to one where they do (from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to advance through the level by obtaining keys to access goals, defeating enemies to score, and avoid losing lives. Winning conditions are tied to destroying specific sprites (smallgoal and largegoal).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by destroying all required instances of 'smallgoal' and 'largegoal'.\n- The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore Tactically:** Approach the level cautiously, scouting for enemies and avoiding unnecessary confrontations. \n   \n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:** Focus on transforming from 'nokey' to 'withkey' to unlock the small goal as soon as possible. This will increase your score and reduce the number of barriers.\n\n3. **Engage Enemies Wisely:**\n   - Use your sword effectively to defeat enemies, aiming to minimize damage taken. Observe their patterns and strike when it's safe. \n   - Prioritize quick and easy kills first to boost your score while staying alert for the more dangerous enemies.\n\n4. **Utilize Obstacles and Walls:** Use the walls to your advantage to block enemy movements and control the battlefield. \n\n5. **Vase Destruction:** Break vases for additional points. It\u2019s quick and can help you accumulate score rapidly.\n\n6. **Manage Health Carefully:** Keep an eye on your avatar's health; retreat if necessary to avoid being killed by enemy attacks.\n\n7. **Score Accumulation:** Accessing 'largegoal' and defeating enemies should be balanced with risk versus reward. Aim for high-scoring opportunities while maintaining survivability in mind.\n\nBy following these strategies and using tactical decision-making, players can navigate through the level effectively, achieving higher scores and ensuring that they meet win conditions successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nkey sword -> 'm'\nsword withkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

The notable elements in the immediate surroundings are:\n\n- At (10, 11), there is a \"smallgoal\" represented by '&'. \n- At (8, 11), there is a \"largegoal\" represented by '#'.\n- On row 4, I have identified a \"monsterNormal\" (indicated by '$') at (4, 5). \n- There are also \"vases\" (represented by 'v') on multiple rows which can potentially be broken for additional points. \n\nBased on my analysis, my immediate priority is to interact with the \"smallgoal\" since I have a key and it's crucial for progressing through the level while also increasing my score. \n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move right to (10, 11), which should allow me to interact with the \"smallgoal\".\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action intends to access the \"smallgoal,\" aligning with the strategy of key utilization while advancing effectively through the level.",
