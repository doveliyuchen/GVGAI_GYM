It involves character movement, combat, and item collection.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Player Interaction**: \n   - The avatar can interact with various objects and enemies through specific actions like attacking with a sword, collecting keys, and triggering goals.\n   - The player can transform from one sprite state (without a key) to another (with a key) by interacting with the key.\n\n2. **Enemy Mechanics**: \n   - Enemies are classified based on speed (Quick, Normal, Slow) and have cooldown times for their movement or attack patterns.\n   - Combat involves the avatar attacking enemies, which can result in gaining or losing scores depending on the situation.\n\n3. **Collection Mechanics**:\n   - Collectibles like keys and goals (both small and large) contribute to the player\u2019s score and ultimate success.\n\n4. **Goals**:\n   - Small goals yield a score of +1 and can be achieved with a key only.\n   - Large goals provide a substantial score of +10, accessible whether the player has a key or not.\n\n5. **Map Layout**:\n   - The level design includes walls, movable walls, and open spaces where the player can navigate, collect items, and engage enemies. The maze-like structure necessitates strategy in movement.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective for the player (the avatar) is to navigate through the level, defeat enemies, collect keys to transform and access goals, and ultimately reach the win condition specified (killing all small goals or large goals).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**: The game is won if the player collects all small goals (spriteCounter of 'smallgoal' reaches a certain number) or all large goals.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar's spriteCounter reaches a count of zero (indicating the avatar has been defeated).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement Planning**: Carefully navigate the maze while avoiding enemies when necessary. Observe the movement patterns of enemies and choose the right time to engage or evade.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Prioritize collecting keys, as they are vital for accessing small goals. Use your sword effectively to combat enemies but be aware of its limitations.\n\n3. **Focus on Goals**: Identify the location of both small and large goals early in the game to strategize your movements. Collect goals systematically to maximize your score.\n\n4. **Scoring Focus**: Since killing enemies provides score penalties or bonuses, evaluate the risk versus reward of engaging with them. If an enemy can cause you to lose score, consider avoiding them and focusing on targets that help achieve your goals.\n\n5. **Power Progression**: Transforming from \u2018nokey\u2019 to \u2018withkey\u2019 is crucial. Make it a priority to find and collect keys to enable access to more goals and defeat enemies effectively.\n\nBy combining careful movement, strategic goal collection, and efficient enemy engagement, players can succeed in achieving a high score while working towards the game\u2019s win conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nlargegoal monsterNormal -> 'n'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> n\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> m\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",
