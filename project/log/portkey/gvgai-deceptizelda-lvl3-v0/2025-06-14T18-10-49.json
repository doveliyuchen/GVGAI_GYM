The presence of avatars, enemies, collectibles (keys, goals), and combat suggests that players navigate a maze-like environment while facing challenges and making strategic choices.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Player Character (Avatar):** The player controls an avatar that can move, attack, and interact with various objects.\n- **Enemies:** Different types of enemies (Quick, Normal, Slow) present varying levels of challenge, each with cooldowns and specific behaviors. \n- **Goals and Keys:** The presence of two types of goals (small and large), each requiring a specific key (colored orange in this case), creates a clear objective for the player. Collecting keys transforms the 'nokey' state into a 'withkey' state, allowing for more interactions.\n- **Combat and Interaction:** The avatar can attack enemies and certain objects (like the vase). Successful interactions can yield score changes or trigger transformations.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- **Primary:** The player needs to collect keys to unlock goals and ultimate score points.\n- **Secondary:** Defeating enemies and collecting items to improve score.\n- Ultimately, the player must manipulate their space strategically while avoiding loss conditions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game is won if either:\n  - All small goals are collected.\n  - All large goals are collected.\n- The game is lost if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Collect Keys Early:**\n   Focus on collecting keys as early as possible, as they are essential for accessing the goals and enhancing your ability to score. \n\n2. **Engage Enemies Wisely:**\n   Since defeating enemies grants additional points, strategically engage them. Use the sword to defeat enemies while avoiding unnecessary risks.\n\n3. **Utilize Game Mechanics:**\n   - Use the transformation mechanic effectively; when you encounter a key, minimize risk by being aware of nearby enemies to avoid being killed.\n   - Interact with the vases to gain points and the enemies only if you are confident you won't get hit.\n\n4. **Map Awareness:**\n   Keep track of the map layout and enemy locations. Use walls and corners to your advantage when navigating or fleeing from enemies.\n\n5. **Prioritize Goals:**\n   Remember that both the small and large goals yield score changes but prioritize large goals for maximum impact. \n\n6. **Plan Movements:**\n   Make careful movements and plan out routes that allow you to collect keys and avoid getting surrounded by enemies.\n\n7. **Defensive Strategy:**\n   If you're low on health or overwhelmed by enemies, focus on defense. Retreat if necessary to avoid a loss.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and leveraging the game's mechanics effectively, a player can navigate the challenges present in the game, aim for high scores, and achieve a successful outcome.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> m\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To determine the most effective action based on the current state of the game and the strategies provided:\n\nFrom the game state, the avatar (denoted as 'a') is currently in row 10, col 10 where it has access to a key (represented as 's') in the same position. This means the avatar is already in a 'withkey' state and can interact with any collectibles around it. \n\nAdditionally, there is a small goal (represented as '&') directly to the right of the avatar in row 10, col 11. This allows for the opportunity to collect that small goal immediately. Prioritizing goal collection aligns with the suggested strategy of collecting keys and engaging with goals.\n\nSince we need to maximize our score by collecting goals, the best action to take now is:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n  \nThis action will move the avatar to the right where the small goal is located. I expect to collect the goal, gain points, and continue to progress towards maximizing the total score.",
