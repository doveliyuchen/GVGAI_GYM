    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the description provided, this game appears to fit into the **action-adventure** or **top-down dungeon crawler** genre. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the game's rules and mechanics:\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites** represent various elements in the game, including the player (avatar), enemies, goals, keys, and walls.\n- The player controls the avatar, which can interact with the environment using a sword to eliminate enemies and obtain keys.\n- **Movable walls** and **immovable walls** create obstacles in the level, influencing movement and strategy.\n- There are two types of goals: **smallgoal** and **largegoal**, which provide different scoring opportunities when interacted with in specific states (with or without keys).\n- **Enemies** exist with varying speed and cooldowns, representing monsters that the player must combat or avoid.\n- The player collects **keys** to unlock doors and access goals, influencing the gameplay flow and progression.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to collect keys and unlock the small and large goals to score points.\n- The player must ensure the avatar remains alive while defeating enemies, collecting items, and reaching the goals.\n- Interaction with sprites (e.g., defeating enemies grants points) and successful transformations (such as obtaining a key) are crucial for progressing in the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if they successfully accumulate enough points by interacting with the small and large goals.\n- Specifically, the game concludes in a win if the conditions involving the **SpriteCounter for smallgoal** or **largegoal** are met (indicating a successful outcome).\n- The player loses if the **SpriteCounter for avatar** reaches a certain condition indicating the avatar\u2019s defeat (meaning it cannot accumulate points or move forward).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Stay Mobile**: Keep your avatar moving to avoid enemy attacks while positioning yourself for effective strikes.\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection**: Focus on collecting keys to unlock the large and small goals since they significantly contribute to your score.\n3. **Combat Wisely**: Identify which kinds of enemies are on the field and prioritize defeating them for bonus points while being cautious of damage to your avatar.\n4. **Plan Your Path**: Use the layout to your advantage, identifying areas where you can safely collect items or engage enemies without getting cornered.\n5. **Maximize Points**: Aim to unlock the large goals as they yield higher scoring opportunities (10 points each) while also capitalizing on opportunities to fight enemies and interact with vases for additional points.\n\nBy understanding the layout of the level and effectively managing interactions, you can significantly increase your chances of winning while minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nlargegoal monsterNormal -> 'n'\nkey sword -> 's'\nwithkey -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> n\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, let's summarize our position and the available actions:\n\n- The player avatar has the ability to move around the grid to interact with items such as keys and goals.\n- I currently have a key (indicated by 'b') and there is a small goal (indicated by '&') located at (10, 11).\n- Nearby enemies in my vicinity are denoted by '$', specifically at (3, 11) and (6, 11), but they don't seem to be a direct threat at the moment since they are not on my current row or column.\n\n### Avatar Position:\n- Assuming the player's avatar is currently at (10, 10) based on the presence of the key 'b'.\n\n### Evaluation of Goals:\n- The small goal '&' is directly adjacent to my current position at (10, 11).\n- Consequently, to score points by interacting with this goal, the best course of action is to move right into the position of the small goal.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven that my avatar is positioned at (10, 10) and I can move right to interact with the small goal:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy of prioritizing goal interactions to maximize points. I expect to successfully score by reaching the small goal and thus continue advancing in the game.",
