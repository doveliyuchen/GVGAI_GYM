    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the **action-adventure** genre, with elements of puzzle-solving and resource management. Players must explore the environment, engage enemies, and acquire keys to progress.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Player Control**: The player controls an avatar that can move around the level and interact with various sprites (objects).\n2. **Combat**: The avatar can use a sword to defeat enemies and destroy certain objects in the game.\n3. **Goal Interaction**: Goals (small and large) can yield different points depending on whether the avatar possesses a key.\n4. **Enemy Encounters**: The game features different types of enemies with varying speeds and cooldowns, requiring players to strategize their interactions.\n5. **Key System**: Keys are necessary to unlock certain goals, and they can be acquired by transforming a sprite through interaction.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to score points by interacting with the goals and defeating enemies. The player can win by either fulfilling the conditions related to the small goals, large goals, or the avatar itself.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The player wins if they interact with enough `smallgoal` sprites or at least one `largegoal`.\n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - The game ends with a loss if the `avatar` is defeated (sprite counter for `avatar` reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Keep track of keys and decide when to use them. Prioritize acquiring the key first to unlock the high-value goals (`largegoal`).\n2. **Enemy Engagement**: Only engage with enemies when necessary, as being attacked by an enemy can decrease your chances of winning. Plan your movements to avoid accidental encounters.\n3. **Exploration**: Explore the environment carefully to discover hiding places for keys and goals without running into enemies unnecessarily. \n4. **Combat Wisely**: Use the sword strategically against enemies to increase your score without putting your avatar at risk of defeat. \n5. **Goal Optimization**: Focus on achieving interaction with goals that provide the highest score while ensuring your avatar remains safe. Target `largegoal` first if you have a key.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires a blend of strategy in exploration, resources (keys), and combat. Success hinges not only on defeating enemies but also on wisely choosing interactions with goals based on your current resources. Planning your route to maximize your score while avoiding damage is key to winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nwithkey -> 'm'\nsmallgoal sword -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> $\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> m\nrow=10, col=11 -> s\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",
