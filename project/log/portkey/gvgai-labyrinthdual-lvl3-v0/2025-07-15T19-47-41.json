The elements suggest a combination of spatial problem-solving with action elements where players navigate through a map filled with various types of walls, traps, and transformations.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game features different sprites, including walls (normal, red, blue), traps, and a moving avatar that changes form based on interactions with specific resources (redcoat and bluecoat).\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the level but has restrictions based on the type of walls. The player must be careful to avoid traps that can result in a score penalty.\n- **Transformation**: The avatar can collect coats (red and blue) that allow them to transform into different forms, potentially granting access to different game areas or increasing their score.\n  \n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the exit sprite while overcoming traps and walls. The player needs to collect coats to transform their avatar which may be necessary to progress through the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the player controls the avatar to reach the exit sprite. Additionally, there should be no avatars left on the screen by the time the exit is reached.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar counter reaches zero (indicating that the player has lost all avatars) or the timeout of 1000 units is reached without reaching the exit.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Take time to understand the layout of the level. Avoid traps and learn the positions of walls that impede movement.\n\n2. **Utilize Transformations Wisely**: Collect the red and blue coats judiciously. Transformations likely cater to specific sections of the level, so plan when and where to use them carefully.\n\n3. **Manage Scoring**: Pay attention to score changes from interactions. Try to maximize score by reaching the exit without losing avatars to traps.\n\n4. **Plan Movement**: Due to the step-back interactions with certain walls, always look for alternative routes and be cautious in movements to avoid getting trapped.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Navigate through the level efficiently to maximize your chances of reaching the exit before the time runs out.\n\nBy integrating exploration, smart resource management, and time management, players can optimize their chances of successfully navigating through the game's challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nblueWall -> '@'\nbluecoat -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nnormalWall -> '%'\nredWall -> '&'\nredcoat -> '*'\ntrap -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=5 -> &\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> %\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> %\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> %\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> @\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> %\nrow=5, col=7 -> %\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> %\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> %\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> %\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=15 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> %\nrow=9, col=3 -> %\nrow=9, col=4 -> %\nrow=9, col=5 -> %\nrow=9, col=6 -> %\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> %\nrow=9, col=9 -> %\nrow=9, col=10 -> %\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> %\nrow=9, col=14 -> %\nrow=9, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=11, col=0 -> %\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> %\nrow=11, col=3 -> %\nrow=11, col=4 -> %\nrow=11, col=5 -> %\nrow=11, col=6 -> %\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> %\nrow=11, col=9 -> %\nrow=11, col=10 -> %\nrow=11, col=11 -> %\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> %\nrow=11, col=14 -> %\nrow=11, col=15 -> %\nrow=12, col=0 -> %\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> b\nrow=12, col=15 -> %\nrow=13, col=0 -> %\nrow=13, col=1 -> %\nrow=13, col=2 -> %\nrow=13, col=3 -> %\nrow=13, col=4 -> %\nrow=13, col=5 -> %\nrow=13, col=6 -> %\nrow=13, col=7 -> %\nrow=13, col=8 -> %\nrow=13, col=9 -> %\nrow=13, col=10 -> %\nrow=13, col=11 -> %\nrow=13, col=12 -> %\nrow=13, col=13 -> %\nrow=13, col=14 -> %\nrow=13, col=15 -> %",

    "content": "To determine the next action, let's analyze the current state and the available options.\n\n1. **Understanding the Game State**:\n   - The avatar's position is initially unknown as it isn't provided but should be inferred based on where potential transformations and movements can occur relative to traps and walls.\n   - The immediate grid contains various elements, including walls, traps, and coats. Specifically:\n     - There are many walls represented by `%`, `@`, `&`.\n     - Traps are present at certain positions marked as `b`.\n     - The red and blue coats are indicated by `*` and `#`, respectively.\n     - The exit is located at `(7, 14)` marked as `$`.\n\n2. **Current Location and Navigation**:\n   - The exit at `(7, 14)` is two rows below the row `5`, but we must navigate through potential walls and traps to get there.\n   - The walls denote paths that can and cannot be traversed. We have to be cautious of traps as they can decrease our avatar count.\n\n3. **Quick Analysis of Surrounding Tools**:\n   - The red coat at `(3, 3)` can transform the avatar; the blue coat at `(8, 5)` can also be collected.\n   - Movable paths through normal and red walls need to be found, and every move must be purposeful to avoid traps.\n\n4. **Initial Moves**:\n   - Considering the traps located at rows 5 and 7 nearby potential routes to the exit, we must avoid direct paths that lead to these traps while heading toward the coats or directly toward the exit.\n\nGiven the aforementioned details, let's choose an action based on the surrounding walls and traps. \n\n**Action Decision**:\nMovement to the right `(ACTION_RIGHT)` toward `(1, 1)` seems to be a safe bet since the area seems less crowded with traps and will allow further options to reach the exit and potential coats.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of exploring while ensuring I navigate toward the exit effectively without hitting traps on my next turn.",
