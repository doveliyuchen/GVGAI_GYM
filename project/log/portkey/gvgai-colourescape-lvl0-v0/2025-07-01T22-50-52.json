It features elements of exploration with an emphasis on solving spatial and logical challenges using various game elements and mechanics.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game includes various sprites such as the avatar, boxes, switches, and obstacles (like walls and holes). Each sprite has specific interactions:\n   - **Avatar Transformations:** The player can change their avatar's type (normal, red, blue, green) by interacting with corresponding switches.\n   - **Box Interactions:** Depending on the color of the avatar, interacting with colored boxes affects their movement (bounds forward) or can lead to undoing prior actions.\n   - **Exit and Hole:** The exit allows the player to win, while falling into a hole causes a negative score and leads to the loss of the avatar.\n   \n2. **Movement and Bouncing:** The avatars can bounce off different boxes based on their color, allowing for tactical movement decisions during gameplay.\n\n3. **Score and Timers:** The game introduces scoring mechanics where the player's score is affected by specific interactions (e.g., gaining score by reaching an exit vs. losing score when falling into a hole). There's also a timeout condition that will lead to a loss if the player does not complete the level in time.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the exit while navigating through obstacles and utilizing different box interactions effectively. Players must gather their strategy around transforming into different avatars to interact with colored boxes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they successfully reach the exit sprite (scoreChange=1).\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if:\n  - The number of avatars (SpriteCounter for avatar) reaches zero (score limits).\n  - The player runs out of time (timeout limit = 1500).\n  - The player loses an avatar by falling into a hole (scoreChange=-1).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Explore the Map Efficiently:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Use initial movements to access different areas and identify where the switches and exit are located.\n\n2. **Plan Transformations:** Use the color switches strategically:\n   - Check which switch transforms your avatar into a playable form that can effectively interact with nearby boxes.\n   - The ability to bounce forward or undo previous actions can be critical, especially when exploring near the exit or moving towards it.\n\n3. **Box Interactions:** Be cautious about box placements and the avatar's color interactions. \n   - Always determine which box to interact with based on your current avatar color and the resulting movement or ability to undo actions.\n\n4. **Avoid Death by Hole:** Keep an eye out for holes on the map. If you accidentally bump into one, it can negatively impact your score and lead to a loss of the avatar.\n\n5. **Time Management:** Keep a close watch on the timer to avoid the loss condition due to timeout. Prioritize reaching the exit as efficiently as possible while engaging with switches and boxes necessary for progress.\n\n6. **Trial and Error:** Don\u2019t hesitate to try different avatar interactions with boxes. Some may yield unexpected results that could be advantageous in solving the puzzles.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the levels within the game while maximizing their scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nnormalAvatar -> '*'\nredSwitch -> 'b'\nredbox -> 'e'\nwall -> 'h'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'r'\nblueAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> #\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> h\nrow=3, col=2 -> h\nrow=3, col=3 -> h\nrow=3, col=4 -> h\nrow=3, col=5 -> h\nrow=3, col=6 -> h\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> h\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> h\nrow=4, col=11 -> h\nrow=4, col=12 -> h\nrow=4, col=13 -> h\nrow=4, col=14 -> h\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=16 -> e\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> h\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> w\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> h\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> h\nrow=7, col=13 -> h\nrow=7, col=14 -> h\nrow=7, col=15 -> h\nrow=7, col=16 -> h\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> h\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",

Based on the map description, there is no indication that an avatar is currently placed on the board, as the only items present in the first few rows are either holes or the spaces not occupied by the avatar.\n\nOur strategy focuses on exploring the surroundings and identifying potential actions, particularly towards any switches or boxes.\n\nSince I don\u2019t see an avatar marker (`*`, `w`, `e`, etc.) in the current layout, I will take an initial action to gather information by moving to the open space near the existing spaces. The only movement option that seems available according to the map is moving right on the second row, as there are empty spaces nearby.\n\nGiven this understanding, I will proceed with this action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should move to the right, aiming to explore the area and interact with any potential game elements. My expectation is to reveal more information about the game layout or uncover other interaction points.",
