The presence of different sprite types and interactions indicates a focus on solving challenges to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different elements in the game, including avatars (player characters), boxes (which can be interacted with in multiple ways), switches (which change the avatar\u2019s state), and walls and floors (which dictate the movement and action boundaries).\n  \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can move and interact with boxes and switches.\n   - Box mechanics include bouncing forward when certain avatars interact with them, and undoing all progress for other combinations.\n   - Different colored boxes and switches allow the avatar to change form, altering how they interact with the environment.\n   - The player can fall into holes (which results in a loss of points) and exit the level (which results in a win).\n\n3. **Score and Transformation**:\n   - Transforming into different colored avatars affects how the player can interact with boxes, emphasizing strategic selection of forms based on obstacles.\n   - Death (falling into a hole) incurs a penalty, while reaching the exit earns points.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate through the level to reach the exit while avoiding hazards (like the holes), managing box interactions, and efficiently using the switches to transform into different avatars as necessary.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit sprite with an avatar (SpriteCounter for exit reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar sprite count reaches zero (indicating all avatars are lost).\n  - The time limit of 1500 units is exceeded.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understand Avatar Transformations**: Pay close attention to the switches that change avatars. Using the correct avatar when interacting with boxes can save time and prevent undoing progress.\n\n2. **Plan Movements Carefully**: It\u2019s crucial to plan your moves to avoid falling into holes. If you see a hole nearby, assess your interactions carefully to prevent penalties.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Effectively**: Learn the box mechanics. Some boxes will bounce specific colored avatars forward, so use these to your advantage to traverse longer gaps or reach higher platforms.\n\n4. **Manage Your Score**: Since falling into holes results in negative points, try to accumulate positive score by reaching the exit as soon as possible while minimizing penalties.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Strategically determine your route to reach the exit quickly, making use of all available interactions and transformations needed to bypass obstacles.\n\nIn summary, a successful approach in this puzzle platformer entails mastering the various avatar states, leveraging the unique properties of boxes, avoiding hazards, and efficiently finding the exit while managing time and score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nnormalAvatar -> '*'\nredSwitch -> 'b'\nredbox -> 'e'\nwall -> 'h'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'r'\nredAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> h\nrow=3, col=2 -> h\nrow=3, col=3 -> h\nrow=3, col=4 -> h\nrow=3, col=5 -> h\nrow=3, col=6 -> h\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> h\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> h\nrow=4, col=11 -> h\nrow=4, col=12 -> h\nrow=4, col=13 -> h\nrow=4, col=14 -> h\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=16 -> e\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> h\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> $\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> $\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> h\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> h\nrow=7, col=13 -> h\nrow=7, col=14 -> h\nrow=7, col=15 -> h\nrow=7, col=16 -> h\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> r\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> h\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game and the surrounding elements, let's analyze the situation:\n\n### Current Avatar Position\n- The avatar's current position is unknown. There are various floor types, switches, holes, and exit points scattered across the map that must be evaluated.\n\n### Map Layout Overview\n- There are multiple holes (`&`) and the exit point (`%`) on the map. The exit is located at `(1, 11)`.\n- There are also boxes (`$` and `#`) and switches (`@` for blue switches) positioned around, which could be useful for interactions.\n\n### Evaluation of Next Moves\n1. **Identify Nearby Interactions**: \n   - Key areas to consider are those near the exit, where the avatar could manipulate the environment to reach the exit point effectively.\n   - The bottom of the map contains multiple boxes, which could be moved to change the surrounding floor and facilitate access to the exit.\n\n2. **Plan Next Action**: \n   - If the avatar is close to any box or switch, the action should either be to interact with a box to create a path or move toward opening up possible routes leading to the exit.\n   - If current avatar actions lead to no progress, considering a movement to switch forms or to reposition the avatar should be done.\n\n### Initial Consideration for Action\n- Assuming the avatar is located in a position where further action could lead towards utilizing available boxes or switches, an optimal plan would involve navigating horizontally or vertically toward available interactive elements.\n\nGiven that the avatar has likely not changed position from the last observation, I will choose to move closer to potential interactions.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right may provide the opportunity to interact with nearby elements and evaluate further actions accordingly towards reaching the exit.",
