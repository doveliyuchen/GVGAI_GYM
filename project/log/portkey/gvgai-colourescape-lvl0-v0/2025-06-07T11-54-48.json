Players must navigate a series of obstacles, manipulate switches, and interact with various elements to progress through levels, ultimately solving puzzles to reach the exit.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Interactions**:\n  - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can interact with different elements in the game.\n  - **Blocks and Boxes**: These are movable elements that can affect the avatar and each other.\n  - **Switches**: Different switches transform the avatar into various colored forms (e.g., red, blue, green), which appear to have distinct interaction mechanics with the boxes.\n  - **Exit and Holes**: Players can reach the exit for a win, but falling into holes results in a loss.\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar interacts with specific colored boxes and switches to trigger different actions like bouncing forward or transforming into another avatar type.\n  - The game includes elements that can undo previous movements based on the avatar's interactions with certain boxes, which adds complexity to the puzzle-solving aspect.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the **exit** while navigating through the level. Players must solve puzzles involving boxes, switches, and possibly avoid traps like holes to successfully reach the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Successfully reaching and interacting with the exit grants a \"win\" state.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar falls into a hole (triggering a killSprite) or the timer runs out (timeout limit set to 1500), which results in a loss.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understand Sprite Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how different colored avatars interact with boxes and switches. Knowing which combinations allow for bouncing or other transformations can be critical for solving puzzles.\n\n2. **Plan Moves**: Diagram potential paths to the exit before executing moves. As some interactions can undo progress, careful planning can save time and prevent errors.\n\n3. **Utilize Switches Efficiently**: Switches are key to changing the avatar's type, enhancing the player's abilities to interact with specific boxes. Always consider which switch to activate first based on proximity to the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes**: Be cautious of moving too close to holes. Losing points reduces chances for productive gameplay; overcoming them is essential. Ensure paths are clear before making big moves.\n\n5. **Experiment**: If progress seems blocked, try different interactions with the blocks and switches, as certain combinations might yield unexpected results that can clear the way.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies and being methodical in interactions with the environment, players can effectively navigate through levels and reach the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nnormalAvatar -> '*'\nredSwitch -> 'b'\nredbox -> 'e'\nwall -> 'h'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'r'\nblueAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> #\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> h\nrow=3, col=2 -> h\nrow=3, col=3 -> h\nrow=3, col=4 -> h\nrow=3, col=5 -> h\nrow=3, col=6 -> h\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> h\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> h\nrow=4, col=11 -> h\nrow=4, col=12 -> h\nrow=4, col=13 -> h\nrow=4, col=14 -> h\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=16 -> e\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> h\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> h\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> h\nrow=7, col=13 -> h\nrow=7, col=14 -> h\nrow=7, col=15 -> h\nrow=7, col=16 -> h\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> h\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",
