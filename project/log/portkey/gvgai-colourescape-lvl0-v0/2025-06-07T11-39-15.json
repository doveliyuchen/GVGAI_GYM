Each transformation may have unique abilities or effects.\n3. **Interactivity:** Players can bounce off boxes, which may propel them forward or undo previous actions depending on which character they are using. The same applies to the relationships between boxes and the avatar.\n4. **Win/Loss:** Players can win by reaching the exit (`exit avatar`), while losing can occur if the avatar falls into a hole (`avatar hole`) or if they run out of lives due to losing all avatars (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0`).\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, avoid hazards (like holes), and reach the exit. To do so, players must use the various boxes and switches strategically.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win:** When the avatar reaches the exit, they gain points, and the game ends positively.\n- **Loss:** If the avatar loses all lives or runs out of time, the game ends negatively.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Know Your Sprites:** Understand how each sprite interacts. Some boxes can bounce your character forward, while others might undo your progress depending on the character's color.\n\n2. **Utilize Switches Wisely:** Switches transform your avatar into different types, which may be essential for overcoming obstacles in the level. Use them to adapt to challenges you face.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path:** Before making moves, study the layout. Identify the location of holes and the exit, and figure out how to navigate around them using the boxes.\n\n4. **Stay Away from Hazards:** Avoid the holes as they cause a loss in points and may lead to game termination. \n\n5. **Manage Time:** Since there is a timeout limit, move efficiently and prevent unnecessary delays.\n\n6. **Experiment with Bounces:** Use bouncing where applicable to reach higher areas or access hidden parts of the map that may lead to bonuses or shortcuts.\n\nWith careful execution of these strategies while remaining aware of the interactive mechanics, players can effectively navigate the challenges and achieve the game objectives successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nnormalAvatar -> '*'\nredSwitch -> 'b'\nredbox -> 'e'\nwall -> 'h'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'r'\nblueAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> h\nrow=3, col=2 -> h\nrow=3, col=3 -> h\nrow=3, col=4 -> h\nrow=3, col=5 -> h\nrow=3, col=6 -> h\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> h\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> h\nrow=4, col=11 -> h\nrow=4, col=12 -> h\nrow=4, col=13 -> h\nrow=4, col=14 -> h\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=16 -> e\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> h\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> $\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> h\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> h\nrow=7, col=13 -> h\nrow=7, col=14 -> h\nrow=7, col=15 -> h\nrow=7, col=16 -> h\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> h\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",

The avatar's position, commonly dictated as 'a', is currently not specified in the game state provided; therefore, without the avatar's defined location in the grid, I will assume it was not defined before the action decision context was provided.\n\n### Map Analysis\n- The map outlines a row and column structure filled with various entities including walls (h), an exit (%), holes (&), and boxes, along with switches that can transform the avatar.\n- Based on the description of the game, the only clear position of interest is where the exit is located (row 1, col 11, represented by %).\n- There are also several boxes and switches that may empower the avatar to traverse the level more effectively.\n  \n### Strategy Insight\n- The primary strategy focuses on utilizing the available boxes to navigate the terrain and avoid losing points by falling into holes.\n- Given the exit's location and multiple openings in the line of sight, we need to work toward positioning the avatar toward that exit.\n  \n### Available Actions\nBefore taking any action, we should be cognizant of the mechanics:\n1. **Rotate and Move:** Depending on the current orientation of the avatar, we might need to rotate to face the exit before proceeding.\n2. **Box Bouncing:** Utilizing the boxes could be crucial in circumventing hazards or gaining elevation.\n\nWith that said, to act towards winning, I would recommend:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action signifies moving right, which aligns with approaching the area containing the exit while carefully evaluating and utilizing any boxes or switches on the way. I expect this will allow the avatar to get closer to the exit and use the surrounding terrain effectively based on the strategy outlined.",
