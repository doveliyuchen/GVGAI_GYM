    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**, a mix that involves solving puzzles with strategic movement and object interaction, likely within a grid-based or tile-based environment.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Objects**:\n    - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can change colors.\n    - **Boxes**: Various types which affect interactions depending on the avatar's color. Different boxes have unique behaviors (e.g., \"bounce forward\" or \"undo all\").\n    - **Switches**: Changing the avatar\u2019s form based on interaction, allowing for potentially unique abilities or interactions with other objects.\n    - **Walls/Floors**: Immovable tiles that define movement boundaries.\n    - **Exit and Holes**: Exit leads to victory, while holes cause the avatar to lose points.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Interactions vary widely based on the object types involved. For example, certain boxes will only work with a specific colored avatar or will reset the game state if combined incorrectly.\n\n3. **Changing States**:\n   - The avatar can change color and capabilities based on which switch is activated. This is crucial for accessing different areas or overcoming specific challenges.\n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is to navigate through the level to the exit while maximizing the score. The player must interact correctly with the boxes, switches, and avoid entering holes to prevent loss of points or lives.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: Reaching the exit (green door) results in victory.\n- **Loss**: \n  - If the avatar dies by falling into holes, the score reduces.\n  - If the avatar count reaches 0 (either due to falling or other interactions).\n  - If the timer runs out, leading to a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how different box colors interact with different avatars. This knowledge is key for progressing through puzzles.\n   \n2. **Plan Movement**: Analyze pathways and potential obstacles ahead of time. Moving to specific tiles with the right avatar can give access to the exit or certain items.\n   \n3. **Manage Timer**: With a timeout limit, it\u2019s crucial to keep moving efficiently toward the exit. Avoid overly complicated strategies that may extend playtime unnecessarily.\n   \n4. **Utilize Switches**: Actively use switches to change your avatar into the correct type needed for various interactions. Switching at the right moment can create pathways to the exit or necessary items.\n   \n5. **Avoid Holes**: Always be mindful of your surroundings to prevent falling into holes which both reduce your score and can potentially lead to a reset in progress.\n\nBy strategizing effectively around the mechanics outlined, players can navigate through the challenges presented and successfully reach the exit while maximizing their score. Each level offers unique puzzles that require a mix of logic, quick thinking, and timing.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nnormalAvatar -> '*'\nredSwitch -> 'b'\nredbox -> 'e'\nwall -> 'h'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'r'\nredAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> h\nrow=3, col=2 -> h\nrow=3, col=3 -> h\nrow=3, col=4 -> h\nrow=3, col=5 -> h\nrow=3, col=6 -> h\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> h\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> h\nrow=4, col=11 -> h\nrow=4, col=12 -> h\nrow=4, col=13 -> h\nrow=4, col=14 -> h\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=16 -> e\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> h\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> h\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> h\nrow=7, col=13 -> h\nrow=7, col=14 -> h\nrow=7, col=15 -> h\nrow=7, col=16 -> h\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> h\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> $\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",

Moving sideways first can help avoid running into immediate obstacles.",
