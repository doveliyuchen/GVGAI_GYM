The combination of interacting elements and the need for strategic movement points towards a logic-based gameplay experience typical of the genre.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different sprites represent various elements in the game, such as blocks, walls, switches, and the avatar.\n- **Interactions**: The player can interact with different blocks to influence movement and transformation:\n  - **Boxes** (green, blue, red) act in specific ways depending on the avatar's color.\n  - **Switches** transform the avatar into different colored avatars, each with unique capabilities.\n  - **Holes** act as lethal traps that end the avatar's life, while the exit sprite provides a way to win.\n- **Movement and Transformation**: The player must navigate through the level while managing transformations to solve puzzles and reach the exit.\n  \n#### Objective\nThe main objectives of the game are:\n1. Navigate through the level to reach the **exit** while avoiding hazards (like holes and other traps).\n2. Utilize blocks and switches to solve puzzles and possibly change the avatar type.\n3. Ensure that the avatar does not run out of lives (sprite count limit).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**: \n  - Reach the exit sprite while navigating through the level.\n  - Successfully transform into the correct avatar types to interact with blocks effectively.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar runs out of lives (sprite count reaches zero).\n  - Time runs out before reaching the exit.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout and the location of the exit, switches, and holes. Take a mental note of where transformations are available.\n  \n2. **Use Switches Wisely**: Transform into the avatar that can interact effectively with the blocks you encounter. For example, if facing a blue box, you should be the blue avatar to bounce forward rather than undo all your progress.\n  \n3. **Plan Your Moves**: Avoid falling into holes by carefully planning your movements. Ensure that every action leads towards progressing towards the exit. \n   \n4. **Manage Time**: Keep track of the time limit. Prioritize reaching the exit over unnecessary interactions that could cost you time.\n  \n5. **Experiment with Blocks**: Some blocks have unique interactions with different avatars. If you cannot proceed with a current strategy, try changing avatars or revisiting any blocks you've encountered.\n\n6. **Avoid Unintended Consequences**: Be cautious of interactions that may result in losing all progress (like undoing all actions). This can quickly lead to a frustrating setback.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating through the puzzles while managing the avatar's transformations effectively to reach the exit safely.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nnormalAvatar -> '*'\nredSwitch -> 'b'\nredbox -> 'e'\nwall -> 'h'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'r'\nblueAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> h\nrow=3, col=2 -> h\nrow=3, col=3 -> h\nrow=3, col=4 -> h\nrow=3, col=5 -> h\nrow=3, col=6 -> h\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> h\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> h\nrow=4, col=11 -> h\nrow=4, col=12 -> h\nrow=4, col=13 -> h\nrow=4, col=14 -> h\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=16 -> e\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> h\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> h\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> h\nrow=7, col=13 -> h\nrow=7, col=14 -> h\nrow=7, col=15 -> h\nrow=7, col=16 -> h\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> h\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",
