Players will maneuver an avatar through a level filled with obstacles, utilizing interaction mechanics with objects to achieve the objective of reaching the exit.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: The background on which the gameplay occurs.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that moves and interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be used to manipulate the environment or block.\n   - **Exit**: A designated endpoint signified by a green door.\n   - **Hole**: A danger zone that prompts immediate failure upon contact.\n   - **Wall**: Impassable barriers that define the gameplay space.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce off walls or boxes, allowing for specific movement patterns.\n   - Interaction between the avatar and the exit allows the player to win, while contact with the hole results in instant failure.\n   - Boxes also interact with the wall and exit, suggesting they may be moved or used strategically to navigate the environment.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends negatively if the avatar is eliminated, if the timer runs out (timeout), or positively if the exit is reached.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the maze-like level to reach the exit green door. This must be done while avoiding holes and managing the placement of boxes to effectively navigate barriers in the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully reaching the exit before running out of time or losing the avatar.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar touches a hole or if the avatar's count drops to zero due to failures.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify where the holes are located and strategize routes that avoid these dangers.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use the boxes to navigate through walls. Bounce off walls if needed to reposition the boxes for further movement or create a path towards the exit.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Since the time limit is a critical factor, make every movement count. Observe patterns of potential threats or opportunities in the level before acting.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes**: Keep a safe distance from holes, as they immediately affect your score and can lead to defeat.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep track of time while solving the puzzle. Prioritize reaching the exit quickly to ensure the avatar remains intact.\n\nIn summary, play tactically, avoiding hazards while utilizing the environment to your advantage. Your success will depend on balancing exploration with swift movements towards the exit, all while managing interactions with boxes and walls.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> a\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
