    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules and level layout, here\u2019s a plain\u2010language breakdown of what the game is about and some ideas on how to approach it:\n\n\u2022 Game Type and Look:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game in the spirit of Sokoban-style puzzles. You control a moving avatar (a little rat, judging by the image) on a board filled with walls, boxes (block obstacles), holes (hazardous areas), and an exit (depicted as a piece of cheese).\n\u2003\u2013 The environment is composed of immovable walls and floors, while some objects (like the boxes) can be pushed or interact with your avatar.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u20031. Movement and Obstacles:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Your avatar moves around a grid. When it runs into a wall, it \u201csteps back\u201d (bounces back \u2013 you can\u2019t pass through walls).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Boxes are passive objects. However, if a box meets your avatar, there\u2019s a \u201cbounceForward\u201d reaction \u2013 this might mean that when you push or bump into a box, you\u2019re shoved further, so you have to plan your moves.\n\u20032. Special Interactions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If your avatar goes over a hole, the rule \u201cavatar hole > killSprite scoreChange=-1\u201d means that your character will be killed and you lose a point. So holes are deadly traps.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s an interaction \u201cexit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=1.\u201d Here, if your avatar meets the exit, it removes (or \u201ckills\u201d) the exit sprite, which, according to the win condition, wins the level. (It\u2019s a bit unusual to \u201ckill\u201d something on victory, but in this game, removing the exit signals success.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Boxes also interact with holes (\u201cbox hole > killSprite\u201d) so if a box accidentally falls into a hole, it disappears. This might be useful (or harmful) depending on how you plan your route.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s a slightly mysterious multi-sprite rule \u201cbox wall exit box > undoAll.\u201d Though ambiguous at first glance, it likely prevents certain unwanted arrangements (for example, a box jammed between a wall and the exit, or a conflict of objects) by essentially canceling moves that lead to this configuration. The rule may serve as a \u201csafety net\u201d to avoid unsolvable positions or force you to rethink your strategy.\n \n\u2022 Objective and End Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your overall goal is to reach the exit. In this game, making contact with the exit (while avoiding deadly holes) removes the exit sprite and results in a win.\n\u2003\u2013 You must be careful not to kill your avatar. Losing your avatar (for example, by falling into a hole) means a loss.\n\u2003\u2013 In addition, there is a timer: if you don\u2019t solve the puzzle in 1000 turns, the level ends unfavorably.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy Tips:\n\u20031. Think Ahead:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Since every move counts and the time limit is finite, plan moves in advance. Consider not only where your avatar goes, but also how pushing boxes might change the board.\n\u20032. Avoid Deadly Traps:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Holes should be treated as no-go zones for your avatar. Watch out that moves don\u2019t inadvertently send your avatar (or even useful boxes) into holes unless that is part of a deliberate strategy.\n\u20033. Use Boxes Wisely:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Boxes are obstacles that you may need to maneuver around. Their interaction \u201cbounceForward\u201d with the avatar might help you avoid certain hazards if timed correctly. However, be cautious\u2014if a box accidentally moves into a hole, you could lose critical moves.\n\u20034. Be Alert for Special Situations:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Keep an eye on the \u201cundoAll\u201d rule. This rule seems to cancel actions when boxes come into contact with walls or the exit in a certain pattern. It might mean that you have to rearrange boxes in a particular order or avoid forcing them into corners near the exit.\n\u20035. Balance Risk and Reward:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Because stepping on the exit gives you a point and wins the level while falling into a hole deducts a point (and kills you), take extra care near holes. Sometimes a precise push of a box or a careful step can clear your path to the exit.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re looking at a grid-based puzzle where you must navigate a rat-like avatar through a maze of walls, boxes, and holes to reach (and \u201cremove\u201d) the exit. The game tests your planning skills as you balance moving the avatar, handling boxes (which might bounce you off when in contact), and managing hazards like holes\u2014all under a move limit. By carefully planning your moves, avoiding traps, and understanding how objects interact, you can work toward solving the puzzle and securing a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> a\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
