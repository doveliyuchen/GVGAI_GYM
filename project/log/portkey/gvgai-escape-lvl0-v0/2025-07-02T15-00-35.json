You control an avatar (a rat, as seen in its graphic) that moves around on a tiled layout, interacts with movable boxes and static obstacles, and must ultimately reach an exit while avoiding deadly traps.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics\n\u2003\u2013 The playing field is built from different kinds of sprites:\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb Walls \u2013 These form solid barriers. The avatar cannot pass through them (if it bumps into a wall, it\u2019s forced to step back).\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb Floor \u2013 The \u201cinvisible\u201d background that doesn\u2019t interact but gives the level its base.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb Boxes \u2013 These are passive elements that the avatar can push. When an avatar contacts a box, the box \u201cbounces forward\u201d (slides further in the pushed direction). However, pushing them carelessly can lead to problems.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb Exit \u2013 This is portrayed like a piece of cheese (green door) and symbolizes your goal. When your avatar touches the exit, it triggers a kill event for the exit sprite (essentially \u201cusing\u201d it), awarding a score bonus and fulfilling the win condition.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb Holes \u2013 Dark blue portals. These are dangerous: if your avatar steps into one, the avatar is killed (with a penalty of \u20131 score). Interestingly, boxes that go into holes are simply removed.\n\u2003\n\u2003\u2013 There is one puzzling interaction noted as \u201cbox wall exit box > undoAll\u201d. Although a bit cryptic at first glance, it likely means that if boxes are pushed into a particular problematic configuration (involving contact with a wall and the exit together) the game will undo all recent moves \u2013 a hint that box placement must be handled with care.\n\n\u2022 Game Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: Guide your avatar from its starting point through the level to interact with the exit.\n\u2003\u2013 Win: The level is won when you remove (or \u201cuse up\u201d) the exit sprite (by having the avatar touch it). This is further backed up by a positive score change.\n\u2003\u2013 Loss: Several things can make you lose:\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb If your avatar is killed (by falling into a hole),\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb If you run out of time (there\u2019s a move limit of 1000), or \n\u2003\u2003\u25cb If, for some reason, your avatar count drops to zero.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy\n\u2003\u2013 Plan Your Moves: Because the avatar can\u2019t simply mosey through walls and dangerous holes, take your time to assess the layout. The grid is peppered with obstacles (boxes, walls, holes) in a fairly tight formation.\n\u2003\u2013 Be Careful with Boxes: Since pushing boxes causes them to \u201cbounce forward\u201d and because there\u2019s a penalty (or an \u201cundoAll\u201d action) if boxes get into certain configurations, think ahead before you nudge a box. Sometimes a box might need to be moved to clear a path or block a dangerous hole\u2014but avoid creating unsolvable traps.\n\u2003\u2013 Navigate the Dangers: Holes are deadly for your avatar. Keep a careful eye on them and don\u2019t let the boxes or your own movement inadvertently force you toward them.\n\u2003\u2013 Use the Exit Wisely: The exit isn\u2019t just a door; it carries your win condition. Setting things up so that your avatar can smoothly step on it without interference is key, even if that means repositioning boxes along the way.\n\u2003\u2013 Time is of the Essence: With a limited number of moves allowed, each step counts. Make efficient decisions and try to avoid unnecessary moves that could lead to a timeout.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re in for a thoughtful puzzle challenge where every push and step matters. Balancing safe navigation with precise moves to reposition boxes is the heart of succeeding in this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> a\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
