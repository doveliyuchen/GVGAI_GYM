    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nHere\u2019s a plain\u2010language breakdown of what\u2019s going on:\n\n\u2022 Genre & Feel:  \n\u2002\u2002It\u2019s a puzzle game with elements similar to classic box\u2010pushing challenges (think Sokoban) but with its own twist. You control a \u201crat\u201d (the avatar) on a grid filled with walls, boxes, holes, and a door (the exit).\n\n\u2022 Mechanics:  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 You move the avatar around a grid. The walls block your progress (the avatar \u201csteps back\u201d if it tries to go into one).  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 There are boxes scattered about that interact with you and the environment. For instance, if you bump into a box, it \u201cbounces forward,\u201d which might send it rolling a bit farther than expected.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 There are holes on the grid\u2014as hazards. If you accidentally move your avatar into one, you\u2019ll be killed (you lose a life or the game ends) and lose some points.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 The exit door (green and marked with a cheese-like image) is the goal. When your avatar reaches it, there\u2019s an interaction that \u201ckills\u201d (removes) the exit, which in this game is treated as a win condition that gives you a point.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 There\u2019s also a curious multi-object interaction noted (\"box wall exit box > undoAll\") that hints at some built-in puzzles. It suggests that if a box, wall, exit, and another box come together in a certain way, the game might reverse an action (an \u201cundo\u201d of the last move), so you have to be precise with your pushes and movements.\n\n\u2022 Objective & Win/Loss Conditions:  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 To win, you must cause the exit door to get \u201ckilled\u201d by having your avatar interact with it\u2014that is, safely reaching the exit.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 You lose if your avatar is removed (for example, by falling into a hole) or if you run out of moves/time (exceeding a 1000\u2010step limit).\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Plan your moves carefully. Since walls block movement and boxes react unpredictably (bouncing when colliding with you), think a step ahead.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Navigate carefully around holes; they\u2019re dangerous pits that instantly kill your avatar.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Use the boxes wisely. Figure out how your interactions might help or hinder you; for example, you might be able to shift a box to change the layout\u2014but be wary that mishandling them could trigger an \u201cundo\u201d of your progress.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 The primary goal is to reach the exit door without falling into any hazards. Each movement matters, so deliberate movements and making use of the bricks (boxes) may be key to unlocking the right path.\n\nIn short, you\u2019re solving a spatial puzzle: safely guide your avatar around hazards, use boxes to your advantage (or at least avoid them causing misfires), and reach the door to win before your moves run out. Enjoy planning and testing out your routes!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> a\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
