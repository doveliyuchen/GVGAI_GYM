    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game, likely Sokoban-inspired.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an 'avatar' (a rat). The avatar can move.\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar can push 'boxes'.  Pushing boxes into walls results in 'bounceForward' which likely means the avatar moves but the box doesn't.\n*   **Portals/Holes:** 'Holes' act as portals. If the player character falls into a hole, he dies.\n*   **Win Condition:** The player can reach the 'exit'. The game is also won when all 'exit' sprites are destroyed, suggesting a possible puzzle element where reaching exits might destroy them.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe primary objective appears to be to navigate the 'avatar' to the 'exit' (cheese) while avoiding the 'holes'.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:**\n    *   All 'exit' sprites are removed (likely by the avatar reaching them).\n*   **Loss:**\n    *   The 'avatar' count reaches 0 (likely by falling into 'holes').\n    *   The game times out (1000 time steps).\n\n**Sprites:**\n\n*   **Avatar (Rat):** Controlled by the player. Must reach the exit.\n*   **Box:** Pushable objects, likely used to create paths, block holes, or reach exits.\n*   **Exit (Cheese):** The goal.\n*   **Hole:** A hazard that kills the avatar if it falls in.\n*   **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   The level is small and likely represents a single puzzle.\n*   The level contains several '1' which represent the 'box' sprite.\n*   The starting location for the avatar 'A' is clearly marked.\n*   The locations of 'holes', 'walls', and the 'exit' are also clearly marked.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Box Placement:** The core mechanic revolves around strategically pushing boxes.\n2.  **Path Planning:** Carefully plan the avatar's movements to avoid holes and walls.\n3.  **Resource Management:**  Be mindful of the number of boxes and how they are used. Don't push boxes into corners from which they cannot be retrieved.\n4.  **Time Management:**  Avoid unnecessary moves to prevent timing out.\n5. **Abuse Undoing Mechanism:** Use the undo all to undo a specific action to benefit the avatar/boxes' location.\n\n**In summary,** this is a puzzle game about pushing boxes around a level to reach the exit while avoiding hazards. Success requires careful planning, spatial reasoning, and an understanding of the box-pushing mechanics.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> a\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
