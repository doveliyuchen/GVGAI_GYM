    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules and layout provided, this game can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game can be classified as a **puzzle/platformer**. It features elements of navigation, problem-solving, and obstacles, which are typical in such genres.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: There are various types of sprites, including walls, boxes, holes, an exit, and the player\u2019s avatar. Each sprite has specific interactions and properties.\n   - **Avatar (Player Character)**: Can move around and interacts with boxes and walls.\n   - **Boxes**: Can be pushed by the avatar and act as movable obstacles.\n   - **Holes**: Can cause the avatar or boxes to \"die\" or be removed from the game.\n   - **Exit**: Represents the goal of the level and can be reached for scoring.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - **Moving Back**: The avatar cannot pass through walls and will bounce back.\n   - **Bounce Forward**: If the avatar collides with a box, it pushes the box forward.\n   - **Undoing Moves**: Colliding a box with a wall or the exit resets the state of the game for that box.\n   - **Collisions with Holes**: Contact with a hole will lead to points being deducted or the player losing.\n\n### Objective:\nThe player\u2019s primary objective is to reach the exit (cheese) while navigating the level and interacting with boxes and walls. Successfully reaching the exit will increase the player's score by 1 and concludes the level.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the exit (`exit avatar`), resulting in the score increasing by 1.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - If the avatar is removed (limit of avatars reaches 0).\n  - If the timeout of 1000 ticks is reached without reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Path Planning**: Before moving, analyze the path to the exit and consider obstacles. Use the walls and boxes to create a safe route.\n  \n2. **Box Management**: Use the boxes effectively to manipulate the layout. Position boxes in such a way that they block holes or help create a path to the exit.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Steer clear of holes as they will negatively impact your score and can lead to losing your avatar.\n\n4. **Timing and Resource Management**: Be aware of the time limit. Make deliberate moves to avoid time waste and ensure you have enough time to reach the exit.\n\n5. **Replay and Learn**: If you run into a loss condition, observe what went wrong and adjust your strategy in subsequent attempts for efficiency.\n\nBy combining these strategies with careful navigation and problem-solving skills, players can progress through levels effectively while managing the game\u2019s mechanics and interactions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> a\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

Moving **Right to (6, 7)** is clear but leads towards a box (which may be useful later).\n\nGiven that there are ample open spaces and considering the next expected moves towards the exit, **moving up (5, 6)** provides pathways for further strategy without risking getting into a hole.\n\nThus, the chosen action is:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of moving towards the exit while avoiding hazards and maintaining flexibility for future moves.",
