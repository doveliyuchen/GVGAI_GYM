    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules provided, here's an analysis of the game, including its genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and suggested overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **2D platformer/puzzle** game. It involves navigating through a layout filled with obstacles (walls) and interacting with various sprites (camels, avatars, etc.) to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - The game consists of various sprites including a player-controlled avatar, camels that act as NPCs, and obstacles (walls).\n   - There are also goal indicators (a green door) and different camel types that exhibit varying speeds and behaviors.\n\n2. **Movement**:\n   - The avatar can move around the level, interacting with walls and navigating toward the goal.\n   - Camels behave as both obstacles and moving characters that can affect the player's score depending on their interactions.\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar transforms into a winning sprite when it reaches the goal, resulting in a positive score change.\n   - If a camel reaches the goal, it transforms into a losing NPC sprite and causes a negative score change for the player.\n\n4. **Walls**: \n   - The avatar and camels are not able to pass through walls and will step back when they collide with them.\n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is for the player (avatar) to reach the goal (green door) before any camels do. \n- The player must avoid letting any camels reach this goal, as that would cause the player to lose points and potentially end the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if their avatar is the first to reach the goal (green door), transforming into a \"winnerPlayer\" sprite.\n- The player loses if any camel reaches the goal first, transforming into a \"winnerNPC\" sprite.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement Strategy**: \n   - Navigate carefully while being aware of the camels\u2019 movements. Since they have different speeds, observe their patterns to avoid collisions.\n\n2. **Timing**: \n   - Time your movements so that you reach the goal just ahead of any camels. This may involve strategic positioning and waiting for the right moment to dash toward the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles**: \n   - Make use of the level layout to avoid walls but simultaneously plan routes that are quicker to the goal. Ensure that you do not corner yourself where camels can block your path or reach the goal first.\n\n4. **Predict Enemy Moves**: \n   - Since camels have defined speeds, predict their approach to the goal and plan your movements to be one step ahead.\n\n5. **Use the Level Layout**: \n   - The layout has narrow paths and obstacles. Take advantage of this by leading camels into walls, causing them to step back, giving you more time to reach the goal.\n\n6. **Adaptability**: \n   - Stay adaptable because the random movement of the camels can change the dynamic quickly. Always have a contingency plan in case the camels approach the goal faster than anticipated.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics and developing a solid strategy, players can improve their chances of winning in this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "### Current State Analysis\nBased on the most recent state provided, here are key details:\n\n- Player avatar (`a`) is at row 4, column 44.\n- The goal (`#`) is located at row 1, column 46.\n- There are multiple camels (`@`) nearby, particularly two at row 2, columns 29 and 30, and others at row 3, columns 29 and 30.\n\n### Movement Strategy Review\n1. **Position**: The avatar is currently positioned just to the left of column 45 where there is a wall blocking further left movement. \n2. **Goal Proximity**: The goal is two rows above and two columns to the right. The optimal route needs to navigate carefully through the walls.\n\n3. **Threat Assessment**: The camels in rows 2 and 3 can move toward the goal as they are only a few columns away. The urgency for the player to reach the goal before the camels increases.\n\n### Potential Actions\nSince the avatar\u2019s last action was moving down, it can be varied for this turn. The following movements can be assessed:\n\n- **ACTION_UP (Action 4)**: This would take the avatar from row 4 to row 3, keeping it safe from immediate contact with oncoming camels but does not help with reaching the goal.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (Action 3)**: Moving down would take the avatar to row 5, column 44, and while it continues the downward movement, it does not progress toward the goal.\n- **ACTION_LEFT (Action 1)**: Moving left is not an option as it would hit a wall.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (Action 2)**: This seems to be the most favorable option as it progresses toward the goal while potentially evading immediate threats.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven that the camels are closely positioned to the goal, to keep moving towards the goal, I choose:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right strategically progresses toward the goal while allowing the avatar to navigate the level layout more effectively. The expectation is that this action aligns with advancing toward the goal and avoids the camels reaching it first.",
