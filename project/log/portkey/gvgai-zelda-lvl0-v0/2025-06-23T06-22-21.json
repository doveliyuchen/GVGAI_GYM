You control an avatar navigating a level that looks a bit like a labyrinth or dungeon. Here\u2019s a breakdown of its elements:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a maze/puzzle-action game where you move an avatar over a grid of tiles.\n\u2003\u2013 The level is built using sprites like floor, wall, and goal. Walls and floors form the environment, while interactive items (key, door, sword) and roaming enemies (monsters with varying speeds) add challenge.\n\u2003\u2013 The avatar can \u201cshoot\u201d a sword (a flickering oriented weapon) and normally interacts with various sprites.\n\u2003\u2013 There are distinct states for your character: \u201cnokey\u201d (without a key) and \u201cwithkey\u201d (after picking up the key). Picking up the key transforms your character, enabling further progress.\n\n\u2022 Objectives and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The main objective is to obtain the key first (by running into it while in the nokey state, causing a transformation to the withkey state) and then use that state to interact with the goal (a door). Only when you have the key will colliding with the goal trigger a win (the goal gets \u201ckilled\u201d or removed, which is the win condition).\n\u2003\u2013 There are enemies roaming the level (fast, normal, slow monsters) that can be dispatched either by your sword or \u2013 less ideally \u2013 by direct collision (which carries a score penalty).\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is eliminated.\n\n\u2022 Additional Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 The sword is a limited, flickering projectile that you can use to kill enemies and gain bonus points.\n\u2003\u2013 Enemies, when interacting with the sword, are removed with a positive score gain; however, colliding with them as the avatar without caution takes a penalty.\n\u2003\u2013 The interaction rules (for example, not being able to enter the door with a nokey, or being forced to back away from walls and enemies in some cases) enforce puzzle-like decision making on how you navigate the maze.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Navigate through the maze to reach the key first. Since you start without the key, avoid trying to use the door\u2014the game won\u2019t let you pass with your character\u2019s \u201cnokey\u201d state.\n\u2003\u2013 Use careful movement and the avatar\u2019s sword ability to clear or avoid roaming monsters. It\u2019s typically better to dispatch them with the sword than collide directly, as that collision can cost you points.\n\u2003\u2013 Once you have the key (your avatar transforms to \u201cwithkey\u201d), head to the goal (door). Use the correct collision interaction (with the door) to \u201ckill\u201d it, which triggers the win condition.\n\u2003\u2013 Balance your movement, timing of sword use, and path planning to avoid or overcome enemy movements while completing the key\u2010and\u2010door objective.\n\nIn simple terms, plan a path through a maze, collect the key to unlock the door, and use your sword to ward off enemies that might get in your way. Effective navigation and careful combat are essential to win the game without losing your avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwithkey -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
