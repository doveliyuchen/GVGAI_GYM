The presence of goal and key mechanics suggests it may also belong to the \"adventure\" category.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Player Characters**: The game features various sprites, including a player avatar that can shoot (using a sword), monsters, keys, and goals.\n- **Collectibles and Goal Interaction**: The player must collect keys to open a specific door (goal). The keys are associated with gaining extra abilities or advantages (e.g., transforming from \"nokey\" state to \"withkey\" state).\n- **Enemy Interactions**: Players can kill enemies to gain points or potentially lose points when the enemy attacks the player avatar.\n- **Movement and Obstacles**: Walls are immovable, and players must interact with certain elements (like movable walls) to navigate through the levels.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe player's primary objective is to:\n1. Collect keys (to transition from the \"nokey\" avatar to the \"withkey\" avatar).\n2. Use the keys to access the goal (the green door) to complete the level.\n3. Score points by defeating enemies.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the player fully collects the key and interacts with the goal, indicated by the sprite counter for the goal reaching a target state (win=True).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the player avatar is eliminated (sprite counter for avatar reaches defined loss state, win=False).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Focus on Key Collection**: Prioritize locating keys within the map to enable interactions with the goal. Understanding the layout could lead to finding keys more efficiently.\n2. **Manage Enemy Encounters**: Engage enemies tactically; they can provide positive score changes upon defeat, but player health should be managed to avoid losing points. Consider avoiding enemies when low on health, retreating if necessary.\n3. **Use of Movable Walls**: Leverage interactions with movable walls to create paths or block enemies. This adds complexity to navigation and can provide strategic advantages.\n4. **Plan Movement Carefully**: Observe enemy movement patterns and plan accordingly to avoid unnecessary damage. Take advantage of cooldown timings to strike or evade effectively.\n5. **Explore the Map**: Pay attention to every section of the level to gather all keys before attempting to reach the goal. Since the game seems to allow exploration, understanding the full environment can unlock easier paths.\n\nArmed with this analysis, players can navigate the game's challenges strategically to ensure successful completion of levels while maximizing their score through effective combat and exploration.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsword wall -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The goal is located at (5,10) and there is a key at (3,10) which we need to collect in order to reach the goal and transition to the \"withkey\" state.\n\nGiven the layout of the map, the strategy is to move towards the key first. Currently, the avatar can move:\n\n- **Left (to (3,3))** - a wall (`w`), so it's blocked.\n- **Right (to (3,5))** - an empty space (`.`), possible move.\n- **Up (to (2,4))** - also an empty space (`.`), possible move.\n- **Down (to (4,4))** - another wall (`w`), so it's blocked.\n\nSince our goal is to collect the key, moving right to (3,5) is the best action as it puts us one step closer to the key at (3,10). After that, we will assess our next move based on the updated position.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action should move the avatar to the right, and I expect to be in a better position to reach the key on the next turn.",
