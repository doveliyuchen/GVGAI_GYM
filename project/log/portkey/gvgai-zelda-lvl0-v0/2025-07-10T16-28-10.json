    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThis game can be classified as a **Puzzle-Platformer with Action Elements.** Players navigate through a grid-based environment, solving puzzles to unlock goals while engaging in combat with enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n1. **Sprites and Movement:**\n   - Players control an avatar that can shoot with a sword.\n   - The level is filled with various standing objects (walls) and interactable sprites (keys, goals, enemies).\n   - Movable walls can be interacted with to create pathways or block paths.\n  \n2. **Key Mechanics:**\n   - The avatar can collect keys to open doors (goals) that lead to winning the level.\n   - Enemies can be defeated using the sword, with specific rewards for defeating them.\n   - The avatar's state changes based on whether it has a key (from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n\n3. **Enemies and Combat:**\n   - There are different types of monsters with varying cooldowns and characteristics, requiring different strategies for combat.\n   - The player loses points and potentially loses if their avatar is defeated by enemies.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal (green door) after acquiring a key. The player must navigate the level, defeat enemies, and manage their interactions with keys and walls to progress toward the objective.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal sprite with the key, which adds to the player's score (scoreChange=1).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is defeated by an enemy (scoreChange=-1).\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n\n1. **Explore and Plan:**\n   - Thoroughly explore the level layout to identify the positions of keys and enemies before making any moves.\n   - Use walls and the environment to block enemy paths if necessary.\n\n2. **Combat Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize defeating enemies when it is safe to do so; if overwhelmed, retreat and wait for cooldowns to reset.\n   - Manage your distance from enemies while using the sword to maintain health and avoid immediate danger.\n\n3. **Key Collection:**\n   - Focus on collecting keys as soon as they appear; turning into the \"withkey\" sprite allows you to unlock the door and win the level.\n   - Ensure that you have a clear path to the goal before engaging in combat or collecting items.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks:**\n   - Avoid engaging multiple enemies simultaneously unless you are confident in your abilities.\n   - Backtrack when needed, using less direct routes when encountering tough enemies or locked pathways.\n\n5. **Efficiency:**\n   - Develop a mental map of the level to efficiently navigate between enemies, keys, and the goal.\n   - Aim to minimize the number of moves and actions by planning your routes carefully.\n\nBy balancing exploration, key collection, and combat, you can maximize your effectiveness and successfully reach the goal while minimizing potential losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsword -> '&'\ngoal monsterNormal -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> m\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To start, let's analyze the current state of the game environment:\n\n1. The avatar is represented as 'a', but its position is not explicitly provided in the current map description. \n2. The goal ('g') is located at (5, 10) on the map.\n3. There is a key ('#') located at (3, 10).\n4. There are various enemies ('$', in this case) located throughout the map, and walls ('w') block certain paths. \n5. There are additional obstacles and strategic points, such as movable walls or interactable sprites, primarily around rows 5 to 8.\n\nGiven that we need to reach the goal at (5, 10) and that there is a key at (3, 10), we should consider the most efficient route while taking any enemies and walls into account.\n\n## Recommended Action:\nFirst, if we are at or near the key at position (3, 10), we should prioritize collecting it since it is essential for winning the level. Then, without the avatar's specific position, we can assume we are close to an action point.\n\n### Taking the Action:\nIf our avatar is indeed positioned to the left of the key at (3, 10), we can move right to collect it.\n\n**Action:**\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThis action is aimed at collecting the key, positioning us to unlock the door later on. Upon collecting the key, we should be in a stronger position to navigate towards the goal, aligning with the strategy of securing keys promptly.",
