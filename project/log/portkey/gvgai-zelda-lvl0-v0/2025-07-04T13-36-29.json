    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nHere\u2019s an overview of what\u2019s going on in the game:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Feel:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s essentially an action\u2013adventure puzzle game with arcade elements. You\u2019re navigating a maze-like level, avoiding or fighting enemies, collecting items, and reaching an objective.\n\u2003\u2013 The game mixes puzzle-solving (figuring out the safe path and item collection) with real\u2011time action (dodging or shooting enemies).\n\n\u2022 Key Mechanics:\n\u20031. Movement and Shooting:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 You control an avatar that can shoot using a sword attack. The avatar has a defined \u201cshoot\u201d behavior (frameRate=8) so timing and aiming are part of the gameplay.\n\u20032. Items and Transformations:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 You must collect a key (represented by the \u201ckey\u201d sprite). The key is essential for unlocking the door\u2014the \u201cgoal\u201d\u2014that leads to victory.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 When an unkeyed character (shown as \u201cnokey\u201d) touches the key, it transforms into the \u201cwithkey\u201d version. This indicates you\u2019re now carrying the key.\n\u20033. Enemies and Combat:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Various enemies (including \u201cmonsterQuick\u201d, \u201cmonsterNormal\u201d, \u201cmonsterSlow\u201d, and generic \u201cenemy\u201d) patrol the level.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Your sword can be used to defeat enemies (interaction: enemy + sword kills the enemy and scores points). However, you must avoid direct contact with enemies as colliding with them causes a penalty or even kills the avatar.\n\u20034. Goal Interaction:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The door (\u201cgoal\u201d) only reacts correctly when you approach it as the \u201cwithkey\u201d version; otherwise, if you\u2019re in the \u201cnokey\u201d state, the door pushes you back.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Reaching the goal as \u201cwithkey\u201d effectively wins the level.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: Navigate the level, overcome obstacles, collect the key to transform your avatar into its \u201cwithkey\u201d state, and then reach the goal door to complete the level.\n\u2003\u2013 Win Condition: The game ends successfully when you interact with the goal (door) while in the correct state (with the key).\n\u2003\u2013 Loss Condition: The game is lost if your avatar is killed (for example, by coming into contact with enemies without using your sword attack properly).\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Early in the level, focus on staying safe by dodging enemies and planning your route through the maze of walls and obstacles.\n\u20032. Prioritize collecting the key safely. Since transforming to \u201cwithkey\u201d is essential for opening the goal door, find a secure path to the key while minimizing risky encounters.\n\u20033. Use your sword attack to eliminate any enemies that get too close. The ability to \u201cshoot\u201d with your sword means you can keep dangerous foes at bay.\n\u20034. Once you have the key (and your avatar is now \u201cwithkey\u201d), plot a course towards the goal door. Since the door only works when you\u2019re carrying the key, avoiding unnecessary fighting or distractions is wise at this point.\n\u20035. Throughout, observe the enemy patterns (the different monsters have varying speeds and cooldowns) and adjust your moves accordingly; patience and cautious advancement are key.\n\nIn simple terms, you need to navigate a labyrinth: pick up the key, fend off or avoid monsters using your sword, and then make your way to the door to finish the level. Managing risk and timing your actions (both shooting and moving) are crucial for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwithkey -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> &\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
