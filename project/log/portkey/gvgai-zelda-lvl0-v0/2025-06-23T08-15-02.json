    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:**  Looks like a top-down puzzle/adventure game, possibly with rogue-like elements due to the use of random elements and the potential for character death.\n\n**Objective:**  The main goal is to reach the `goal` (door) with the `withkey` (avatar with a key) sprite, opening the door and winning the game.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** You control an `avatar` (player character).\n*   **Shooting:** The avatar can shoot swords (`sword` sprite).\n*   **Enemies:** There are various enemy types (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`) that move randomly.\n*   **Keys:** You need to collect a key (`key`) to open the goal (`goal`).\n*   **Combat:** You can defeat enemies by shooting them with swords.\n*   **Immovable Objects:** `wall` and `floor` sprites are immovable.\n*   `movable` sprites can be pushed around, and they step back if they run into a wall.\n\n**Win Condition:**  Eliminate all `goal` sprites on the map.\n\n**Loss Condition:**  Eliminate all `avatar` sprites on the map.\n\n**Key Sprites and Their Function:**\n\n*   `floor`: Decorative background.\n*   `goal`: The exit door, requires a key to open.\n*   `key`:  Pick this up to become `withkey`.\n*   `sword`:  Projectile fired by the avatar to kill enemies.\n*   `movable`: Pushable blocks that can be used for puzzles.\n*   `avatar`: The player character (starts without a key).\n*   `nokey`:  The avatar sprite when *without* the key.\n*   `withkey`: The avatar sprite when *with* the key. Can open the goal.\n*   `enemy`:  A generic enemy type.\n*   `monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`: Specific enemy types with varying movement speeds.\n*   `wall`: Obstacles that block movement.\n\n**Interactions Explained:**\n\n*   `movable wall`: Movable sprites cannot move into walls.\n*   `nokey goal`: Avatar without the key cannot enter the goal.\n*   `goal withkey`: Avatar with the key can enter the goal and wins the level\n*   `enemy sword`: Shooting an enemy kills it and increases score by 2.\n*   `enemy enemy`: Enemies cannot occupy the same space.\n*   `avatar enemy`: The player dies when colliding with an enemy, score decreases by 1.\n*   `nokey key`: The player picks up the key and becomes `withkey`, score increases by 1, and the key disappears.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:**  Prioritize finding and collecting the `key`.\n2.  **Enemy Avoidance/Combat:**  Be cautious around enemies. Use the `sword` to kill them, but be mindful of the limited ammo or cooldown.\n3.  **Puzzle Solving (if applicable):** Use `movable` blocks to create pathways, block enemies, or access the `key` or `goal`.\n4.  **Pathfinding:**  Plan your route carefully, taking into account enemy movement patterns and the positions of walls and `movable` blocks.\n5.  **Risk Management:** Avoid enemy contact to prevent losing the game.\n\nIn essence, the player needs to navigate the level, get the key, avoid or kill enemies, and then reach the exit. It's a mix of puzzle-solving, strategic combat, and careful movement.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nkey monsterNormal -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
