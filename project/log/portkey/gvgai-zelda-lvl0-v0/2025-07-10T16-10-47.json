In the game, the avatar is represented by a \u201cnokey\u201d version until it picks up the key, at which point it transforms into \u201cwithkey.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 The key is needed to interact with the goal (door). Only when your avatar has the key can it open (or \u201ckill\u201d in the game\u2019s term) the goal to win.\n\u2003\u2013 Enemies include various monsters that move randomly at different speeds (fast, normal, slow). Their symbols are \u201c2\u201d in the map, and they behave as hostile entities.\n\u2003\u2013 You can use a \u201csword\u201d projectile (fired by your avatar) to kill enemy sprites. The sword has a limited life span (limit 5) and can face in different directions (\u201cOrientedFlicker\u201d), meaning you need to aim it properly.\n\u2003\u2013 Walls and other immovable objects create barriers that force you to take detours or backtrack when bumped into.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2013 The main objective is to pick up the key and then reach the goal (a green door) to finish the level.\n\u2003\u2013 Win Condition: The game ends in a win when the goal (door) sprite is removed (opened) after being touched by an avatar that is in the \u201cwithkey\u201d state.\n\u2003\u2013 Loss Condition: If your avatar is killed (for example, by coming in contact with an enemy in the wrong way), the game ends in a loss. (There\u2019s even a score penalty when the avatar collides with an enemy.)\n\n\u2022 Strategy Tips\n\u20031. Explore Carefully: Navigate the maze steadily. Know that walls force you to backtrack, so plan your route from your starting point toward both the key and then the door.\n\u20032. Secure the Key First: Don\u2019t rush to the door\u2014first locate the key. Without it, you cannot access the goal and might have to avoid certain obstacles.\n\u20033. Watch for Enemies: Since enemies wander randomly and come at different speeds, keep an eye on their patterns. Avoid direct collisions that not only hurt your score but might risk losing your avatar.\n\u20034. Use the Sword Wisely: When an enemy is too close, shoot your sword projectile. It can help clear a path through enemy territory and potentially even boost your score by eliminating foes.\n\u20035. Manage Your Movement: Since some interactions make sprites \u201cstepBack\u201d on collision, use these mechanics to your advantage in tight corridors. This means smooth positioning and tactical retreats might be necessary.\n\u20036. Balance Offense and Objective: While eliminating enemies can help with scoring, remember that your goal is to get the key and reach the door. Sometimes avoiding combat is smarter than engaging.\n\nIn summary, plan your route through the maze, grab the key, carefully deal with or avoid roaming monsters using precise movement and strategic sword attacks, and finally head to the door to win. This blend of puzzle solving, cautious exploration, and occasional combat is at the heart of the game\u2019s appeal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nwithkey -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> &\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
