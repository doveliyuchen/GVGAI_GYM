    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the rules you've provided:\n\n**Game Genre:**\n\n*   **Puzzle/Action Adventure:** The layout, key/door mechanic, enemies, and limited sword uses suggest a combination of puzzle-solving and action.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player (avatar) likely moves on a grid-based system.\n*   **Shooting/Attacking:** The avatar \"shoots\" swords using `ShootAvatar` which are of type 'sword'. Swords are limited use.\n*   **Key/Door:** A classic key and door mechanic. Player needs a key ('nokey' -> 'withkey') to open the goal ('goal').\n*   **Enemies:** Enemies patrol randomly ('RandomNPC'). Different enemy types vary in speed/difficulty ('monsterQuick', 'monsterNormal', 'monsterSlow').\n*   **Health/Damage:** The player seems to have a health pool represented by avatar sprites. Colliding with enemies decreases the player's score.\n*   **Immovable objects:** Some objects such as walls are `Immovable` and cannot be passed.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Reach the goal (door) with the key.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All goal sprites are removed (SpriteCounter stype=goal win=True). This likely happens when the player opens the door.\n*   **Lose:** All avatar sprites are removed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False). Likely the player is killed by enemies.\n\n**Sprites and their properties:**\n\n*   **floor:** Background tile.\n*   **goal:** The door to be opened.\n*   **key:** Collect to open the door.\n*   **sword:** Projectile shot by avatar. Limited ammo.\n*   **movable:** Can be pushed, potentially to solve puzzles.\n*   **avatar:** The player character.\n*   **nokey:** The player character without a key.\n*   **withkey:** The player character with a key.\n*   **enemy:** Base class for all enemy types.\n*   **monsterQuick:** Fast enemy.\n*   **monsterNormal:** Normal speed enemy.\n*   **monsterSlow:** Slow enemy.\n*   **wall:** Obstacle.\n\n**Interactions:**\n\n*   **Movable Wall:** Can be pushed back by avatar.\n*   **Avatar & Enemy:** avatar dies and score decreases.\n*   **Enemy & Sword:** enemy dies and score increases.\n*   **Key & Avatar:** Avatar transforms into a new state that has a key.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Acquisition:** The first priority is always finding and picking up the key.\n2.  **Enemy Avoidance/Combat:** The player must kill or avoid the enemies to reach the goal. Killing enemies is essential for score.\n3.  **Conserve Swords:** Swords are limited use. Don't waste them.\n4.  **Solve Puzzles:** Use movable blocks and other mechanics to navigate the level to get the key.\n5.  **Plan Your Path:** The level layout is important. Consider possible monster patrol routes.\n6.  **Optimize for Score:** Kill enemies as you go, while ensuring you don't die.\n\nIn essence, this appears to be a puzzle-action game where the player must collect a key, avoid or defeat enemies, and use the key to open the door to win, all while managing limited resources (swords) and avoiding death.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\ngoal monsterNormal -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
