This is characterized by navigating levels filled with obstacles and challenges requiring the player to solve puzzles, manipulate items, and avoid dangers.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game features several types of sprites, including static elements like floors, walls, and holes, as well as dynamic entities such as the moving avatar (the player) and chaser enemies (piranhas).\n- **Interactions:** The player avatar can interact with various sprites:\n  - Collecting coins and boxes increases the score.\n  - Piranhas chase the avatar and can kill the player.\n  - The box can be moved and has specific behaviors, such as bouncing the player back and killing the player if placed in a hole.\n  - Switching mechanisms can alter the state of the environment (e.g., generating walls).\n- **Movement:** While the walls and holes are immovable, the player has the ability to jump, move, and interact with specific tiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to collect enough boxes to fulfill the win condition (limit = 0 for sprite type 'box') while avoiding deaths caused by piranhas. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when all boxes are collected, which includes navigating through the level successfully without being killed.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar (player) is killed. This can happen if they encounter the piranha or fall into a hole.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Explore the Environment:** Take time to navigate the level to find the locations of boxes, coins, switch tiles, and piranhas. Understanding the layout will help you plan your approach.\n\n2. **Avoid Piranhas:** Since they chase the avatar, avoid areas where piranhas are present and plan routes that use walls and other obstacles to block their line of sight.\n\n3. **Utilize Switches:** These can spawn additional walls which may provide useful barriers between you and the chaser. Activate them strategically to control enemy movements.\n\n4. **Box Management:** Remember that boxes can be dangerous if placed incorrectly (inside holes can lead to a loss), so think through your movements carefully before pushing or collecting them.\n\n5. **Coin Collection:** Collecting coins will increase your score but prioritize the boxes as they are necessary for winning the game.\n\n6. **Movement and Jumping:** Utilize the avatar\u2019s movement abilities effectively. Jump over gaps and be mindful of where you land to avoid pitfalls and maintain a safe distance from chasing enemies.\n\n7. **Plan Ahead:** Always anticipate the next few moves, especially when dealing with moving enemies. This foresight can help you avoid bad situations and successfully navigate through challenging areas.\n\nExecuting this strategy with patience and observation will significantly enhance your chances of successfully completing the levels in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\ncoin floor piranha -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> w\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=13 -> w\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> e\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> e\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> #\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> #\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> a\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=13 -> w\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> 0\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w\nrow=13, col=0 -> w\nrow=13, col=1 -> w\nrow=13, col=2 -> w\nrow=13, col=3 -> w\nrow=13, col=4 -> w\nrow=13, col=5 -> w\nrow=13, col=6 -> w\nrow=13, col=7 -> w\nrow=13, col=8 -> w\nrow=13, col=9 -> w\nrow=13, col=10 -> w\nrow=13, col=11 -> w\nrow=13, col=12 -> w\nrow=13, col=13 -> w\nrow=13, col=14 -> w",
