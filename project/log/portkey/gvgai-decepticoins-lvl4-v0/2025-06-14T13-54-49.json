Players navigate through a level filled with obstacles and must use specific mechanics to solve puzzles and progress to the next level.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes, and floor), passive objects (boxes), and movable entities (the avatar and a piranha enemy).\n- **Interactions**: Different interactions occur based on how the avatar (the player's character) interacts with these sprites:\n  - The avatar can die if it collides with a piranha.\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes and push them into holes for points.\n  - The player can collect coins by colliding with them, which adds to the score.\n  - Interacting with switches can generate walls as obstacles and also destroy them.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main goal is to clear the level by manipulating the environment, specifically by ensuring there are no boxes left on the screen (the limit for boxes must go to zero). Collecting coins also contributes to the score, but it seems optional compared to the main objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Players win the game by removing all boxes from the screen.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar (player's character) reaches a count of zero, which suggests that the avatar can be killed, presumably by the piranha or falling into a hole.\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Enemies**: Steer clear of the piranha and plan movements to prevent being killed, as losing the avatar means game over.\n   \n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: While boxes can be tools to reach objectives or manipulate the level layout, players should avoid pushing them into holes unless aiming to score. Instead, prioritize positioning them to interact with switches or walls beneficially.\n\n3. **Collect Coins**: Although collecting coins is secondary, gathering them whenever possible increases your score. A higher score may provide benefits or options in future levels.\n\n4. **Exploit Switches**: Interaction with switches is critical. Players should take advantage of these to manipulate walls and progress through the level. Use them to create paths or remove obstacles as necessary.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path**: Analyze the level layout before moving. Look for safe routes that allow for effective box maneuvers and coin collection without encountering the piranha.\n\n6. **Careful Movement**: Given the game\u2019s ability to step back or undo actions (when boxes interact with walls), make sure to keep track of movements to avoid unnecessary setbacks while positioning yourself strategically in the environment.\n\nBy following these strategies and assessing the level layout effectively, players can progress through levels, clear boxes efficiently, and avoid losing their avatar to enemies or fall hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> e\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> w\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=13 -> w\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> e\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> e\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> a\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=13 -> w\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> 0\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w\nrow=13, col=0 -> w\nrow=13, col=1 -> w\nrow=13, col=2 -> w\nrow=13, col=3 -> w\nrow=13, col=4 -> w\nrow=13, col=5 -> w\nrow=13, col=6 -> w\nrow=13, col=7 -> w\nrow=13, col=8 -> w\nrow=13, col=9 -> w\nrow=13, col=10 -> w\nrow=13, col=11 -> w\nrow=13, col=12 -> w\nrow=13, col=13 -> w\nrow=13, col=14 -> w",

Around the avatar\u2019s current position, the following can be observed:\n\n- (8, 5) is an empty space (.) and (8, 7) is also empty (.).\n- (8, 4) and (8, 3) both contain enemies (e).\n- Furthermore, the higher rows (like row 4 and row 5) contain boxes (@) and coins (#), which are essential for interaction.\n\nSince the main goal is to remove all boxes from the screen and avoid the enemies, I need to move in a way that keeps me safe from the piranhas while also planning to tackle the nearest boxes possibly.\n\nThe direction I can take from (8, 6) involves:\n1. Moving left to (8, 5) which is clear.\n2. Moving right to (8, 7) which is also clear.\n\nBoth these moves are safe as they keep me away from the enemies and provide an option to access the boxes later.\n\nGiven that there are no immediate boxes to interact with and to avoid the threat from piranhas, I'll choose to move left to explore and avoid enemy encounters first.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left seems to be the safest action, allowing me to explore a pathway free from immediate threats. I expect this action to help me assess the next potential box interactions without getting into danger.",
