    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**  \nThis game appears to be a puzzle platformer, where players navigate an environment to solve challenges, collect items, and possibly avoid or defeat enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game utilizes different types of sprites which include:\n  - **Immovable Sprites:** These include the floor, walls, holes, and coins. They are static elements in the environment.\n  - **Passive Sprites:** The box is a passive element that can interact with the player (avatar) and the environment.\n  - **Chaser Sprite:** The piranha acts as a moving threat to the player, creating an element of danger.\n  - **Moving Avatar:** The player controls the avatar, which can move around the environment.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can interact with various items, such as collecting coins or triggering switches.\n  - The avatar bounces off boxes, which can be used strategically to navigate the level.\n  - When boxes fall into holes, they result in a loss (death) for the avatar.\n  - The switches can either spawn walls or be destroyed, providing players with choices in their strategy.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal is for the player (avatar) to collect a certain number of items (boxes) while navigating through the level, avoiding being killed by the piranha, and managing the obstacles presented by walls and holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by collecting all the boxes (indicated as the SpriteCounter for the box reaching zero).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Understand the Environment:** Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level to navigate effectively. Observe the arrangement of walls, holes, and where coins and boxes are located.\n\n2. **Resource Management:** Prioritize collecting boxes and coins, as they contribute to your score and are essential to winning. Avoid losing the avatar, as that leads to an immediate game over.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Utilize the passive boxes for bouncing and to solve puzzles. Strategically place them near holes to create pathways or to avoid the piranha's attacks.\n\n4. **Avoiding the Piranha:** Stay aware of the piranha\u2019s cooldown period after it performs an action. Use this to your advantage to dodge it effectively. Position yourself well so that you can move to safety after it attacks.\n\n5. **Engage with Switches:** Use switches strategically to manipulate walls for better pathing options while collecting items.\n\n6. **Plan Each Move:** Identify a clear path before proceeding to ensure that you are not blocked or put at risk of falling into a hole or being caught by the piranha.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through the challenges presented by the level, work towards collecting all the boxes, and ultimately achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\ncoin floor piranha -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> w\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=13 -> w\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> e\nrow=8, col=5 -> e\nrow=8, col=6 -> a\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=13 -> w\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> 0\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w\nrow=13, col=0 -> w\nrow=13, col=1 -> w\nrow=13, col=2 -> w\nrow=13, col=3 -> w\nrow=13, col=4 -> w\nrow=13, col=5 -> w\nrow=13, col=6 -> w\nrow=13, col=7 -> w\nrow=13, col=8 -> w\nrow=13, col=9 -> w\nrow=13, col=10 -> w\nrow=13, col=11 -> w\nrow=13, col=12 -> w\nrow=13, col=13 -> w\nrow=13, col=14 -> w",
