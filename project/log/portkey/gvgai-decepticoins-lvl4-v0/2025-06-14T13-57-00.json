Players must navigate an avatar to collect items, avoid obstacles, and interact with various environmental elements to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**:\n   - **Avatar**: This is the player-controlled character that moves throughout the level.\n   - **Boxes**: These can be interacted with to bounce the avatar forward or may be hazardous when placed over holes (causing a loss of the avatar).\n   - **Walls**: Serve as barriers that the avatar cannot pass, with some walls capable of moving back if the avatar interacts with them.\n   - **Coins**: Collectible items that increase the player's score.\n   - **Switches**: Trigger specific events in the game, such as spawning walls or potentially eliminating themselves.\n   - **Piranha (Chaser)**: An enemy that will seek and attack the avatar, leading to game loss upon contact.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can collect coins, interact with boxes to bounce off of them, and trigger switch effects.\n   - Purposeful deaths can occur if the avatar collides with a piranha, falls into a hole with a box, or if the avatar's count reaches zero.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect a certain number of boxes (implied by the termination condition of SpriteCounter). To win, the player must ensure that the count of boxes is at zero before running out of lives. Additionally, collecting coins appears to provide score incentives.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the sprite count for the boxes reaches zero (indicating all boxes have been either solved or removed).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the player loses all avatars (the avatar sprite count reaches zero). \n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Piranhas**: Use the environment (walls and boxes) to create distance from moving piranhas. The player should continuously be aware of their surroundings.\n  \n2. **Manage Boxes**: Box manipulation forms a core mechanic. Players should try to bounce off boxes strategically to move around the level and possibly eliminate or move boxes into holes to decrease their count.\n\n3. **Collect Coins**: Gather coins along the way for scoring purposes. Whenever there is a choice between multiple atrategies, prioritize paths that lead to coin collections.\n\n4. **Utilize Switches**: Make use of switches to spawn walls that can obstruct the piranhas or create new pathways for yourself. This will also help manage the overall level layout.\n\n5. **Plan Movement**: Carefully plan each move, maintaining an awareness of the piranha\u2019s cooldown. Use boxes to bounce forward, but be cautious not to place boxes over holes where they can result in an instant loss.\n\n6. **Level Layout Navigation**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout to plan paths effectively. Knowing where coins and boxes are located can help in devising efficient routes to achieve your objectives.\n\nBy combining strategic movement, efficient box management, and active coin collecting, players can maximize their chances of success while minimizing the risk of encountering hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\ncoin floor piranha -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> w\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=13 -> w\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> e\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> e\nrow=8, col=7 -> e\nrow=8, col=8 -> a\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=13 -> w\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> 0\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w\nrow=13, col=0 -> w\nrow=13, col=1 -> w\nrow=13, col=2 -> w\nrow=13, col=3 -> w\nrow=13, col=4 -> w\nrow=13, col=5 -> w\nrow=13, col=6 -> w\nrow=13, col=7 -> w\nrow=13, col=8 -> w\nrow=13, col=9 -> w\nrow=13, col=10 -> w\nrow=13, col=11 -> w\nrow=13, col=12 -> w\nrow=13, col=13 -> w\nrow=13, col=14 -> w",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game:\n\n- The avatar ('a') is located at (row 8, col 8).\n- Surrounding the avatar are obstacles such as walls ('w') and piranhas ('e'). There are also collectible coins ('#' and '$'), and empty spaces ('.') that the avatar can utilize.\n\nGiven the proximity of two piranhas to the avatar on row 8 (one in col 6 and another in col 7), moving in any direction other than left (col 7 to col 6) and right (col 8 to col 9) directly risks immediate loss. Additionally, moving downwards into an empty space would also keep the avatar safe.\n\nTo ensure movement, I will first check for the possibility of bouncing off boxes nearby or moving away from the piranhas. In this case, there is no box to manipulate at (row 8, col 9), and I must ensure to keep a safe distance from the piranhas.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the action to move **up** to (row 7, col 8), as that will avoid the immediate threats of the piranhas while navigating towards a safer position. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action helps me escape danger from the chasing piranhas while keeping options open for future movements.",
