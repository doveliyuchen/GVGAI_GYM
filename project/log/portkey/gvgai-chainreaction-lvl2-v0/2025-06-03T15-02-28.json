    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle and strategy game, with elements reminiscent of \"sokoban\" (box-pushing) and obstacle navigation mechanics, combined with a resource management element due to the interaction of boulders and the player's avatar.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game involves multiple immovable and movable sprites, each with a distinct function (e.g., walls, goals, boulders).\n   - The 'avatar' represents the player, who interacts with different objects on the game board.\n   - 'Boxes' and 'boulders' can be manipulated to achieve objectives by pushing or bouncing.\n  \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can transform boulders and boxes through specific interactions, indicating a puzzle-solving mechanic where manipulation of objects is critical.\n   - There are various states and forms of boulders, which can change based on the avatar's actions (normal, master, stopping).\n\n3. **Objectives:**\n   - The main objective is to navigate the avatar to manipulate the boulders to achieve a score while avoiding certain pitfalls (holes and walls).\n   - The 'goal' sprites seem to represent target locations for the avatar to reach.\n  \n4. **Scoring System:**\n   - Interactions can alter the score positively or negatively, depending on the outcome of moving objects to certain locations (e.g., boulders in goals yield points, while the avatar falling into a hole results in a score penalty).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - Successfully navigate the level to have no remaining target boulders.\n  - Score management by moving boulders to the goal can lead to a win.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - Running out of avatars (lives).\n  - Timeout reaching a limit of 1500 units.\n  - Accumulated score penalties resulting in negative scores.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Before moving, analyze potential interaction outcomes to avoid unwanted penalties (like falling into holes or running into walls).\n   - Start with simple interactions and observe how changes (like shifting boulder types) impact your strategy.\n\n2. **Utilize Object Transformations:**\n   - Take advantage of the transformations available with the boulders. For instance, managing them carefully to convert between masterBoulder and normalBoulder states can create advantageous situations.\n  \n3. **Focus on Goals:**\n   - Prioritize moving boulders to the goal location to maximize your score. Ensure you track how many boulders you have left to complete the level.\n\n4. **Avoid Penalties:**\n   - Keep an eye on holes and ensure the avatar does not inadvertently fall in, which costs you heavily in score.\n   - Use the walls strategically to control the movement or redirection of boulders effectively.\n\n5. **Think Ahead:**\n   - Anticipate consequences of moves. If pushing a box or boulder leads to a sequence that could mess up your goals or lead your avatar to a hole, consider alternate paths.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the complex interactions within the game, players can enhance their chances of completing levels successfully and efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> %\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> a\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is positioned at (8, 10). The nearby positions contain the following relevant entities:\n\n- (8, 9): Hole (#) - which is a penalty if I fall into it.\n- (8, 11): Floor goal (@) - a target that I can potentially score by reaching it.\n\n### Next Action Analysis:\nTo make a meaningful move, I should focus on avoiding the hole and aiming toward the goal, which will reward me points. The available directions from my position (hoping to move towards the goal) are:\n\n- UP (7, 10): This is a floor (.) which is safe and does not cause harm.\n- DOWN (9, 10): This is a wall (&), thus I cannot move there.\n- LEFT (8, 9): This is a hole (#) which I want to avoid.\n- RIGHT (8, 11): This is the goal (@) which I want to reach.\n\nSince I cannot go down, cannot go left (to the hole), and can only go up to a safe floor or right into the goal, the best action is to move to the right.\n\n### Execution:\nI will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to move directly to the goal. I expect that this is aligned with the strategy of focusing on goals to maximize my score.",
