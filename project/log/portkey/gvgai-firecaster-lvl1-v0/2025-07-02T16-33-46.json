It can be collected to increase score.\n  - **Avatar:** The player's character, capable of moving, shooting bullets, and interacting with other objects.\n  - **Goal:** Completing the level, needing to interact with it to achieve victory.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - Resources need to be managed since the avatar can only hold a limited amount of mana (3).\n  - The avatar can be damaged by fire or fire-based enemies.\n  - Obstacles and enemies can eliminate the avatar, resulting in game loss.\n  - Collisions with walls force the avatar to step back, indicating that movement through the environment must be carefully planned.\n  \n**Objectives:**\n- The main goal is to reach the **goal sprite** while ensuring the avatar survives by managing health and avoiding damage from enemies (particularly fire).\n- Collect mana to increase score while also using it strategically for offense against boxes and enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition:**\n  - The game is lost if the avatar's health (3 points) reaches 0.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize collecting mana without exposing the avatar to fire, as collecting mana increases your score and allows for ammo replenishment.\n\n2. **Environment Navigation:**\n   - Use walls to your advantage; bouncing off them can help navigate around obstacles or avoid fire.\n   - Plan your movement to avoid getting trapped by fire or the spread of fire from boxes.\n\n3. **Combat Tactics:**\n   - Use bullets effectively; aim to hit boxes to turn them into fire, potentially creating hazards for other threats in the level.\n   - Avoid direct confrontation with fire unless necessary, since it damages the avatar significantly.\n\n4. **Keep Moving and Stay Alert:**\n   - Constantly keep moving while observing the patterns of fire spreads and enemy behaviors to navigate safely.\n   - Always have an exit plan when interacting with dangerous sprites (like fire or bullet interactions).\n\n5. **Reach The Goal:**\n   - Focus on planning the route to the goal sprite while considering the layout, barriers, and available resources.\n\nBy following these strategies and focusing on resource collection and careful navigation, success in completing the level while avoiding death is more achievable.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nmana -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nbullet -> '&'\nfire -> '*'\nfire spark -> 'b'\nfireAsh -> 'f'\nbox spark -> 'g'\nfireAsh spark -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> %\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> @\nrow=1, col=13 -> @\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> @\nrow=1, col=17 -> $\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> @\nrow=2, col=17 -> $\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> @\nrow=4, col=13 -> @\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> @\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> @\nrow=6, col=17 -> $\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> @\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> @\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> a\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> f\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> f\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=16 -> $\nrow=9, col=17 -> $\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
