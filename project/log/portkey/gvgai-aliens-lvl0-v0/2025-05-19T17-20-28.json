Players control an avatar (spaceship) and engage in combat against alien enemies, avoiding and countering their attacks to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game features several types of sprites including:\n  - **Player-controlled Avatar (Spaceship)**: The main character controlled by the player.\n  - **Missiles and Bombs**: Weapons the player can fire against enemies.\n  - **Aliens**: Enemy units that spawn and attack the player.\n  - **Portals**: Points that control the spawning of alien units.\n  - **Base**: The player\u2019s base that must be protected.\n\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar can shoot missiles or \"sam\" bullets at aliens, with different outcomes depending on what it's interacting with (e.g., killing aliens, losing points for being hit by bombs).\n  - Certain interactions yield score changes and affect the game state, such as the player losing points when struck by enemy attacks.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to be to eliminate all alien units before they overwhelm the base. The player must shoot the aliens while avoiding being hit by their bombs and attacks. The player can score points by defeating aliens while protecting the base.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they successfully eliminate all aliens before any reach the base. This might be assessed through a sprite counter that tracks the number of alive alien sprites.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if their avatar is destroyed (indicated by reaching a limit of 0), or if too many aliens manage to reach the base.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Focus on Defense**: Keep a close watch on the base and prioritize shooting down any approaching enemies to prevent them from destroying it.\n2. **Manage Missile Usage**: Conserve missiles by carefully aiming and ensuring you hit as many aliens as possible with fewer shots to maximize efficiency and points.\n3. **Positioning**: Utilize the level layout to your advantage; position your avatar strategically to have the best line of sight for shooting enemies while also keeping potential escape routes in mind.\n4. **Avoid Bombs**: Pay attention to the placement and timing of the enemies\u2019 bomb attacks; avoid getting too close. Moving quickly can help dodge hazards.\n5. **Take Advantage of Score Bonuses**: Target bomb-carrying aliens with sam bullets to score points that might provide strategic advantages later in the game.\n6. **Use Time to Your Advantage**: Take note of spawn cooldowns and plan your attacks to eliminate aliens before they outnumber you.\n\nBy employing these strategies, a player can enhance their chances of surviving against the alien onslaught and ultimately achieve victory in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
