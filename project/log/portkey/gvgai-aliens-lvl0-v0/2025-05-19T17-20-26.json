Players control an avatar (spaceship) and must interact with various sprites, including enemies (aliens and bombs), while trying to protect their base.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game includes various types of sprites:\n  - **Base:** The player must protect their base, which is immovable.\n  - **Avatar:** The player's character, capable of shooting missiles and other projectiles.\n  - **Aliens:** Different types of enemies that spawn from portals, with distinct behaviors (e.g., bomb-throwing and movement).\n  - **Missiles and Projectiles:** Different types of ammo are used to interact with enemies and other objects.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can shoot missiles, and specific interactions with aliens can either result in score changes or damage.\n  - The base takes damage from bombs and aliens, and the player loses if the avatar is destroyed or if the base is attacked.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal of the game is to defend the base while defeating as many enemy aliens as possible. The player must score points by destroying aliens but also needs to prevent them from damaging the base.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if all alien spawn points are destroyed (no portals left and no aliens remaining).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is destroyed or if the number of avatars reaches zero.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Defense Focus:** Prioritize protecting the base. Keep an eye on the production of alien enemies from the portals and plan your movements accordingly.\n2. **Resource Management:** Use your missiles carefully. Make sure to time your shots to maximize the damage against enemies while conserving ammo.\n3. **Targeting Enemies:** Target weaker alien types first to clear the battlefield and prevent overload from stronger enemies.\n4. **Positioning:** Stay mobile and avoid getting cornered. Use the edges of the screen to your advantage, retreating strategically if overwhelmed.\n5. **Score Maximization:** Focus on killing enemies that provide score bonuses (like using 'sam' against aliens) while avoiding enemies that negatively affect your score or damage your avatar.\n6. **Monitor Spawn Points:** Regularly check on remaining portals, and attempt to destroy them before they spawn more enemies, utilizing the timing of alien spawn cooldowns.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively manage threats, protect their base, and achieve victory in this fast-paced shooting game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
