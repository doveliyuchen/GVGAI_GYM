There are elements of strategy as players must manage the positioning and timing of shooting while avoiding enemies and projectiles.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - **Player Avatar:** The player controls a spaceship represented by the 'avatar' sprite.\n  - **Enemies:** There are two types of aliens ('alienGreen' and 'alienBlue') that spawn from portals, posing threats to the player.\n  - **Projectiles:** The game involves shooting missiles (presumably at enemies) and dealing with different types of projectiles (bombs and enemy fire).\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can kill aliens and receive score changes for certain interactions (e.g., scoring when shooting regular aliens).\n  - Collisions between the avatar and enemies, or their projectiles, can lead to score penalties or loss of life.\n  - The avatar can use 'sam' (bullets) to destroy aliens for points, and the base can destroy both bombs and missiles.\n\n- **Enemy Behavior:**\n  - Aliens have cooldown mechanics; they spawn at set intervals and have specific behaviors when interacting with the avatar.\n  \n**Objectives:**\n- The main objectives involve scoring points by destroying aliens while avoiding being hit by their projectiles. \n- The player must also manage to prevent aliens from reaching the base, which appears to be a central defensive structure.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if there are no remaining aliens (i.e., the `MultiSpriteCounter` for portals and aliens reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's counter (lives) reaches zero.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Positioning:** \n   - Always keep your avatar moving to avoid enemy fire and bombs. Use the layout to create distance from the spawn points of the aliens.\n\n2. **Focus on Targets:** \n   - Prioritize shooting the aliens over worrying about the bombs, as killing aliens contributes to your score and reduces the threat to the base.\n\n3. **Utilize Power-ups or Advantages:** \n   - If there are power-ups or special abilities (not explicitly mentioned), make use of them to gain an upper hand against the enemy.\n\n4. **Manage Your Resources:** \n   - Pay attention to the 'sam' ammunition, if applicable, to ensure you always have enough to fend off incoming aliens.\n\n5. **Defensive Playstyle:** \n   - Occasionally retreat to put distance between yourself and multiple enemies. Use the base to your advantage, allowing it some cover while still engaging enemies.\n\n6. **Optimize Kill Opportunities:** \n   - Look for opportunities to kill multiple aliens at once or set up traps where their spawn patterns collide.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through the challenges presented within the game effectively while maximizing their score and ensuring their survival against enemy assaults.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
