It involves navigating a grid-like layout, using bombs to interact with the environment, and potentially defeating enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features several key sprites, including:\n   - **Bomberman**: The player's primary avatar, capable of placing bombs.\n   - **Enemies (Bats, Spiders, Scorpions)**: Randomly moving NPCs that can harm the player.\n   - **Bombs**: The primary tool for interacting with the environment and defeating enemies.\n   - **Walls and Wall Breaks**: Obstacles that require bombs to destroy.\n   - **Goal (Green Door)**: The target destination for winning.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player can **place bombs** to destroy walls and enemies.\n   - Bombs can detonate in multiple directions, causing chain reactions (explosions).\n   - Contact with enemies or being caught in an explosion results in death for the Bomberman.\n   - Reaching the goal (green door) results in a victory.\n\n3. **Sprite Counter**: The game tracks the number of Bomberman sprites (player's life/counter) and goal sprites (for winning). If all lives are lost, the game ends in defeat; if the goal is reached, the game ends in victory.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, defeat enemies using strategically placed bombs, and ultimately reach the green door (goal) to win the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully reach the green door.\n- **Loss Condition**: Have all Bomberman avatars eliminated (lives go to 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Exploration**: Take your time to learn the layout of the map. Identify where walls can be destroyed and where enemies appear.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement**:\n   - Place bombs strategically near walls to create paths and clear out enemy threats.\n   - Try to set up chain reactions by placing bombs in a way that causes nearby bombs to explode, maximizing damage.\n\n3. **Enemy Management**:\n   - Use bombs to defeat enemies safely while maintaining distance to avoid getting hit.\n   - Pay attention to enemy cooldowns and movement patterns; plan your bomb placement accordingly.\n\n4. **Careful Navigation**:\n   - Move cautiously and avoid stepping directly into paths where enemies are present unless you have a strategy in place to deal with them (like having bombs ready).\n   - Use walls to your advantage by leading enemies into positions where you can effectively eliminate them.\n\n5. **Focus on the Goal**:\n   - Don\u2019t get distracted by defeating all enemies; prioritize reaching the goal once you have secured safe paths.\n   - Ensure you have enough bomb count to navigate to the green door while dealing with any last-minute enemies.\n\nBy balancing resource management (bombs), careful movement, and strategic bomb placements, players can navigate the level effectively and achieve victory in this strategic puzzle/action game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'e'\nbomb_8 -> 'f'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'h'\nbomb_7 -> 'i'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'j'\nbomb_6 bomb_9 -> 'k'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'l'\nbomb_5 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'm'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_4 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'o'\nbomb_1 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'p'\nbomb_3 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'q'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> @\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> g\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> p\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> q\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> &\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> &\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "Given the current state and the layout of the map, I can analyze the situation as follows:\n\n- My avatar (Bomberman) is located at (4, 9) and is surrounded by certain obstacles and enemy NPCs:\n  - To the left (4, 8) is a bomb sprite ('g'), which I can pick up.\n  - To the right (4, 10) is another bomb sprite ('p').\n  - Below (5, 9) is an enemy (scorpion, '%').\n  - Above (3, 9) is an empty space.\n\nThe immediate goal is to either collect bombs or clear paths to reach the green door at (1, 11) safely while managing the enemy threats.\n\n### Analysis Based on Rules and Strategy:\n1. **Movement Strategy**: Since I haven't moved yet, I should consider moving to collect bombs first. Collecting bombs is critical for both offense and defense, enabling me to place more effectively when engaging with enemies.\n  \n2. **Safety from Enemies**: The scorpion is right below me at (5, 9), so I need to make sure not to move downward unless I can guarantee safe movement after, given I can be harmed.\n\n3. **Next Move**: The best immediate action, instead of moving down directly toward the enemy, would be to collect the nearby bomb to the left or right. Given I'm positioned at (4, 9), it makes sense to move left to (4, 8) and pick up the bomb.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nCollecting the bomb on my left is safe and aligns with the strategy of resource management and moving towards the goal. I expect this will set me up to better navigate the area while dealing with enemies and walls effectively.",
