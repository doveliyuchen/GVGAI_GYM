    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, this appears to be a maze-like strategic puzzle/adventure game with elements reminiscent of Bomberman. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different aspects of the game:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game could be classified as a **Puzzle/Action** genre. Players are maneuvering around a grid-like environment while placing and strategically using bombs to achieve specific objectives.\n\n### Mechanics:\n- **Movement:** Players control the \"bomberman\" who can move around the grid, interact with various items, and navigate obstacles.\n- **Bomb Placement:** The primary mechanic revolves around placing bombs (different types) to break walls (both regular walls and walls that can be broken) and defeat enemies.\n- **Goal:** The main objective is to reach the goal (the green door) while navigating through the maze, defeating enemies and avoiding getting trapped or killed.\n- **Enemies:** There are multiple types of opponents (bats, spiders, scorpions) which aim to kill the player. \n- **Bomb Types:** There are multiple bomb types (bomb_1 to bomb_10), and each can be placed to interact with walls or enemies, leading to explosions that can damage or eliminate them.\n- **Scoring System:** Players earn points by reaching the goal or eliminating enemies, while losing points or lives if certain conditions are met (such as being killed by an enemy or an explosion).\n\n### Objective:\n- Successfully navigate through the maze to reach the goal (the green door).\n- Use bombs effectively to eliminate enemies and break through walls.\n- Accumulate points by killing enemies and reaching the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win:** The player wins if they reach the goal, with a score change of +10.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if their bomberman sprite count reaches 0, indicating they have been killed.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Map:** Understand the layout of the maze, identifying paths you can take and the locations of enemies.\n2. **Plan Bomb Placement:** Use bombs wisely. Consider placing bombs near walls to create new paths or near enemies to eliminate them safely. Don't trap yourself while doing this.\n3. **Avoid Enemy Encounters:** Always be aware of enemy positions and their cooldown times. Use walls as barriers to stay safe while figuring out the best moves.\n4. **Use Bombs to Control Space:** The explosions can help manage space and create routes to the goal. Try to create multiple pathways to confuse enemies and allow yourself escape routes.\n5. **Collect Points:** Focus on defeating enemies and breaking walls that can lead you to the goal.\n6. **Stay Alive:** Keep an eye on your health and avoid reckless bomb placements that could lead to self-damage.\n\nWith careful planning and strategic bomb placements, players can progress through the maze and achieve the objective while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'e'\nbomb_8 -> 'f'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'h'\nbomb_7 -> 'i'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'j'\nbomb_6 -> 'k'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 -> 'l'\nbomb_5 bomb_9 -> 'm'\nbomb_1 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_4 bomb_8 -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> @\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> o\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> n\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> &\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> &\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "Given the current state and layout of the game, my bomberman (represented by '#') is positioned at (5, 8). There are several walls and enemies nearby, particularly:\n\n- a spider (&) at (6, 8)\n- a goal wall ($) at (1, 11)\n\nThe goal is to reach the green door while navigating through the maze, eliminating enemies if possible. My primary concern right now is the spider directly below me, at (6, 8), which is a threat.\n\n### Strategy and Action\n\nTo deal with the spider at (6, 8) and to create a pathway towards the goal at (1, 11), I should initially place a bomb to eliminate the spider. The surrounding environment allows for this as there are breakable walls (b) nearby to manage space and potentially open up new paths. \n\nI will place the bomb directly above the spider, at my current position (5, 8), since I can control the space around me and deal with the immediate threat.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action involves using my bomb at my current location, with the expectation that it will explode and remove the spider from the game while creating more of a pathway. The goal is to ensure my safety and progress towards reaching the door by managing threats and obstacles effectively!",
