    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to fit within the **action puzzle** genre. This is suggested by the use of bombs to manipulate the environment (like destroying walls and defeating enemies) while navigating through a map to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game has different types of sprites including walls, enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions), bombs, and a goal (green door).\n   - The **bomberman** character can place bombs to blow up walls and kill enemies.\n   - Environment interactions include explosions affecting walls and spawning new bombs from destructible objects.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The bomberman can interact with walls and obstacles, retreating when encountering them.\n   - Bombs can be set off to eliminate enemies, destroy walls, and clear the path to the goal.\n   - Different types of bombs seem to increase in power or effect, with more powerful bombs having longer durations or larger explosions.\n\n3. **Explosion Dynamics**:\n   - The explosions have directional effects, potentially impacting multiple tiles around the detonation point.\n   - There\u2019s a visual progression of the explosion from left to right, up, and down.\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary objective is to reach the green door (goal) while navigating through a grid-like layout filled with walls and enemies.\n- Additionally, players can gain score points by defeating enemies and breaking down walls.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the goal (`goal bomberman > killSprite scoreChange=10`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the bomberman is eliminated (sprite counter for `bomberman limit=0 win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Understand the layout of walls (`w`) and pathways (`.`). Identify key locations for spawning bombs and the positions of enemies.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement**:\n   - Strategically place bombs to create paths through walls or defeat enemies without being caught in the explosion. \n   - Pay attention to the cooldown of enemies to plan your moves and bomb placements accordingly.\n\n3. **Avoiding Enemy Contact**: \n   - Stay clear of enemies and anticipate their movements. Use walls as shields. If enemies can be defeated through bomb placement, do so from a safe distance.\n\n4. **Exploring**: \n   - Explore the map to find potential bomb spawns and keep an eye out for safe spots to retreat if enemies come too close.\n   - Utilize enemy defeat for points to potentially allow for better bomb placements later in the game.\n\n5. **Timing Explosions**: \n   - Timing is critical; don\u2019t be near bombs when they detonate. Utilize the post-explosion chaos to move safely through previously blocked areas while avoiding remaining threats.\n\nIn conclusion, mastering bomb placement and understanding enemy patterns will be crucial to successfully navigate through levels, achieve your goal, and score points along the way.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_7 bomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> @\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> k\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> g\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> &\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, I can see that my avatar (bomberman) is positioned at (row=4, col=9) with a goal to reach the green door located at (row=1, col=11). There are several walls and enemies within the vicinity, and I must avoid direct contact with them while progressing towards my goal.\n\n### Situation Analysis:\n- **Avatar**: At (4, 9)\n- **Goal**: At (1, 11)\n- **Key Obstacles**: Walls ('*') obstructing paths towards the goal. \n- **Enemies**: Bats ('@') at (1, 4) and (1, 15) as well as a scorpion ('%') at (1, 9). \n- **Bombs**: I can place bombs to potentially clear paths or defeat enemies.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo get closer to the goal while managing enemies:\n1. I will look for breaks in walls to see if I can create a path.\n2. If I can place a bomb to destroy some blocks, it would allow me to proceed toward the goal while avoiding the dangers from the enemies.\n\nCurrently, I'm positioned near walls and bombs. The next step is to plan my move effectively. I still have many wall blocks around me and I need space to maneuver:\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the situation, I can take advantage of the bomb located at (4, 8) which is next to me. I will opt to use a bomb to clear the wall at (4, 8) in hopes of creating a path towards the goal:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should allow me to clear a wall and create a more strategic position for further moves. I expect this will align with my strategy to navigate effectively towards the green door.",
