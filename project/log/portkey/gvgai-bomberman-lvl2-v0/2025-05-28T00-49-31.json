The interaction of characters and environmental elements, particularly with obstacles and enemies, suggests a blend of strategic puzzle-solving and action gameplay similar to **Bomberman** styles.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites and Objects:** The game features various sprites like walls, bombs, explosions, and characters such as the bomberman and enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions). The spatial arrangement of these objects creates a maze-like setting.\n- **Bomb Mechanic:** Bombs can be placed strategically by the bomberman, causing explosions which have wider effects on surroundings (destroying walls and enemies).\n- **Enemy Types:** Different enemies have varied cooldowns and consistencies which might affect their movement and attack patterns, adding a layer of strategy.\n- **Goal Mechanic:** The ultimate objective is to reach the green door (goal) while avoiding death.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to have the bomberman reach the goal (the green door) while navigating through a maze-like environment and strategically using bombs to eliminate enemies or obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the green door sprite while the bomberman remains alive.\n- **Loss Condition:** The bomberman loses if it collides with enemies or triggers an explosion, resulting in a game over.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Identify possible pathways towards the goal and anticipate enemy movement patterns.\n\n2. **Strategic Bomb Placement:**\n   - Use bombs not only offensively to eliminate enemies but also defensively to create pathways through walls.\n   - Place bombs near groups of enemies or obstructive walls but keep a safe distance to avoid being caught in the blast.\n\n3. **Enemy Movement Patterns:**\n   - Observe the behavior of different enemies: bats, spiders, and scorpions will have different patterns due to their cooldowns.\n   - Use this knowledge to lure enemies into bomb explosions or to safely bypass them while avoiding direct contact.\n\n4. **Timing of Moves:**\n   - Time your movements and bomb placements to avoid being cornered by enemies or caught in the explosion\u2019s area of effect.\n   - If an enemy is nearby, be cautious of when to place a bomb as it may attract their attention.\n\n5. **Control Bomb Count:**\n   - Manage the number of bombs available. Don\u2019t use them recklessly; keep some for emergencies or strategic dismantling of enemies.\n\n6. **Points and Scoring:**\n   - Focus on maximizing score opportunities by destroying enemies with explosions and activating the goal as soon as possible.\n   - Score points not just for reaching the goal but also by ensuring efficient use of bombs and enemy eliminations.\n\nBy employing these strategies effectively and adapting based on the specific level's layout and enemy behavior, players can achieve the game\u2019s objective while maintaining a high score and avoiding the loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_5 -> 'e'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'f'\nbomb_4 -> 'h'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'i'\nbomb_3 -> 'j'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'k'\nbomb_2 -> 'l'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'm'\nbomb_1 -> 'n'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'o'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'p'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'q'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 -> 'r'\nbomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 't'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> @\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> r\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> t\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> &\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "The current state shows that the bomberman (represented by '#') is located at (row 4, col 9) and surrounded by walls (indicated by '*' and 'b'), enemies (spider '&' at (4, 6) and bats '@' nearby at (1, 1) and (2, 18)), and an essential goal wall ($) at (1, 11). \n\nTo pursue the objective of reaching the goal while avoiding enemies, my current position is critical. I am currently safe but need to plan my next move strategically. Here are the important points:\n\n1. **Enemy Analysis**: The spider on (4, 6) could potentially pose a threat if I move in its proximity. I need to keep distance from it while pursuing access to the goal.\n2. **Bomb Count**: I have a bomb available but it is unclear how many I can deploy at this moment. I should use it wisely to either create paths or eliminate nearby enemies.\n3. **Path Analysis**: The immediate path towards the goal (1, 11) is through a series of walls and requires strategic leveraging of my bombs.\n\nGiven this state and the need to act differently from the last state, I will consider moving to the left to (row 4, col 8), which is an empty space, allowing for further exploration without directly engaging enemies.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis move allows me to safely navigate towards a more advantageous position while keeping an eye on the enemies.",
