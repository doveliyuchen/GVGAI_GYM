    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules provided, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fit within the **Puzzle/Action** genre. It combines strategic placement mechanics with an action element involving avoiding or defeating enemies and utilizing explosions (bombs) to navigate and achieve goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various characters and objects are represented as sprites, with specific interactions between them (e.g., bomberman, enemies, walls, bombs).\n- **Bomb Placement**: The player controls a character (bomberman) that can place bombs, which will explode after a cooldown period, damaging both enemies and destructible walls.\n- **Explosions**: Bombs create explosions that can affect surrounding sprites, with directional effects.\n- **Enemy Movement**: Some NPCs act randomly, providing unpredictability to the gameplay.\n- **Goal**: The goal is represented as a green door that must be reached for the player to win.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to guide the bomberman to the goal (the green door) while managing resources (bombs) and navigating through enemies and obstacles.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the bomberman sprite is destroyed (SpriteCounter for bomberman reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Bomb Management**: Use bombs wisely. Given that bombs can destroy both enemies and walls, plan their placement to maximize explosion coverage while minimizing self-harm.\n  \n2. **Positioning**: Keep moving to avoid enemy attacks and to find safe spots to place bombs. Use walls strategically for cover and to funnel enemies into bomb impact zones.\n\n3. **Enemy Avoidance**: Since enemies can randomly move, pay attention to their positions and movement patterns. It's often more effective to avoid them instead of confronting them directly.\n\n4. **Navigating Obstacles**: Break through walls strategically with bombs when necessary, but avoid getting too close to enemy sprites or placed bombs that might backfire.\n\n5. **Timing and Awareness**: Be conscious of the cooldowns on bomb placements and enemy movements. Timed explosions can be used to clear paths or trigger chain reactions to deal with multiple enemies or obstacles effectively.\n\n6. **Explore and Expand**: As you move toward the goal, explore surrounding areas to find additional bombs which can enhance your chances of successfully navigating the level.\n\nUtilize these strategies to optimize your gameplay experience, ensuring you reach the goal while avoiding defeat from enemies or missteps involving your own bomb placements.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> %\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> &\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> &\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> j\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "Given the current state, the important details are:\n\n- The avatar (bomberman represented by '#') is located at (row=7, col=11).\n- The goal (represented by '$') is located at (row=1, col=11).\n- There are walls surrounding the avatar, but there are also viable paths available.\n- The direction of movement is crucial due to the presence of enemies, specifically a spider ('&') above at (row=6, col=18) and another one at (row=7, col=9).\n\nThe strategic approach suggests:\n1. **Avoiding enemies** is key, as confronting them head-on is risky.\n2. Utilize bomb placement wisely to clear paths but avoid getting trapped or hitting yourself.\n3. We need to navigate to the goal (green door) at (row=1, col=11) while ensuring we do not get damaged.\n\nSince there is a spider adjacent to the avatar on its right, moving directly to the right is not ideal. Instead, a more beneficial action would be to move **up** towards a safer location without engaging the nearby spider.\n\nThus, the next action will be to move up:\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis move allows for repositioning towards a safer area and gets closer to the goal, aligning with the overall gameplay strategy. I expect to see the avatar successfully navigating away from immediate danger.",
