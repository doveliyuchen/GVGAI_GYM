Players navigate a maze-like environment while strategically using bombs to defeat enemies and reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\n1. **Sprites and Environment:**\n   - The game contains various sprites such as walls, bombs, enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions), and a goal (green door).\n   - The environment includes solid walls that the player can\u2019t pass through, as well as breakable walls. \n\n2. **Bomb Mechanics:**\n   - The player uses bombs to attack enemies and break certain walls (wallBreak).\n   - Bombs can explode in four directions and have a cascading effect, potentially causing chain reactions.\n\n3. **Enemies:**\n   - Enemies are random NPCs that may vary in strength (indicated by their cooldowns and cons values). The player must factor in their movement and behavior when planning attacks.\n\n4. **Interactions:**\n   - Contact with enemies results in loss, while reaching the goal earns points.\n   - Explosions can eliminate enemies and clear paths to the goal.\n   - The player must manage bomb placement carefully to avoid self-damage.\n\n### Objectives and Win/Loss Conditions\n\n- **Objective:** \n  The primary goal is to reach the green door (goal) while defeating enemies and navigating through the maze.\n  \n- **Win Condition:** \n  - Reach the goal (the green door), which grants points and allows victory.\n  \n- **Lose Condition:** \n  - Running out of lives (SpriteCounter for bomberman reaching zero) results in game over.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Understanding:**\n   - Get a clear view of the maze layout. Look for efficient paths to the goal while avoiding enemies.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement:**\n   - Use bombs to create pathways by breaking walls but be mindful of the chain reaction that can occur with bomb explosions.\n   - Aim bombs at enemy positions to eliminate them while giving yourself a safe distance.\n\n3. **Enemy Management:**\n   - Observe enemy movement patterns before launching an attack. Timing is crucial; place bombs when enemies are near, but ensure you\u2019re not caught in the explosion.\n\n4. **Chain Reactions:**\n   - Utilize bomb chain reactions to maximize damage \u2013 place bombs in such a way that one explosion triggers others, potentially taking out multiple enemies or clearing more walls.\n\n5. **Safety Precautions:**\n   - Always have an escape route in mind. If enemies get too close or a bomb goes off unexpectedly close to you, plan a quick exit.\n\n6. **Resource Management:**\n   - Be mindful of how many bombs you use and the configuration of bomb types (as indicated by bomb sprites). Don't waste bombs on weak enemies if it will cost you in the long run.\n\n7. **Focus on Goal:**\n   - Prioritize reaching the goal once the path is clear, rather than attempting to eliminate every enemy. Points are earned through reaching the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate the challenges presented by the game effectively and maximize their chances of victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'i'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> @\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> k\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> &\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "Given the current game state, our avatar (bomberman, represented by `#`) is located at (4, 9). We have various obstacles and enemies around us, including:\n\n- Breakable walls (`b`) at several positions.\n- Enemies (`@` and `&`) in proximity, specifically:\n  - A bat at (1, 16)\n  - A bat at (2, 2)\n  - A spider at (4, 6)\n  \nThe ultimate objective is to reach the goal represented by `$`, which is located at (1, 11). To do this, we might need to strategically use bombs to break walls or eliminate enemies.\n\nCurrently, there is a breakable wall (`b`) to the left of our avatar at (4, 8) and another at (4, 7). Breaking at least one of these walls will clear a path, so placing a bomb is a great first action.\n\nBefore acting, I will carefully analyze the surrounding enemies to ensure I am not putting myself in danger while attempting to make a move:\n\n1. The enemy positions can influence bomb detonation.\n2. The move toward the bomb placement should ensure a safe distance from the enemy at (4, 6).\n\nI will place a bomb immediately at (4, 8) to break the wall. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will activate the bomb, clearing a wall, which is a crucial step towards reaching the goal while mitigating potential threats in the future. I expect this to make progress towards clearing a path to the goal effectively.",
