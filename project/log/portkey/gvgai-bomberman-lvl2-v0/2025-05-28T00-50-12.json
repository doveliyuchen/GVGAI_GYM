    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **maze-style puzzle game** possibly with elements of battle or strategy. Given the references to bombs and explosions, it shares similarities with classic games like \u201cBomberman,\u201d which focus on navigating a map, placing bombs, and defeating enemies while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - Players control a character referred to as **'bomberman'**, who can place bombs that explode in four directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - The player can interact with various elements like walls and enemies:\n     - Bombs can destroy walls and enemies.\n     - Players must avoid enemy attacks and their own bombs, as the explosion can also harm the bomberman.\n     - Specific interactions lead to score changes based on kills or actions completed.\n\n2. **Bomb Management**:\n   - Various bomb types (from bomb_1 to bomb_10) are spawned and can kill objects upon interaction with the background. \n   - Careful management of bombs is important; placing bombs effectively to break walls or defeat enemies is crucial.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objectives are:\n- **Reach the Goal**: The 'goal' sprite is the exit door (green color), and the player should aim to reach this door to win the game.\n- **Survival**: The player must avoid being killed by explosions, enemies, and any environmental hazards.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if the **'goal'** sprite is reached (indicated by the condition of killing the 'goal' sprite resulting in a score change).\n- The player loses if the **'bomberman'** sprite runs out of lives, indicated by a SpriteCounter limit of zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Familiarity**: Understand the layout of walls and paths quickly. The level layout you've shared suggests clear pathways and obstacles.\n  \n2. **Bomb Placement**: Be strategic about where to place bombs. You might want to use bombs to:\n   - Clear walls to create pathways.\n   - Trap enemies and limit their movement.  \n   - Ensure you have a safe distance when detonating bombs to avoid self-inflicted damage.\n\n3. **Enemy Management**: Monitor the enemy movements (like NPCs: bats, spiders, scorpions). Use bombs to eliminate them while positioning yourself safely.\n\n4. **Score Optimization**: \n\n   - Focus on achieving as many kills as possible (which gives score bonuses) to improve your position and resource management (the spawning of bombs).\n   - Aim for the 'goal' only after clearing enough space and securing your pathway.\n\n5. **Avoiding Unnecessary Risks**: Don\u2019t place bombs in ways that may corner you into a hazardous situation. Plan your pathways and exits wisely.\n\nIn summary, the game is about navigating a hazardous environment while strategically placing bombs to remove obstacles and defeat enemies. A systematic approach involving planning and safe distancing will lead to successful gameplay.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_3 explosionUp -> 'k'\nexplosionDown -> 'l'\nexplosionLeft -> 'm'\nexplosionRight -> 'n'\nbomb_2 explosionUp -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> #\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> o\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> m\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> n\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> l\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> &\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",
