The primary focus is on strategic positioning, resource management, and spatial awareness.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Turn-Based Actions:** The game likely involves turn-based mechanics where the player (the bomberman) can place bombs to clear obstacles, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach a goal.\n- **Bomb Placement:** Players can place bombs to destroy walls and enemies. Each bomb has a specific countdown and area of effect, causing explosions that can eliminate nearby threats and destructible environment elements.\n- **Enemy AI:** Enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions) seem to have randomized movements or behaviors, introducing unpredictability into the gameplay. They can also be eliminated using strategically placed bombs.\n- **Scoring System:** Actions yield points (e.g., defeating enemies, reaching the goal), which may contribute to game progression or bonus opportunities.\n- **Goals and Obstacles:** The ultimate objective is to reach the goal (green door) while managing enemies and avoiding obstacles.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The player's main objective is to navigate through the level to reach the green door (goal).\n- Defeating enemies and clearing paths by using bombs denoted in the level layout is also vital to success.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal (green door) before their bombs run out or they are defeated.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the bomberman is killed by explosions or enemies, which results in a loss.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout to identify safe paths to the goal and locations of walls to be destroyed.\n  \n2. **Controlled Bomb Placement:** Place bombs strategically to clear paths while minimizing the risk of the bomberman being caught in the explosion or trapped by enemies. Plan for the timing of explosions to clear enemies while moving towards the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Explosions Effectively:** Make use of chain reactions by placing bombs next to destructible walls to maximize damage and clear areas. Each bomb can lead to further explosions that can clear multiple enemies or obstacles.\n\n4. **Enemy Management:** Watch the movements of enemy sprites. It's often beneficial to lure enemies into positions where you can destroy them with bomb explosions rather than engaging them directly.\n\n5. **Scoring Consideration:** As points are acquired from defeating enemies and reaching the goal, think about taking calculated risks to maximize your score while still working towards the goal.\n\n6. **Adaptability:** Be ready to adapt your strategy based on enemy movements and new bombs that can be spawned from destroyed walls. React quickly to the dynamic environment.\n\n7. **Survival First:** While accumulating points is rewarding, prioritize keeping the bomberman alive. Avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to an early end to the game.\n\nIn summary, this game combines strategy and action through explosive puzzle mechanics, where careful planning and spatial awareness can lead you to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'd'\nbomb_5 -> 'e'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'f'\nbomb_4 -> 'h'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'i'\nbomb_3 -> 'j'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'k'\nbomb_2 -> 'l'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'm'\nbomb_1 -> 'n'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'o'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'p'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'q'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> @\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> q\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> r\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> &\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "In the current state, my position as the bomberman (#) is at (4, 9). There's one enemy (the spider &) located at (6, 5) below me, and I also see a wallBreak at (1, 6) which would allow me to use a bomb to potentially clear some paths.\n\nGiven these observations, my immediate goal should be to either move towards already destructible walls or the goal (denoted by $ at (1, 11)). To approach the exit, I could use bombs effectively on walls or enemies blocking my path.\n\nThe strategy recommendation includes ensuring not to engage the spider directly while planning bomb placements. I should move using safe directional actions to navigate around obstacles and enemies. \n\nSince I'm not currently in any danger and there's an opportunity to use the wallBreak to clear some paths towards my goal, I'll first check the area around me to confirm safe moves or other bomb placements.\n\nAs I look at the available actions:\n\n1. I can go LEFT (4, 8), RIGHT (4, 10), UP (3, 9), DOWN (5, 9).\n\nTo move towards clearing a wall and possibly gain a tactical positioning, let's move UP to (3, 9).\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nI expect this will get me closer to strategizing my next move effectively towards the goal while staying clear of enemy threats.",
