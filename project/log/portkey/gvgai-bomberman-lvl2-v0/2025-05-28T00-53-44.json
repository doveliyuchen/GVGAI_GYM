    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThe game described appears to fit into the **Puzzle / Action** genre, with elements of strategic positioning and resource management, likely inspired by classic titles like **Bomberman**. \n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites including:\n   - The main character (bomberman) who can place bombs.\n   - Enemies that can harm the player.\n   - Environment elements like walls and destructible blocks.\n   - A goal represented by a door.\n\n2. **Bomb Mechanics**:\n   - Players can place bombs that cause explosions, which can destroy walls, enemies, and potentially the bomberman itself if not careful.\n   - The explosion has directional propagation, which affects adjacent sprites.\n\n3. **Enemy Mechanics**:\n   - Enemies (like bats, spiders, and scorpions) move randomly and can harm the bomberman.\n\n4. **Interactions**:\n   - The bomberman can interact with walls, bombs, and enemies.\n   - Bomb placement and subsequent detonations are key to both offense (killing enemies) and defense (clearing paths).\n\n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to reach the **goal (green door)**, with the player needing to strategically navigate the environment and handle threats from enemies.\n- The game also rewards the player for defeating enemies and destroying blocks, which ties into the scoring system.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal (the green door).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the bomberman\u2019s sprite count drops to zero (i.e., the bomberman is defeated).\n\n#### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Bomb Placements**: Before placing bombs, think about their impact zones and how they can eliminate enemies or clear walls to create pathways. \n\n2. **Avoid Enemy Engagement**: Try to lure enemies into bomb blasts instead of confronting them directly. This minimizes risk and can lead to scoring opportunities.\n\n3. **Utilize Walls**: Use walls as cover. They can protect the bomberman from enemy attacks and shield against self-inflicted bomb damage.\n\n4. **Create Safe Zones**: Always have an escape route when planting bombs. Be aware of your surroundings to prevent getting trapped by your own explosions.\n\n5. **Watch Enemy Patterns**: Even though they are random, understanding enemy movement can help in planning bomb placements to catch them off guard.\n\n6. **Optimize Scoring**: If possible, aim to both reach the goal and maximize scores by destroying as many enemies and breakable walls as you can without sacrificing your safety.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through the levels more effectively while keeping the bomberman safe and targeting their objectives efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_7 explosionDown -> 'k'\nexplosionLeft -> 'l'\nexplosionRight -> 'm'\nexplosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_6 explosionDown -> 'o'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'p'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'q'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'r'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_9 -> 't'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_8 -> 'u'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_7 -> 'v'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_6 -> 'x'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> @\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=17 -> *\nrow=4, col=18 -> b\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> x\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> j\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> &\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",
