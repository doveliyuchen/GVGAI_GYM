    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a potential overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game belongs to the **puzzle platformer** genre. Players navigate a 2D environment, interacting with various elements to solve spatial and logic challenges while managing resources.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move around the game grid.\n2. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Represents traversable ground.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Wall**: An immovable object that blocks the avatar's path.\n   - **Coin**: Collectible items that provide points when the avatar interacts with them.\n   - **Switches**: Activate or deactivate depending on the avatar's interaction. They can transform into alternate states.\n3. **Scoring System**: The player gains or loses points by interacting with coins and switches. Collecting coins increases the score, while interacting with switches can lead to score deductions if misused.\n4. **Timers**: Each switch interaction gives the player a time boost, which is essential for completing the level within the time limit.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to collect as many coins as possible while managing the switches effectively to maximize score and time. \n- Players need to reach a score of zero or above before the timer runs out (1500 units of time).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully completing the level within the time limit (1500 units) without the score dropping to zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends if the score becomes negative or if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Coins**: Focus on gathering coins early in the game since they boost your score. Understand their locations and plan your path accordingly.\n2. **Efficient Switch Usage**: Be strategic when interacting with switches. Each switch interaction gives time, but choose wisely to avoid large score penalties:\n   - Use switch 1 for a minimum score penalty and short timer.\n   - Use switch 2 for more timer and higher score penalty but it has a worthwhile return if used correctly.\n   - Switch 3 is a moderate option; strategize the timing of using it.\n3. **Path Planning**: Given the wall layout, plan your movements to avoid getting stuck or blocked. This helps in managing your time and maximizing the score.\n4. **Timer Management**: Keep an eye on how much time you gain from switches. The longer you can keep the timer topped up while maintaining a positive score, the better.\n5. **Avoid Negative Interactions**: Pay close attention to the interactions that result in score penalties (like certain switches). Try to avoid repeating interactions that would continuously reduce your score.\n\nBy adopting a careful approach to movement, collecting coins, and managing switch interactions wisely, you can increase your chances of winning and achieving a high score in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch1 -> 's'\nfloor switch2 -> 'k'\nfloor switch3 -> 'p'\ncoin floor -> '@'\nfloor switch1n -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> a\nrow=1, col=6 -> k\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> p\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",

The nearby items are:\n\n- Coin (no relevant coin on the same row).\n- Switch 1 ('#') at (1, 2) which can impact score.\n- Switch 2 ('k') at (1, 6) which is located directly next to my avatar.\n- Wall ('w') blocks movement in all directions except for traversable tiles.\n\nFollowing the strategic analysis:\n1. I can interact with the switch at (1, 6), as it is right next to my current position. This will also potentially lengthen the timer.\n2. Since there are no coins in close proximity directly, I will prioritize using Switch 2 first; I should maximize the effects of switching while keeping track of my score.\n\nI will take the action to interact with Switch 2:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will help me gain a time boost, and it aligns with the overall strategy of improving time management while navigating through the level.",
