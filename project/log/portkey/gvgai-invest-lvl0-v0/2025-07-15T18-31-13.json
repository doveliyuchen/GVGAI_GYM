    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game falls under the platformer or puzzle genre, where the player navigates a space to collect items and interact with various elements in the environment.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes several static and dynamic sprites:\n   - **Floor**: A surface on which the avatar moves.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable obstacles that the avatar cannot cross.\n   - **Coins**: Collectible items that increase the player's score.\n   - **Switches**: Interactive elements that transform states and can affect the avatar's score and timer.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins to score points.\n   - The avatar interacts with switches that can either add time (thus extending gameplay) or negatively affect the score.\n   - The score is affected by both positive (collecting coins, activating switches) and negative (encountering negative results upon switch activation) interactions.\n\n3. **Timer**: Engaging with switches also adds time, which is crucial for winning within the provided time limit.\n\n4. **Winning and Losing**:\n   - **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach the time limit of 1500 without a game-over (which would occur if the avatar's sprite counter reaches zero).\n   - **Loss Condition**: If the sprite counter of the avatar reaches zero, the player loses.\n\n### Objective:\nThe objective of the game is to collect as many coins as possible while managing interactions with switches wisely to maximize score and extend the gameplay timer. \n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Prioritize Coin Collection**: As collecting coins increases the score, prioritization should be given to paths that allow for the maximum number of coin encounters.\n\n2. **Manage Switch Interactions**: Be strategic when interacting with switches. Each switch has a different score impact. Understand the consequences:\n   - Switch 1: +5 on activation, -8 on re-activation.\n   - Switch 2: +15 on activation, -22 on re-activation.\n   - Switch 3: +10 on activation, -15 on re-activation.\n   - Focus on switches that provide a higher score bonus per interaction, and avoid those that result in a large negative score.\n\n3. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the remaining gameplay time. Engage with switches that add the most time (like switch 2 with 60 seconds) when the situation allows.\n\n4. **Wall Avoidance**: Remember that interacting with walls results in stepping back without making progress. Plan movements carefully to avoid unnecessary setbacks.\n\n5. **Positioning**: Carefully navigate through the layout to ensure that movement does not lead to negative score conditions. Be prepared to adapt strategies based on the current score and time.\n\n6. **Play for Score**: The aim should be to maintain a positive score while extending game time, which can be achieved through a careful balance of coin collection and switch activation.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the rules, players can navigate through the game effectively and aim for high scores while avoiding penalties.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch1 -> 's'\nfloor switch2 -> 'k'\nfloor switch3 -> 'p'\ncoin floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> s\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> k\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> p\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> a\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
