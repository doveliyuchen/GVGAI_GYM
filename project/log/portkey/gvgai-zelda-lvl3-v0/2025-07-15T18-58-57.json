It involves exploration, item collection (key), and combat (involving the sword).\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interaction:**\n   - **Floor:** Represents the base where the avatar and other sprites interact.\n   - **Goal:** The player needs to reach this green door to win, but only after acquiring the key.\n   - **Key:** An essential item; collecting this allows the player to open the door.\n   - **Sword:** The player avatar can use this to kill enemies.\n   - **Enemies:** They include various monsters (bat, spider, scorpion), each with different speeds and cooldown rates for movement.\n   - **Avatar:** The player controls this sprite, which can shoot and collect items. There's a state where the avatar can be 'without key' or 'with key', influencing interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions:** \n   - Players can\u2019t pass doors without a key. Player must defeat enemies to score points; if the avatar is hit, it loses points.\n   - The avatar can transform from 'nokey' to 'withkey' upon collecting the key, changing its interactions with the goal.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - **Win:** Achieved when the avatar successfully reaches the goal after collecting the key.\n   - **Loss:** If the avatar is defeated by an enemy, it's game over.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is for the player (avatar) to navigate the level, collect the key, and use it to unlock the goal door while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore Carefully:** Navigate through the level while observing enemy patterns. Pay attention to the cooldown periods of enemies to time your movements effectively.\n\n2. **Collect the Key First:** Prioritize reaching the key to access the goal. The strategic collection of the key is essential for progressing toward victory.\n\n3. **Engage Enemies Wisely:** Utilize the sword effectively to defeat enemies and score points. Avoid unnecessary combat that may lead to losing health (or points).\n\n4. **Plan Your Route:** Look for the most efficient path to navigate to the key without getting cornered by enemies. Utilize walls for cover when needed and consider moving away from tightly-packed enemy clusters.\n\n5. **Stay Aware of Your States:** Keep track of whether you are in the 'nokey' or 'withkey' state, as this will dictate your interaction possibilities with the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of successfully completing the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> k\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I can analyze the map:\n\n- The avatar is currently at (row 6, col 1) in a 'nokey' state '*'.\n- The key is located at (row 4, col 1) represented by '#'.\n- The goal is located at (row 1, col 11) denoted by '@'.\n- There are enemies in the vicinity, particularly at (row 7, col 1) represented by a '$', which is a normal monster.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation:\n\n1. The primary goal is to reach the key first at (row 4, col 1) to transition from 'nokey' to 'withkey'.\n2. The avatar must navigate around walls and enemies without getting hit.\n3. The fastest route to the key appears to be moving upward through the empty spaces.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n\nSince the avatar is positioned at (row 6, col 1), moving up to (row 5, col 1) seems to be the most viable first action, as it is an empty space and leads closer to the key without encountering any enemies.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar up one space, and my expectation is to get closer to the key without encountering any enemies.",
