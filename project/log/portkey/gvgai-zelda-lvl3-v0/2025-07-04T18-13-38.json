    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided elements, the game can be categorized as an **action-adventure puzzle game**. Players navigate through a level, interact with various sprites, collect items, and defeat enemies, all while solving puzzles to reach the goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent the environment (walls, floors, goals), the player's avatar, items (like keys and swords), and enemies (monsters).\n- **Avatar**: The player's character can shoot a sword at enemies, and the ability to collect a key changes the avatar's state (from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n- **Enemies**: Different types of enemies (quick, normal, slow) with varying cooldowns and consequences when interacting with the player.\n- **Goals & Keys**: Collecting keys allows access to a goal, with different interactions resulting in scoring changes or transformations.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach the goal sprite while collecting the necessary keys.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the 'goal' sprite while in possession of a key, which is indicated by the interaction that adds to the score (`killSprite scoreChange=1`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated (interacts negatively with an enemy) indicated by `killSprite scoreChange=-1`.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Start by exploring to understand the layout and identify the locations of keys, walls, and enemies. Pay attention to how the walls restrict movement and where the goals are positioned.\n\n2. **Collect the Key**: Priority should be given to obtaining the key, which allows the player to access the goal. Find the key (usually a specific sprite you can interact with) and ensure you have it before approaching the goal.\n\n3. **Manage Encounters with Enemies**:\n   - Use the sword effectively to take out enemies; prioritize defeating quicker enemies first as they can damage you rapidly.\n   - Avoid unnecessary conflicts with enemies unless you're confident you can defeat them without taking damage.\n\n4. **Plan Movement**: Since there are various walls, plan your movements to ensure you can navigate smoothly while avoiding enemies and obstacles. Use the layout to your advantage by trapping enemies or creating distance.\n\n5. **Stay Aware of Health**: Monitor your avatar's health as you engage with enemies. If you're getting hit frequently, reassess your strategy and avoid combat until you can secure an advantageous position.\n\n6. **Use the Environment**: Understand that some parts of the level have walls that can be used strategically to block or funnel enemies, which will help in avoiding being surrounded.\n\n7. **Score Optimization**: Always aim for a positive score by engaging in enemy combat and capturing keys effectively. Spare health whenever possible to maintain a high surviving score.\n\nBy combining exploration, effective enemy management, planned movements, and a focus on objectives, players can successfully navigate through the level and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nsword -> 'm'\nnokey sword -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> &\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
