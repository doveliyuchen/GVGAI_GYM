It involves solving puzzles and navigating through a maze-like environment while engaging in combat.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different elements in the game:\n  - **Player Avatar**: Represents the player character (can be in two forms: with or without a key).\n  - **Enemies**: Different types of monsters that can harm the player.\n  - **Goal**: A locked door that the player can open with a key.\n  - **Key**: An item required to unlock the goal.\n  - **Walls**: Immoveable barriers that define the level layout.\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - The player can defeat enemies using a sword.\n  - The player must collect the key to unlock the goal.\n  - If the player encounters the goal without the key, they are pushed back.\n  - If the player collects the key, their state changes to \"with key\" which allows them to interact positively with the goal.\n  \n- **Movement**: The player navigates a grid-like environment, moving between various obstacles (walls), enemies, and pathways to reach the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the **goal (door)** and unlock it by acquiring the **key**. The player must avoid or defeat enemies and navigate through walls to successfully complete levels.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they unlock the door (goal) with the key. This is determined by the presence of the goal sprite with a key interaction.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite is defeated by enemies.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Start by exploring the level layout carefully, identifying the locations of enemies, walls, the goal, and the key.\n2. **Collect the Key**: Focus on finding and collecting the key from your initial movements. Avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies unless you're confident you can defeat them.\n3. **Manage Encounters**: Use your sword to defeat enemies, but be strategic about it. Engage only when necessary to conserve health and resources.\n4. **Plan Your Routes**: After obtaining the key, plan your movement to go back to the goal without being cornered by enemies.\n5. **Use Obstacles to Your Advantage**: Make use of the walls and movable barriers to create defensive positions or block enemies as you maneuver toward the goal.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can effectively navigate the game while balancing combat and puzzle-solving elements to reach the goal successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> &\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The goal ('@') is located at (1, 11).

After collecting the key, plan the route back to the goal.\n\n### Action to Take based on Current Position (assumed at 1, 1)\nI will perform the action to the left or right as that best situates towards reaching the key.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis means I'm moving down to collect the key, which aligns with the proposed strategy of obtaining it before approaching the goal.",
