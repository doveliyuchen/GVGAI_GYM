    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nHere\u2019s a plain\u2010language breakdown of the game\u2019s design and some advice for how to tackle it:\n\n1. Game Genre and Overall Feel  \n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a top\u2010down, maze\u2011 or puzzle-like arcade adventure.  \n\u2003\u2022 You navigate a grid\u2011based level full of walls, floors, key items, a locked door (\u201cgoal\u201d), and roaming enemies.  \n\u2003\u2022 The gameplay mixes exploration, simple combat (using a temporary \u201csword\u201d attack), and puzzle elements (finding and using a key).\n\n2. Core Mechanics  \n\u2003\u2022 Movement is done on a tiled layout (walls, floors, etc.).  \n\u2003\u2022 The player controls an \u201cavatar\u201d that can shoot a short\u2011lived sword attack.  \n\u2003\u2022 The level includes various non-player characters: fast, normal, and slow \u201cmonster\u201d enemies that move randomly.  \n\u2003\u2022 Collecting a key is crucial; note that collecting it changes a \u201cnokey\u201d sprite into one \u201cwithkey\u201d (this seems to represent the transformation of your character or an ally that now carries the key).  \n\u2003\u2022 Some interactions are \u201cpassive\u201d as well \u2013 for example, if a sprite without a key (nokey) bumps into a door (goal), it is blocked (\u201cstepBack\u201d). Only a sprite holding the key (withkey) can interact with the door to \u201copen\u201d it (the door is then killed and points are awarded).\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions  \n\u2003\u2022 Your overall objective is to complete the level by \u201copening\u201d the door (goal).  \n\u2003\u2022 To do that, you must (directly or indirectly) obtain the key so that you can interact properly with the door.  \n\u2003\u2022 You win when the goal sprite (door) is cleared from the level.  \n\u2003\u2022 You lose if your avatar is removed from play (likely by taking enemy damage or otherwise being \u201ckilled\u201d by an enemy).\n\n4. Suggested Overall Strategy  \n\u2003\u2022 First, explore the maze carefully to locate the key. The transformation rule (nokey + key \u2192 withkey) suggests that acquiring the key is essential before you can use the door.  \n\u2003\u2022 While searching, be mindful of enemy movement. The fast, normal, and slow monsters patrol the level randomly.  \n\u2003\u2022 Use your sword attack wisely. With a limited duration (a \u201cflicker\u201d effect) and a cap on how many attacks can be active, time your shots to take out enemies that block your path or threaten your progress.  \n\u2003\u2022 Avoid direct collisions with enemies using your avatar, since that interaction carries a score penalty and risks your survival.  \n\u2003\u2022 Once you \u2013 or your controlled sprite \u2013 has the key, head for the door. Note that only an entity carrying the key (the \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite) is allowed to \u201copen\u201d the door; the door will not respond to a sprite that hasn\u2019t acquired the key.  \n\u2003\u2022 Keep an eye on your surroundings and use cover (walls and floor patterns) to dodge monsters while advancing. Tactical retreats and waiting out enemy \u201ccooldowns\u201d (monsters\u2019 movement impulses) can be very effective.\n\nBy combining careful maze exploration, timely offense (sword attacks), and avoiding enemy collisions, you can safely secure the key and reach the door to win the level while keeping your score in the positive.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> m\nrow=1, col=4 -> %\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
