Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Setup:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a grid-based puzzle/maze game where you control an \u201cavatar\u201d navigating through corridors surrounded by walls and floors.\n\u2003\u2013 The level includes a variety of sprites: immovable walls and floors forming the structure, a goal door, a key (which the avatar must pick up), a short-lived sword attack ability, and several enemy types that move at different speeds.\n\n\u2022 Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Movement: The avatar moves around the maze, controlled by the player. Some objects like walls and floors are static, while there are also \u201cmovable\u201d sprites that may create dynamic challenges.\n\u2003\u2013 Collecting Items: The avatar starts without the key (\u201cnokey\u201d). When colliding with a key, the avatar transforms into \u201cwithkey,\u201d meaning that key is now in hand.\n\u2003\u2013 Using Weapons: The avatar can shoot a sword attack. This sword (an \u201cOrientedFlicker\u201d) can kill enemy sprites, awarding points when used successfully.\n\u2003\u2013 Enemies: There are multiple types of enemies (monsterQuick, monsterNormal, monsterSlow) that move randomly with different cooldowns, adding both timing and avoidance challenges.\n\u2003\u2013 Interactions: Several interactions govern what happens on collisions:\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa If the avatar (withkey) meets the goal door, the door is \u201ckilled\u201d (removed), likely signifying level completion and awarding a score.\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa Colliding with a key while in the nokey state transforms the avatar into a withkey state, gives a point boost, and removes the key.\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa Collisions between the sword and enemies (or enemies colliding with each other) change positions (step back) or remove sprites, affecting score accordingly.\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa If an enemy collides with the avatar, the player loses points \u2013 emphasizing the need for caution.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss:\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: The player must navigate the maze, acquire the key (transforming from nokey to withkey), and then reach the goal door. Along the way, managing enemy threats and using the sword attack are key to survival.\n\u2003\u2013 Win: The level is won when the avatar successfully interacts with the goal door after obtaining the key.\n\u2003\u2013 Loss: The level is lost if the avatar is \u201ckilled\u201d (removed), which might happen through excessive enemy contact or other hazards.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Exploration and Timing: Carefully navigate the maze while keeping an eye on enemy movements. Avoid direct enemy contact until you are prepared.\n\u2003\u2013 Key Priority: Focus on reaching and collecting the key early on. This transformation is essential since the avatar in the nokey state cannot pass through the goal door.\n\u2003\u2013 Tactical Use of the Sword: Use the sword attack strategically to eliminate or push back enemies when they get too close, maintaining the safety of your route.\n\u2003\u2013 Route Planning: Assess the layout to find the safest path toward both the key and then the goal door, factoring in enemy patrol areas and movable obstacles.\n\u2003\u2013 Score Management: Balance risks and rewards\u2014killing enemies with your sword increases your score, but being hit by enemies incurs penalties, so precision is important.\n\nIn summary, the game is about quickly planning your route through a dynamically challenging maze, picking up the key, and then reaching the door while managing enemy threats using tactical attacks. A cautious yet proactive approach, along with efficient use of your sword attack, is key to winning the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
