You control an avatar who must navigate a maze-like level while dealing with various obstacles and foes. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n\u2022 Game Genre and Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a maze/puzzle game with real-time action elements. Your avatar moves on a grid and can \u201cshoot\u201d a sword attack.\n\u2003\u2013 The world is made up of walls, floors, keys, doors, and several kinds of moving monsters.\n\u2003\u2013 The game mixes navigation (exploring the level and finding the best path), action (using the timed sword attack to deal with enemies), and a puzzle element (collecting the key to unlock the door).\n\n\u2022 Objective:\n\u2003\u2013 Your main goal is to open the door (the \u201cgoal\u201d sprite) to win the level.\n\u2003\u2013 However, you need to have picked up the key first. If you try to go to the door without the key, the game prevents you by making you \u201cstep back.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 You win when the door (goal) is removed from the level\u2014that is, after you\u2019ve successfully reached it with the key in hand.\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is killed (if all avatar sprites are gone) or if you suffer penalties from enemy interactions.\n\n\u2022 How the Pieces Fit Together:\n\u2003\u2013 At the start, your avatar is in a \u201cnokey\u201d state. When you come into contact with the key, you transform into a \u201cwithkey\u201d state. This change is necessary because only when you have the key can you approach the door.\n\u2003\u2013 There are several types of monsters that move randomly (some fast, some slow). They can be dealt with in two ways:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use your avatar\u2019s sword attack (which appears as a flickering sprite when you shoot) to eliminate enemies. Hitting an enemy with the sword gives you bonus points.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Avoid direct contact with enemies as collisions with them (if not handled with the sword) can reduce your score and even risk your avatar\u2019s life.\n\n\u2022 Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. First, focus on finding and grabbing the key. Since touching the key transforms your avatar (from \u201cnokey\u201d to \u201cwithkey\u201d) and boosts your score, it\u2019s an essential early step.\n\u20032. Once you have the key, carefully navigate the maze toward the door. Remember that without the key, the door will simply push you back.\n\u20033. Keep an eye on the monsters. Use your timed sword attack to clear or deter them rather than colliding directly, which can cost you points or lead to your demise.\n\u20034. Plan your path to avoid overly crowded sections where enemy movement is unpredictable. Sometimes a defensive approach\u2014waiting for enemies to drift away\u2014can be more effective.\n\u20035. Balance offense with caution. Engaging enemies with your sword can safely earn you extra points, but don\u2019t risk unnecessary combat if it puts you near danger.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re solving a maze-like puzzle where the correct order of actions (key, then door) matters, and you must also manage dynamic enemy threats in real time. A careful, patient approach that emphasizes key collection and smart use of your sword attack will give you the best chance of reaching the goal and winning the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
