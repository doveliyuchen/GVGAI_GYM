The game mixes exploration, item collection, and combat against roaming enemies.\n\nGame Genre:\n\u2022 Puzzle/strategy with real-time action elements.\n\u2022 Maze exploration with combat and item management.\n\nCore Mechanics:\n\u2022 Navigation & Maze Exploration: You move an avatar around a grid-based level filled with walls and floors.\n\u2022 Item Collection & Transformation: There is a key (orange) that, when collected by your avatar (\u201cnokey\u201d), transforms it into \u201cwithkey.\u201d Only the \u201cwithkey\u201d version can trigger the secret interaction needed for level completion.\n\u2022 Door/Goal Interaction: The green door (goal) won\u2019t respond if you\u2019re in the \u201cnokey\u201d state. When in \u201cwithkey\u201d form, colliding with the door causes the goal sprite to be \u201ckilled\u201d (removed) and gives you points, which in turn signals level completion.\n\u2022 Combat with Enemies: Various monsters (labeled \u201cmonsterQuick,\u201d \u201cmonsterNormal,\u201d \u201cmonsterSlow\u201d) roam the level. They move randomly with different speeds and reaction times. You have a sword attack (an oriented flicker with a limit of 5) that you can use to kill enemy sprites. However, if your avatar touches an enemy without using your sword, the avatar is killed (and you lose the game), with a negative score change.\n\u2022 Interactions with the Environment: Walls are immovable, and certain interactions (like bumping into a movable wall or encountering an enemy) trigger step-back responses, keeping movement strategic.\n\nObjective & Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2022 Your primary objective is to collect the key, thereby \u201cupgrading\u201d your avatar to the withkey form.\n\u2022 Once you\u2019re with the key, reach the door (goal) to win the level.\n\u2022 You lose the game if your avatar is killed (for example, through collision with enemies).\n\nOverall Strategy:\n1. Explore Carefully: Navigate the maze carefully. Identify where the key is located while plotting out a safe path that avoids tight clusters of roaming enemies.\n2. Collect the Key: Prioritize getting the key. When you collide with it as a \"nokey\" avatar, you transform to \u201cwithkey\u201d (a process that gives you extra points). This change is crucial because only with the key can you properly interact with the goal door.\n3. Combat Tactically: Use your sword attack wisely. With a limited flicker (attack) count, only engage enemies if they block your path or if evasion is not an option. Remember that direct contact with enemies without attacking results in immediate loss, so time your strikes to clear or deter threats.\n4. Plan Your Route to the Door: Once you have the key, adjust your path to the door. Keep an eye on the enemy patrols, and if needed, use the sword to temporarily clear a safe route.\n5. Avoid Unnecessary Risks: The level layout is maze-like, with walls and obstacles that can channel enemy movement. Use these to your advantage to block or avoid enemy paths.\n6. Monitor Enemy Behavior: Different monsters have different speeds (fast, normal, slow). Use knowledge of their random movement and cooldown periods to anticipate safe windows for advancing.\n\nIn summary, the game challenges you to balance careful navigation and time-sensitive combat. Collecting the key is essential, after which your focus shifts to safely reaching the goal door. With a mix of planned movement and judicious use of your sword, you can minimize contact with dangerous enemies while edging toward level completion.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> m\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> &\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
