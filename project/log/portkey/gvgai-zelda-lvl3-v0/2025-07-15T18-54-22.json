    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle/Action with Rogue-like elements. The level layout suggests a confined space, and the combination of enemies, items (key, sword), and a goal indicates a puzzle-solving aspect.\n\n**Objective:** Reach the `goal` (green door) with the `avatar` (player character).\n\n**Win Condition:** Eliminate all sprites of type `goal` (reach and open the door).\n\n**Loss Condition:** Eliminate all sprites of type `avatar` (the player dies).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls the `avatar` and can presumably move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Shooting:** The avatar can \"shoot\" a sword (`sword`) that's represented by the `ShootAvatar` behavior. This seems to be the primary method of attacking enemies. The `OrientedFlicker` on the sword probably means it appears as a quick slash in the direction the player is facing. `limit=5` likely means the avatar can only use the sword 5 times.\n*   **Key & Door:** The player needs to collect a `key` (orange) to open the `goal` (green door). Touching the key transforms the `avatar` from `nokey` to `withkey`.\n*   **Enemies:** Three types of enemies (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`) move randomly and harm the player. The names tell us that they move at different speeds.\n*   **Walls:** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **Score:** Killing enemies grants points, picking up the key grants a point, and completing the game grants a point. Getting killed by an enemy loses a point.\n\n**Sprite Behaviors:**\n\n*   `Immovable`: Cannot be moved (e.g., walls, key). `randomtiling` on the floor makes the floor look less uniform.\n*   `ShootAvatar`: Allows the avatar to fire projectiles (swords).\n*   `RandomNPC`: Enemies move randomly with a cooldown (determines how often they move). `cons` likely means the amount of health the enemy has.\n*   `OrientedFlicker`: Makes the sword appear as a slash in the direction the avatar is facing when attacking, and disappears quickly.\n*   `stepBack`: Prevents movement and forces the avatar to step back.\n*   `killSprite`: Destroys the sprite.\n*   `transformTo`: Changes the type of sprite (e.g., `nokey` to `withkey`).\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Represents walls.\n*   `.`: Represents empty space/floor.\n*   `g`: Represents the `goal`.\n*   `k`: Represents the `key`.\n*   `A`: Represents the starting position of the `avatar`.\n*   `1`, `2`, `3`: Represent different types of enemies. It seems `1` is `monsterQuick`, `2` is `monsterNormal`, and `3` is `monsterSlow`.\n*   `+`: Represents a `movable` sprite.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key First:** Immediately prioritize getting the `key`. This will allow you to open the door.\n2.  **Conserve Sword Uses:** Since the sword uses are limited, try to plan your attacks and avoid unnecessary swings. Lure enemies into corridors to take them down one by one.\n3.  **Enemy Prioritization:** Take out the `monsterQuick` enemies first, as they pose the biggest threat due to their speed.\n4.  **Use Walls to Your Advantage:** Walls can be used to create choke points, allowing you to fight enemies one-on-one.\n5.  **Movable Block Usage:** Use the `movable` blocks to create walls.\n6.  **Maximize Score:** If possible, try to kill all enemies for maximum points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterQuick -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> %\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
