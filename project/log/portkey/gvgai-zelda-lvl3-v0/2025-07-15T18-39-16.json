Game Genre and Overall Feel:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a puzzle\u2013action maze game mixed with arcade action. You navigate a level laid out like a grid or maze, avoid or confront roaming enemies, and fulfill a series of steps to win.\n\u2003\u2022 The visual style is retro and sprite\u2010based, with simple tile graphics (walls, floors) and themed icons such as keys, doors, and monsters.\n\n2. Key Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement & Navigation: You control an \u201cavatar\u201d that can move around the level. The level is built of walls and floors, so maneuvering through corridors is required.\n\u2003\u2022 Collecting Objects: One of the central mechanics is picking up a key. When your avatar (initially shown as a \u201cnokey\u201d sprite) touches a key, you transform into a \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite. This transformation likely also gives you some points.\n\u2003\u2022 Using Your Sword: Your avatar has the ability to shoot a sword (the \u201csword\u201d sprite flickers for a limited number of frames). You can use this to kill enemies when you encounter them.\n\u2003\u2022 Interactions With Other Objects:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If you try to go through the door (the \u201cgoal\u201d) while still without the key (nokey), you\u2019re blocked.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Once you have the key (withkey), your contact with the door \u201ckills\u201d (removes) the door sprite and nets you extra points.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Touching an enemy directly as your avatar without using your sword results in a negative score and is dangerous.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When you hit enemies with your sword, you score extra points.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 Objective: The goal is to complete the level by transforming your avatar (by collecting the key) and then reaching the door (goal). \n\u2003\u2022 Winning: The game is won when the goal (door) is \u201ccleared\u201d (removed, triggered by a successful interaction with your withkey form) which signifies completion.\n\u2003\u2022 Losing: You lose if your avatar is destroyed (i.e. when you run into an enemy without proper measures, as indicated by the termination condition based on the avatar sprite being gone).\n\n4. Possible Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 First, survey the maze: Notice where walls, the key, enemies, and the door are located.\n\u2003\u2022 Head for the key: Navigate carefully to collect the key. This is essential because only in the \u201cwithkey\u201d state can you effectively interact with\u2014and clear\u2014the door, which is your win condition.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid or engage enemies wisely: If you come across roaming monsters (which move at different speeds), either avoid them or use your sword attack from a safe distance. Hitting enemies with your sword gets you extra points.\n\u2003\u2022 Take calculated risks: Sometimes getting a better score might tempt you to confront monsters, but remember that simply touching them as your avatar without attacking will hurt you.\n\u2003\u2022 Plan your route: Look for paths that allow you to safely collect the key, and then approach the door with minimal enemy interference.\n\u2003\u2022 Manage your timing against enemy movement: Enemies wander randomly, so waiting for the right moment to advance might be the key to staying safe.\n\nIn summary, your overall strategy should be to carefully explore the maze, get the key to transform your avatar, and then make a beeline for the door while using your sword to neutralize threats. Keep an eye on enemy movements, and always consider whether to avoid them or strike for extra points. This blend of puzzle solving, navigation, and tactical combat is what defines the game and will guide you to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> %\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> m\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> &\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
