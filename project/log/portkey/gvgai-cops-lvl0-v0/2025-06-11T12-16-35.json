Players control an avatar and navigate through a maze-like environment, facing enemies (thugs and a boss) while collecting resources (keys and villains). \n\n**Game Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites and Resources:**\n   - The game consists of various sprites including the player avatar, different types of thugs (red, green, yellow), villains to be captured, walls, jaildoors, and a boss character.\n   - The avatar collects keys to unlock jaildoors and capture villains, which yield different point values.\n   - Thugs can be resources to capture, and success is tied to managing these resources effectively.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Players can step back upon colliding with walls or jaildoors.\n   - Collecting a key allows the player to open jaildoors, but only if they have fewer than the resource limit (1 key).\n   - Capturing each type of thug adds to the player's resources (red, green, yellow villains) while defeating the boss yields a significant score boost.\n\n3. **Scoring and Resources:**\n   - Different villains yield different points upon capture, with the red villain providing the most points (100).\n   - Collecting thugs and managing resources carefully is crucial for a higher score.\n\n**Objective**\nThe main goal is to capture villains (red, green, yellow) by interacting with them in the game level and defeating the boss. Players must also strategically collect keys to navigate through jaildoors and to deny other sprites their resources.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- The player wins by eliminating the boss character, which suggests that defeating all thugs and collecting their resources is a key aspect of reaching this condition.\n- The player loses if a timeout occurs (after 1900 units of time) or if the boss sprite counts still exist at the end of this time limit (indicating the boss was not defeated).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Focus on collecting the key as early as possible, since it\u2019s essential for opening jaildoors and capturing villains.\n   - Be aware of how many resources (thugs/villains) you currently have; avoid having too many of the same type conflicting with resource limits.\n\n2. **Jail and Thug Interactions:**\n   - Prioritize interactions with the 'greenthug', 'yellowthug', and 'redthug' to maximize your resources quickly. Capture them in sequential order, adapting your strategy based on the color threat level (red being the highest).\n   - Utilize jail interactions to respawn the captured resources (villains) wisely; capturing them yields significant score increases.\n\n3. **Positioning and Movement:**\n   - Carefully navigate through the maze layout, avoiding unnecessary encounters with walls.\n   - Keep track of the thug and boss placements to avoid getting cornered. Stepping back and repositioning is key to survival and success.\n\n4. **Timely Defeat of Boss:**\n   - As time runs out, focus efforts on defeating the boss, as this is critical for winning the game and can drastically change your score.\n   - Ensure you have sufficient resources before engaging the boss to make the battle easier.\n\nBy combining strategic resource collection, careful positioning, and timely aggression against tougher opponents, players can navigate the challenges posed by this game and secure victory!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
