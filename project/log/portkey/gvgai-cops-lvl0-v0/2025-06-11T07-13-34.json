Players navigate through a maze-like environment, engaging with enemies and acquiring resources to complete certain objectives.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- You control an avatar (likely a cop, based on the sprite description) that interacts with various immovable and movable elements.\n- Various \"thugs\" and \"villains\" are present, acting as enemies that the player must deal with.\n- The player can collect keys and interact with jail doors that serve as both a barrier and an objective.\n- The game employs resource management mechanics, where the player needs to manage different \"villain\" types as resources.\n- Players gain points by defeating villains and collecting keys, and there are spawning mechanics based on resource levels.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective seems to be to defeat all bosses (thug and villain type sprites) while managing your resources (keys and villain types).\n- Achieving a high score by handling enemies effectively (killing them) and unlocking jail doors is also a key objective.\n- Players must also avoid timeout, which would result in a loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- You win the game if you defeat all bosses (\"SpriteCounter stype=boss limit=0\").\n- You lose the game if time runs out (timeout limit of 1900).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Resource Management:** Collect keys as you navigate through the level, since you have a limit of one. Use these wisely to open jail doors or defeat thugs and villains. Prioritize collecting the key at the depot to create more opportunities for interaction.\n\n2. **Enemy Engagement:** Engage with the thugs carefully. Each has a different color and strategy, which could suggest varied abilities. For instance, securing the red thug might net you a high score. Try to take them down strategically while keeping an eye on your resources.\n\n3. **Use Environment to Your Advantage:** The walls can help you maneuver and block enemies. Don't hesitate to step back rather than confront enemies head-on if you don't have enough health or resources.\n\n4. **Timing is Crucial:** Keep track of the time limit; make efficient moves to avoid being overwhelmed by spawns or the impending timeout. Balance between fighting enemies and advancing through the level should be maintained.\n\n5. **Combat Planning:** Plan your actions before engaging multiple enemies at once. Defeating one type of thug after using the key can maximize your score (e.g., targeting the red thug for a high-value resource).\n\n6. **Prioritize Bosses:** Since bosses yield the highest score, plan your route to engage and eliminate them as soon as possible, but also make sure you have enough resources (like health or keys) to handle them effectively.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their performance, maximize their scores, and ultimately defeat the various bosses to achieve victory before time runs out.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
