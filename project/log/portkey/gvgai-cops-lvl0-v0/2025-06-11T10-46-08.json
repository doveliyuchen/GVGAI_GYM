The presence of multiple enemy types and the need to strategize movements against them suggests a blend of exploration and combat.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various immovable objects (walls, floors, jail), interactable objects (keys, depots), and enemies (thugs, villains, a boss).\n- **Avatar:** The player controls an avatar that can move, interact with objects, collect resources, and face off against enemies.\n- **Resources:** Players collect keys to access certain areas and defeat villains corresponding to color-coded thugs for resource management and score.\n- **Enemies:** Different types of enemies (thugs and a boss) with specific interactions. Some can be killed to collect resources, while some require specific circumstances (like collecting resources first) you need to navigate.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary objective is to defeat all instances of the 'boss' sprite before the time limit (1900 units) expires.\n- Players need to collect keys to progress through the jail doors and defeat the different colored thugs to collect their corresponding resources.\n  \n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win: All instances of the boss are defeated.\n- Loss: Timeout occurs before defeating the bosses (if time runs out).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize key collection. The key is essential for progressing through doors and is limited to one.\n   - Keep track of the number of villains you have captured as they significantly affect your score. Each is tied to specific thugs.\n\n2. **Avoiding Enemies:**\n   - Some thugs (like 'thug', 'redthug', 'greenthug', 'yellowthug') seem to provide resources but have to be managed carefully. It's better to pick them off one by one rather than letting them swarm you.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Survey the level layout ahead of time. Notice where enemies spawn and where the depots are located.\n   - Champion the paths that enable you to loop around enemies to minimize confrontation.\n\n4. **Utilize the Jail:**\n   - The jail area seems pivotal as it can spawn resources via the specific interactions. Focus on getting there once you've captured the needed colored villains and have access to resources.\n   - Use the jail strategically to spawn colored thugs that can be converted into points.\n\n5. **Timing:**\n   - Monitor the in-game timer regularly. If you fall behind on your objectives, prioritize boss encounters and aim to capture the villains quickly.\n\n6. **Combat:**\n   - Engage with the thugs cautiously. Use the walls to block off thugs or redirect them away, so they don\u2019t form a cluster.\n   - Plan your engagements with the boss carefully as defeating the boss is essential for completing the game.\n\nBy focusing on resource collection, avoiding unnecessary enemy confrontations, and being strategic with movement and timing, players can effectively navigate the challenges the game presents and work toward victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

    "content": "Since the avatar is currently at (2, 11) and has not moved from that position, I need to consider an action that will allow my avatar to get to an area that could yield keys or defeat thugs. \n\nLooking at the map around the avatar at (2, 11), it appears that the position beneath it at (3, 11) is a wall (b). Moving left (to (2, 10)), right (to (2, 12)), or going up (to (1, 11)) would not change the position either.\n\nHowever, moving down to (3, 11) also reflects a wall (b), so these options would not result in moving to a useful space.\n\nThere's a potential resource position that could be accessed by moving down (3, 7) or any other position. \n\nGiven its stationary status, I will attempt to move left first to check if it results in a better position. I will take the action to move left, as there might be a shift that allows me to then evaluate the next position.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should help navigate the avatar through the layout and gather information from potential resources accessible to the left channels that could yield further beneficial movements.",
