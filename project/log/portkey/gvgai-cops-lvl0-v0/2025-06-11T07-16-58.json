The game includes dynamic interactions between various sprites (characters or objects) and spaces on the map, which makes it feel like a mix of puzzle-solving and combat.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different types of sprites (like thug, villain, jaildoor, and avatar) represent characters, obstacles, and resources.\n- **Movement**: The 'avatar' can move around and interact with other sprites. Movement may include backtracking when encountering walls or specific characters.\n- **Resource Management**: \n  - Keys and villains are resources that the player collects and uses to accomplish objectives.\n  - The avatar can collect keys and manage the number of each type of villain captured.\n- **Scoring System**: The avatar earns scores based on resources collected or foes defeated.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to defeat the boss sprite while collecting resource points from red, green, and yellow villains. The game's win condition is to ensure that the boss is defeated before the timer runs out.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by eliminating the boss sprite (as indicated by the sprite counter reaching zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the timer runs out (at 1900 ticks).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Collection**: Start by collecting the key immediately as it is crucial for opening the jaildoor and managing your resources effectively. Prioritize collecting villains for score points.\n\n2. **Efficiency in Movement**: Be cautious of walls and thugs. Use strategic movement to avoid any unwanted interactions that can disrupt your plans, such as having to step back.\n\n3. **Managing Interactions**:\n   - Engage with various thugs (red, green, yellow) to capture their corresponding villain resources.\n   - Use resources efficiently, as each type of villain gives different score points (red gives 100 points).\n\n4. **Jail and Transitions**:\n   - Utilize the jail effectively to spawn transitions for delivering captured villains, which directly impacts score points.\n   - The layout suggests that certain paths lead to better collection cycles \u2014 explore these wisely.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the remaining time. Plan your moves to ensure that you defeat the boss before the time runs out. Remember to move quickly between collection points and the jail.\n\n6. **Final Preparation for Boss Fight**:\n   - Ensure you have gathered sufficient villain resources to maximize your score upon defeating the boss.\n   - Position yourself strategically before engaging the boss to minimize potential damage.\n\nBy focusing on efficiency, resource management, and critical path navigation, you'll maximize your chances of achieving a high score and defeating the boss sprite in this engaging action-adventure game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
