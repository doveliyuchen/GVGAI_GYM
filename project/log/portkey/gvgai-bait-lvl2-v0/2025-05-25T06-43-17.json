    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle** or **platformer** genre. The presence of sprites representing keys, doors, obstacles, and interactive elements suggests a focus on solving spatial challenges and navigating through levels with specific objectives.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** There are various sprites with specific roles:\n  - **Avatar (player character)** can move and interact with other sprites.\n  - **Key and Goal:** The goal is to collect a key to unlock a door (goal) and progress through the level.\n  - **Boxes:** The player can interact with boxes, potentially using them to manipulate the environment or access new areas.\n  - **Hazards:** Holes and mushrooms kill the avatar upon contact, creating obstacles to avoid.\n  \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can only progress towards the goal if it has transformed into the \"withkey\" state by collecting the key sprite.\n  - Certain interactions (like falling into a hole or touching mushrooms) result in losing the game or penalties, encouraging players to navigate carefully.\n  \n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect a key by interacting with it, then use that key to unlock the door (goal) at the end of the level. Successfully navigating obstacles and avoiding death will be crucial to achieve this.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when there are no remaining goal sprites (which means the door has been opened successfully).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's sprite limit reaches zero (the avatar dies), indicating they have lost all their lives or hit a hazard.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Careful Navigation:** Move slowly and cautiously to avoid hazards like holes and mushrooms. Pay attention to the surrounding environment to plan your path.\n  \n2. **Use the Boxes:** Utilize the boxes effectively to bounce off or manipulate them to reach different areas. Use the boxes to avoid holes by creating safe paths.\n\n3. **Collect the Key Early:** Prioritize reaching the key when you identify its position to transform your avatar into the \"withkey\" state.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards:** Be aware of the locations of hazards, and plan to maneuver around them while keeping your end goal in sight.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves:** Since the walls and other obstacles can block your path, strategize your moves to ensure you can make your way to the key and ultimately the goal without getting stuck.\n\n6. **Keep an Eye on Lives:** Since the loss of the avatar results in game over, be mindful of your moves to prevent unnecessary deaths.\n\n7. **Experiment:** If you encounter situations that seem unclear, like the interaction between boxes, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment. Sometimes trial and error can yield new insights into the optimal way to proceed.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of success in this puzzle-adventure game while engaging with its mechanics effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To determine an appropriate action based on the current game state, let\u2019s analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is currently in a space that has a specific interaction based on the layout of the map. We will need to identify the avatar's location in terms of rows and columns. There seems to be multiple '@' representing boxes but no explicit location for the avatar, as it's not shown in the current map information.\n\n2. **Objective**: The primary goal is to collect the key (`%`) and reach the goal (`#`). Upon examining the map, the key is located at (2, 6) and the goal is at (8, 7).\n\n3. **Surroundings**: The avatar might be positioned around multiple boxes, holes, and walls. We need to carefully consider the surroundings, especially hazards like holes (`$`) located in various places on the map.\n\nGiven that there is no specific position of the avatar stated, we'll need a default action to reorient our avatar strategically or make sure we can still interact with the environment effectively. \n\n### Decision\nSince the initial movement wasn't indicated (meaning the avatar location isn\u2019t defined clearly), I will choose **ACTION_NIL (0)** as my action this turn. This will allow us to determine if the avatar needs to rotate or uncover further options based on its current orientation.\n\n``` Action:0 ```\nI will observe the outcome of this action to clarify if the avatar needs to adjust its current direction or if I should proceed with a different action next turn based on its positional clarity.",
