    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. The mechanics involve navigating levels, solving puzzles, and interacting with various sprite types to achieve a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various types of sprites that serve different purposes:\n   - **Avatar**: The player character, which can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Keys**: Items that transform the avatar into a version with access to goals.\n   - **Goals**: Exit points that require the avatar to be in a specific state (like having a key) to access.\n   - **Obstacles**: Such as holes and walls which can either kill the avatar or restrict movement.\n   - **Mushrooms**: They negate the avatar with an associated score penalty.\n   - **Boxes**: Can be used to interact with other objects in their environment, leading to bouncing and death interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar interacts with walls by stepping back, indicating movement restrictions.\n   - Falling into holes results in the avatar's death.\n   - Boxes bounce the avatar, affecting movement.\n   - Collecting keys transforms the avatar, allowing it to interact with goals.\n   - Goals must be accessed using the transformed avatar for successful level completion.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all goal sprites (i.e., reach them with the transformed avatar with the key) while ensuring the avatar is not killed through various interactions found in the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Achieve 0 goal sprites remaining in the level, indicated by SpriteCounter for goals reaching 0.\n- **Loss Condition**: Avatar limit reaching 0, represented when the avatar character dies from falling into holes or other interactions.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Level**: Start by moving around to gather the layout and identify where keys and goals are located.\n2. **Collect Keys**: Ensure you interact with keys whenever possible to increase the chances of accessing the goal. Avoid holes or any obstacles during this process.\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Position boxes to create routes or to bounce into positions without risking falling into holes. \n4. **Avoid Mushrooms**: Always steer clear of mushrooms to prevent unnecessary score penalties and avatar deaths.\n5. **Plan Movements**: Make strategic moves and calculate interactions to avoid getting trapped or killed.\n6. **Transform and Proceed**: Once you gather a key, use it to obtain the proper key-carrying avatar state and head towards the goal.\n\nFollowing these strategies should lead to efficient level navigation and a higher chance of completing the objectives effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",

In the provided map, the avatar has not been explicitly mentioned, suggesting it might not be currently in a defined position. \n\nBased on the overview of the level, the following features stand out:\n- There are various blocks (represented as '.', '$', '&', etc.) and specific items such as keys and goals.\n- The goal represented by `#` exists at an accessible location, but the avatar's current position has not yet been established.\n\nSince the avatar position is a crucial piece of information and it's not clear from the current representation, I need to take a no-operation action at this moment to gather any further layout or position updates. \n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n``` Action:0 ```\nThis will allow me to confirm if there have been any updates regarding the avatar's position so I can continue formulating a strategy effectively.",
