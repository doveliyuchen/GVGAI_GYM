Can transform into one that possesses a key, and one that doesn't\n*   **Floor:** Empty space.\n*   **Hole:** A pit; the avatar falls in and dies if they step into it. Boxes pushed into it grant score\n*   **Key:** Collectible item that transforms the avatar.\n*   **Goal:** The exit/target. Needs a key to be opened and removed, granting a score.\n*   **Box:** Pushable object. Core mechanic revolves around manipulating these.\n*   **Wall:** Impassable barrier.\n*   **Mushroom:** When a box hits a mushroom surrounded by walls and boxes, undoes the level\n*   **Sprite with key (withkey):** The avatar's representation of when in possession of a key\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** Avatar moves.\n*   **Pushing:** Avatar pushes boxes. Boxes cannot be pulled.\n*   **Transformation:** The Avatar can transform into a 'withkey' sprite by collecting keys.\n*   **Death/Restart:** Falling into a hole kills the avatar, leading to a loss.\n*   **Level Reset:** Triggered by specific box placement near mushrooms.\n\n**Win Condition:** The `SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True` line means you win when there are no more 'goal' sprites left on the screen. You need to open and remove all doors to win.\n\n**Loss Condition:** The `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False` line means you lose if there are no 'avatar' sprites left on the screen, i.e. the avatar falls into a hole and dies.\n\n**Interactions:**\n\n*   Avatar cannot walk through walls\n*   Avatar dies upon falling into a hole.\n*   Avatar bounces back when it runs into a box.\n*   Boxes can be pushed.\n*   Boxes in holes are killed, granting a score.\n*   The Avatar transforms when it picks up the key.\n*   Avatar cannot open a door without a key\n*   Goal is killed when it interacts with a 'withkey' avatar.\n*   Avatar earns points when interacting with mushroom.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w` = Wall\n*   `.` = Floor\n*   `A` = Avatar start\n*   `g` = Goal\n*   `k` = Key\n*   `m` = mushroom\n*   `1` = Box\n*   `0` = Hole\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Key Collection:** Prioritize getting the key early. This is essential to open the goals.\n2.  **Box Management:** Think carefully about box placement. Avoid cornering yourself or blocking access to keys/goals. Remember the undo mechanic with the mushrooms, walls, and boxes\n3.  **Hole Awareness:** Be extremely cautious near holes. One wrong push can be fatal.\n4.  **Goal Clearing:** Once you have the key, focus on opening and removing goals, earning the required score for clearing the level.\n\nIn essence, this game is about careful planning and spatial reasoning. You need to plan your moves to collect keys, push boxes strategically to reach and clear the goals without falling into holes or blocking your path.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",
