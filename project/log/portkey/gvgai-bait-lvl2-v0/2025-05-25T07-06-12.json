The goal gives points upon completion.\n   - **Mushrooms and Boxes**: Passive elements with interactions that affect the avatar's movement and score.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts differently with appliances (walls, holes, mushrooms) compared to collectible items (key, goal). \n   - Collecting a key transforms the avatar. Only the transformed avatar (now with a key) can access the goal.\n   - Interacting with holes or certain sprites can result in the loss of the avatar or score alterations.\n\n#### Objective\nThe player's main objective is to reach the goal sprite, which is located at the end of the level, while managing the key collection and survival against hazards such as holes and mushrooms. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All goal sprites are collected (i.e., the goal is reached without the avatar dying).\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar is eliminated (i.e., the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning the Route**: Before starting, scan the level layout to plan a path that avoids holes and mushrooms. Pay attention to walls that block direct pathways.\n\n2. **Key Collection**: Focus on collecting the key as soon as it's feasible. Avoid the mushroom that can cause score loss directly after collecting the key, if possible.\n\n3. **Managing Interactions**: Use boxes wisely to bounce forward while also avoiding interactions with walls that would cause a step back. \n\n4. **Avoiding Hazards**: Be cautious near holes and mushrooms, as interacting with them will lead to instant loss or score deduction. Keep a safe distance.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Aim to collect keys and reach the goal efficiently to maximize scoring. Avoid unnecessary interactions unless they provide greater benefit.\n\n6. **Practice Movement**: Since movement is key, practice shifting around the walls and utilizing boxes effectively to navigate the level while reducing the chance of hitting hazards.\n\n7. **Explore Different Strategies**: If stuck, consider different routes through the level and revisit the sprite interactions to devise the best approach for reaching the goal.\n\nBy employing these strategies, the player can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the level, collecting the necessary keys, avoiding hazards, and ultimately winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",
