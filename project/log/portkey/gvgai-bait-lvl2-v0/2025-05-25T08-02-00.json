    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to be a puzzle platformer. Players control an avatar navigating through a grid-based layout, solving puzzles to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Interaction:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character which can move around the map and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Walls and Floor:** These are immovable obstacles that the avatar cannot pass through. Interacting with them causes limited movement (e.g., step back).\n   - **Holes:** Represent hazards that cause the avatar to be 'killed' if they fall into them.\n   - **Boxes:** Can be used to bounce off the avatar and can interact with other objects.\n   - **Keys and Goals:** \n     - **Key (nokey and withkey):** Collecting a key transforms the avatar into a version that can open the goal. \n     - **Goal:** Represents a target destination that grants score and victory upon being reached with a key.\n\n2. **Score System:**\n   - Players gain points by interacting with specific items (e.g., killing a sprite like a mushroom or falling into a hole with a box).\n\n### Objectives:\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the 'goal' sprite after collecting the key. The player needs to navigate the maze-like structure, avoiding hazards and managing interactions with various sprites to ultimately get to the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n1. **Win Condition:** \n   - The game is won if the player reaches the goal sprite (with the key) and there are no remaining goals (SpriteCounter limit is 0).\n   \n2. **Loss Condition:**\n   - The game is lost if the avatar (player character) is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit for avatar is 0).\n\n### Level Layout Overview:\n- The level is surrounded by walls (labeled as 'w') and contains spaces for movement (denoted as '.'). There are configured sprites in specific patterns (like '0' for boxes, '1' for keys, 'A' for the avatar, and 'm' for the mushroom).\n- The layout appears intricate, demanding careful navigation due to the holes, walls, and other sprites like mushrooms.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Exploration:** Start by carefully exploring the area to understand the layout of walls, holes, and the locations of keys and goals.\n\n2. **Key Collection:** Prioritize collecting the key (located at coordinate representations like '1') as it is necessary for opening the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Be cautious around holes and mushrooms. The avatar can get 'killed' by falling into a hole or interacting with a mushroom, leading to a loss.\n\n4. **Bounce and Manipulate Boxes:** Use boxes strategically. They can be used to bounce the avatar into correct positions, or even unintentionally eliminate hazards if they land in a hole.\n\n5. **Path to Goal:** Once the key is obtained, focus on finding the path to the goal without falling into hazards. Move systematically to avoid stepping back unnecessarily.\n\n6. **Backup Plan:** Always have backup movements in mind (e.g., if stepping back causes a loss of progress, consider alternative routes). \n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through the game efficiently, avoid losses, and maximize their chances of success by reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar ('*') is located at (7, 6). The immediate environment includes walls surrounding the area with a key located at (2, 6), a goal ('#') at (8, 7), and a mushroom ('&') at (4, 6).\n\nFrom the analysis of the level layout, potential strategies involve navigating towards the key so that you can eventually reach the goal. However, you are currently stuck in a situation where moving left or right will not yield movement due to walls directly blocking those paths. Instead, you can only potentially move down.\n\nHere's the summary of the surroundings:\n- Down (8, 6): Open space (.)\n- Up (6, 6): Box (@), might be able to interact with\n- Left (7, 5): Wall (b)\n- Right (7, 7): Wall (b)\n\nThe only immediate action that makes sense would be moving down (8, 6) to create new opportunities for exploration towards the key and the goal.\n\nIt is important to make moves that advance you towards your objective. \n\nTherefore, the most logical action is:  \n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action moves your avatar down into an open space, allowing further exploration and movement options in the next turn.",
