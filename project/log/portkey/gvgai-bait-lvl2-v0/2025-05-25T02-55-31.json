    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer, where the player navigates through a level filled with various obstacles, using mechanics related to collecting items and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game contains various sprites such as walls, holes, mushrooms, keys, and a goal. Players control an avatar that can move and interact with these sprites.\n2. **Avatar**: The player\u2019s character can move, encounter walls, collect keys, and interact with other objects (like boxes and mushrooms).\n3. **Key Mechanic**: The player starts as a 'nokey' avatar and can transform into a 'withkey' avatar after collecting a key. This signifies a progression mechanic essential to reaching the goal.\n4. **Box Interaction**: The avatar can push boxes; there is also a mechanic where boxes interact with walls and mushrooms to either undo actions or cause the player to bounce forward.\n5. **Scoring**: Certain interactions (like the mushroom and the hole) result in a score change (gaining or losing points).\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal (represented by a door) while navigating through hazards and collecting keys to enable the avatar to unlock the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no more 'goal' sprites remaining on the screen (i.e., the player reaches the goal with the key).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the player\u2019s avatar (the moving character) reaches a limit of zero (i.e., dies in a hole or any undesired interaction).\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify the locations of keys, goals, and hazards (like holes).\n2. **Collect Keys**: Your priority should be to collect keys as quickly as possible. This will allow you to transform from 'nokey' to 'withkey', enabling access to the goal.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious around holes and mushrooms that can kill your avatar. Plan your moves to dodge these hazards carefully.\n4. **Utilize Boxes**: Use boxes to both navigate and solve puzzles. Leveraging the interaction between boxes and walls may provide pathways or new opportunities.\n5. **Testing Interactions**: Experiment with different interactions, especially with boxes and walls, to see how the mechanics can work in your favor. For example, see how bouncing from boxes can help maneuver around obstacles.\n6. **Minimize Deaths**: Always have multiple paths to retreat if faced with a dangerous situation \u2013 this will help prevent instant losses by falling into a hole or getting killed by a mushroom.\n\nBy understanding these core elements and strategically approaching the level, you can enhance your chances of success in completing the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "In the current game state, my avatar (represented by '*') is located at (row=7, col=6). I need to strategize my next move to progress toward the goal (represented by '#') located at (row=8, col=7).\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. The avatar is on a nokey floor, meaning I have to find a key to progress.\n2. The nearest key (represented by '%') is located at (row=2, col=6).\n3. There are holes (represented by '$') and mushrooms (represented by '&') in the environment that I need to avoid.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nI cannot move left or right due to walls on either side (moving left or right would lead to walls). The options I have are:\n- Up (to row=6, col=6): This will keep my position on another box floor ('@').\n- Down (to row=8, col=6): This is a safe move but wouldn't progress towards my primary objective of collecting a key.\n  \nSince the primary task is to collect keys to proceed further, I should consider moving up to row 6, col 6, which may allow me to strategize for collecting the key effectively in the next move.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves my avatar UP to (row=6, col=6) which is positioned on the box floor '@'. I will then reassess the next move from this new position, ideally allowing me to plan for progressing towards collecting the key afterwards.",
