The avatar interacts with different objects in specific ways:\n  - Colliding with walls causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Falling into holes results in the avatar\u2019s death (game over).\n  - Interacting with boxes causes them to bounce the avatar forward.\n  - The avatar can collect keys to transform its type, gaining the ability to interact with the goal sprite.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to reach the goal (a door) while avoiding deaths from falling into holes or being killed by mushrooms. The player must collect the key to successfully interact with the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win:** The player wins if the goal is reached while holding the key, indicated by the goal sprite's transformation and a score increase.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the avatar runs out of lives (indicated by having no avatars left), or if the avatar falls into a hole or is killed by a mushroom.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards:** Always be mindful of holes and mushrooms. Plan your movements to navigate around them safely.\n\n2. **Collect Keys:** Prioritize collecting the key as soon as possible. The avatar transforms to 'withkey' when it interacts with the key, allowing it to reach the goal.\n\n3. **Use Boxes to Your Advantage:** Make use of the boxes for bouncing forward, especially to maintain distance from hazards or gain access to higher platforms.\n\n4. **Plan Your Moves:** Think ahead about interactions before you move. For instance, understand how moving a box into a wall or mushroom will affect your position or available resources.\n\n5. **Watch Your Positioning:** Always position the avatar so that it doesn\u2019t accidentally fall into a hole, especially after bouncing off a box.\n\n6. **Explore the Level:** Take time to explore the level\u2019s layout; some paths may lead to secrets or additional supports that can aid in safely reaching the goal.\n\n7. **Optimize Score:** If possible, aim to complete levels while maximizing your score through careful interactions, such as bouncing boxes into holes to gain points.\n\nThis understanding of mechanics, objectives, and best practices will not only help you navigate through the current level but also prepare you for potentially more complex levels in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To determine a meaningful action for the avatar based on the current game state, let's first identify the avatar's position and assess the surrounding sprites.\n\n### Avatar's position:\nIn the provided map, the player avatar is located at:\n- Row: 6, Column: 6 (represented as '@')\n\n### Relevant Surroundings:\n- Up (Row 5, Col 6): another box ('@')\n- Down (Row 7, Col 6): empty space ('.')\n- Left (Row 6, Col 5): empty space ('.')\n- Right (Row 6, Col 7): empty space ('.')\n\n### Objective Analysis:\nThe main goal is to reach the goal sprite ('#') at (8, 7) while avoiding hazards and collecting the key ('%') at (2, 6). The current objective after assessing the surroundings is to potentially move closer to the goal.\n\n### Actions and Strategy:\nSince the avatar is capable of bouncing off boxes, moving down (to (7, 6)) opens up further options such as exploring more of the level and potentially moving towards the goal.\n\nGiven there are no immediate hazards in the down direction and that it leads toward a more open area, I will choose to move down.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow exploration to open up toward the lower part of the map, leading to potential pathways toward the goal. Keeping the strategy in mind, I expect this movement to provide more options for further positioning in subsequent turns.",
