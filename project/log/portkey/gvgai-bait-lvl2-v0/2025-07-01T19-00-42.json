The inclusion of various interactable sprites suggests that players will need to solve problems and navigate through a platforming environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game features a variety of sprites such as walls, boxes, keys, avatars, mushrooms, goals, and holes. Each has a specific role and interacts with the avatar and each other in defined ways.\n   - The avatar (the player-controlled character) can move around, interact with different elements, and undergo transformational states (from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls.\n   - Falling into holes results in losing the avatar (game over).\n   - The avatar can bounce boxes and interact with them to achieve specific results, like transforming or collecting items.\n   - Collecting a key transforms the avatar and allows it to access goals; without a key, the avatar cannot win.\n   - Touching mushrooms results in a negative outcome, whereas touching the goal with the key results in a win.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while transforming the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey' by obtaining the key, while also navigating around hazards (holes and mushrooms) and strategically using boxes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite with the key (transforming to 'withkey').\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is lost (either through falling into a hole or the avatar count reaching zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout to identify where the key, mushrooms, and goal are relative to each other.\n\n2. **Box Usage:**\n   - Use boxes strategically to navigate around walls and create pathways. To reach the key and goal, efficiently bouncing boxes could help you traverse obstacles.\n\n3. **Caution with Hazards:**\n   - Avoid mushrooms as they will result in losing points and potentially lead to a loss condition if the avatar is lost.\n   - Be mindful of holes in the map to avoid instant defeat.\n\n4. **Key Collection:**\n   - Prioritize reaching the key as it is essential for completing the level. Once the avatar transforms into 'withkey', you can directly aim for the goal.\n\n5. **Movement Strategy:**\n   - Use the limited movements of the avatar wisely to ensure you don\u2019t get trapped, especially when manipulating boxes to navigate. Being cautious around walls and timing your interactions will help maintain avatar safety.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game's challenges and reach the goal, ultimately achieving a win!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> b\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> b\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b",
