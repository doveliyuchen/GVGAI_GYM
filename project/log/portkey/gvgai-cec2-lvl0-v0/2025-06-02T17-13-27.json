The game likely incorporates elements of strategy, logic, and possibly time management, as suggested by the interactions and the timer mechanics.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - The game features various sprites including walls, lights, and the player avatar (represented by a necromancer). There are also interactive objects like \"nook\" and \"ok\" which serve specific functions.\n   \n2. **Interactions:** \n   - Players can interact with objects in the environment, primarily using a staff. Different interactions can modify the state of lights and sprites, enabling tasks and altering the environment (e.g., turning lights on/off, moving to different states).\n   - The avatar seems to have a primary interaction that can change the state of sprites over time, indicating a mechanic based on maintaining certain conditions or states.\n\n3. **Timers:**\n   - There is a TIME interaction that triggers changes repeatedly, suggesting there is an aspect of time-based strategy where players must act quickly to achieve objectives.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe objective of the game is likely to reach a win condition defined by:\n- Turning all \"nook\" sprites into \"ok\" sprites, as indicated by the winning condition where the dual sprite counter needs to hit zero for the win.\n- Players must also manage their timing efficiently; failing the timeout condition results in a loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won by transforming all \"nook\" sprites into \"ok\" sprites (achieved by reaching a state where the MultiSpriteCounter for \"nook\" and \"to_ok\" is zero).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the player runs out of time (timeout limit is set to 1000).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Analyze the layout carefully before starting to move. Plan a route that allows you to interact with as many relevant sprites as possible in a sequence to maximize efficiency.\n\n2. **Manage Your Time:**\n   - Pay close attention to the timers when triggering state changes. Create a system or pattern that allows you to reset and check the states of lights and sprites while being aware of the remaining time.\n\n3. **Transformations:**\n   - Keep track of the transformations of sprites. Each light state has specific interactions with your staff. Utilize the \"lighton\" and \"lightoff\" states strategically based on the layout to facilitate transitions to \"nook\" and \"ok\".\n\n4. **Use Walls to Your Advantage:**\n   - The walls serve as immovable objects. Make sure to navigate around them carefully and use them to \u201cstep back\u201d if you need to avoid a situation that could lead to timeout.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Experiment with different sequences of interactions, as you may need to try various combinations of light states and sprite transformations to find the optimal path.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics, objectives, and strategically planning your moves, you can work towards completing the game efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I see that my avatar (the necromancer) is located at (row=5, col=4). There are several lighton floors (indicated by '#') around me, and several 'ok' sprites (indicated by '@') that are currently positioned on the map. \n\n### Situation Analysis\n- I can interact with the avatar's staff located directly to my right at (5, 5).\n- There are many walls ('$') surrounding my current position, limiting movement options.\n- The immediate goal is to transform 'nook' sprites (represented by 'b' and 'c') into 'ok' sprites (represented by 'd').\n\n### Strategy Considerations\nGiven that I am next to the staff, it might be beneficial to interact with it first since it allows me to activate nearby lights. This can aid in transforming any 'nook' (if present in the area) into 'ok', as well as manage the light states effectively.\n\n### Action Decision\nI will use the staff to see if I can trigger something beneficial, even though my current position is somewhat limited.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is expected to enhance my strategy by possibly influencing the light states in my surroundings, making it easier to approach the 'nook' sprites afterward.",
