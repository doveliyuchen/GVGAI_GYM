    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules, the game appears to fit into the **puzzle genre** with a focus on strategy and resource management. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the game's mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\n- **Puzzle Game**: The player must solve spatial and logical challenges using specific mechanics involving \"sprites\" and transformations.\n\n### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: Various elements like 'floor', 'walls', 'lights', and 'avatar' represent different objects in the game world.\n  - **Immovable object**: 'floor', 'wall', 'ok', 'nook', and 'transits' cannot be moved.\n  - **Passive object**: 'lightoff' and 'lighton' change states based on interaction with the 'staff'.\n  - **Dynamic object**: The 'avatar' manipulates other sprites.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can interact with walls to step back, and the staff can transform other sprites between different states, which is key to solving the puzzles.\n- **Timer**: The avatar can cycle through different states (to_off, to_on, to_ok, to_nook) repeatedly, which suggests time management is a crucial aspect of gameplay.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The player\u2019s goal is to convert the sprite 'nook' (represented by 'a's in the level layout) to 'to_ok' using the 'avatar' and 'staff'. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all instances of 'nook' are transformed into 'to_ok' (the MultiSpriteCounter reaches a limit of 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the timer reaches its limit of 1000 units without achieving the goal.\n\n### Level Layout:\n- The provided grid shows a maze-like structure with walls on the borders and various paths.\n- 'A' denotes the avatar's starting position, while '1's and '0's appear to represent states of the sprites that can also interact with the avatar.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Study the level layout and potential pathways to reach all 'nook' sprites efficiently. Avoid getting trapped by walls or missing transform opportunities.\n2. **Manage the Timer**: Track the time spent on each action. Use the repeated transformations strategically to ensure all 'nook' sprites are converted before the timer runs out.\n3. **Use the Staff Effectively**: Make sure to switch between 'lightoff' and 'lighton' as needed to activate the transforming states. Understand which sprites can interact with each state effectively.\n4. **Convert One by One**: Focus first on nearby 'nook' sprites before moving to distant ones. This staged approach reduces the risk of exhausting the timer too soon.\n5. **Learn from Failures**: If you run out of time in your first attempts, analyze where delays occurred. Streamline actions for subsequent runs.\n\nOverall, the emphasis should be on careful interaction management and strategic movement through the maze to achieve the transformation goals within the timer's constraints.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

    "content": "To begin, I need to analyze the current state of the game. My avatar is currently at position (4, 3) in the grid, represented by 'a'. I observe the surrounding sprites and potential interactions:\n\n- The adjacent cells are:\n  - (4, 2): '.'\n  - (4, 4): '@'\n  \n- The '@' represents a 'lightoff nook floor'. I cannot move to the wall at (4, 0) through (4, 2) since it is only floor space. \n\nLooking at the mechanics, I can utilize the staff to interact with the current sprites, especially since transforming 'nook' to 'ok' is my objective. However, there are no nearby 'nook' sprites ('b') to convert at this immediate moment.\n\nGiven these points, a strategic action is to first ensure I can explore and utilize the 'light' statuses effectively by moving to either side or up/down the maze.\n\n### Next Action:\nI will move **right** to (4, 4) to see if this light interactions can help.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move my avatar to a new position and potentially allow me to interact effectively with the sprite in that area. I expect that by moving towards the staff or changing the light state, I can work towards converting the 'nook' items in later moves.",
