The presence of interactions and transformations suggests a focus on problem-solving and timing.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Objects:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include walls and the floor, which form the boundaries and structure of the game level.\n   - **Light Mechanism:** There are sprites that represent light states (on and off), indicating a toggle or condition-based mechanic.\n   - **Avatar Controls:** The player controls an avatar that can interact with various sprites through a staff, implying a magical or fantasy element.\n   - **Transformations:** The avatar can transform the state of several sprites with the staff, suggesting a dynamic environment that changes based on player actions.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls and other sprites to create different states (like turning lights on and off).\n   - Using the staff, the avatar can manipulate the environment, which suggests the need for strategic choices based on the conditions of the play area.\n\n3. **Time Management:**\n   - The avatar has a time-based interaction component, impacting how and when transformations occur, which adds a level of urgency or planning to the gameplay.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective appears to be achieving a win condition by transforming specific sprites from 'nook' to 'ok'. To win, there must be no instances remaining of 'nook' after transforming them into 'ok'. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** Achieve zero instances of 'nook' transformed to 'ok'.\n- **Lose:** Failing to achieve victory within 1000 time units results in a loss.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Since the game involves turn-based or timed actions, players should map out their moves before executing them. Identify how many moves it takes to transform 'nook' to 'ok' and how to manipulate the light states effectively.\n  \n2. **Manage Time Wisely:** Keep an eye on the timer and optimize actions to ensure that transformations occur before the time limit.\n\n3. **Toggle Light States Strategically:** Use the staff to switch lights on and off at appropriate times to manipulate the 'lighton' and 'lightoff' states without wasting turns.\n\n4. **Avoid Walls:** The avatar will step back when interacting with walls, so avoid unnecessary movements that could delay your progress.\n\n5. **Focus on Key Areas:** Concentrate efforts on sections of the level where multiple transformations can occur, as this can compound your progress towards the objective.\n\nBy considering these strategies and understanding the mechanics, players can devise a plan to navigate the puzzle efficiently and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

    "content": "To achieve the win condition, the primary goal is to transform all instances of 'nook' (represented by 'b' and 'c') into 'ok' (represented by 'd') while ensuring that no 'nook' remains in the level after the transformations. \n\nThe current position of the avatar is at (row=6, col=4) where 'a' is located, but there are no interactive sprites directly around it. The nearby interactions will need some planning as the avatar has to move towards light states or 'nook' sprites to utilize the staff effectively.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis:\n1. **Surrounding Area**: The avatar at (6,4) is surrounded mostly by empty spaces ('.'), with walls ('$') on the boundaries. To make meaningful moves, the avatar needs to find a 'nook' or a light state.\n2. **Available Transformation**: Based on the game rules, the avatar needs to reach the 'nook' sprites to toggle them to 'ok.'\n3. **Immediate Actions**: The closest 'nook' is below the avatar at (5,3) where '@' is present, but the avatar cannot move to it directly due to needing an interaction first.\n\n### Planned Action:\nTo assess the surroundings and locate any actions, the best immediate action is to **move left** (to (6,3)), as it may allow further movement options thereafter.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis directional action should advance towards potentially interactable areas, and I expect it to help position the avatar more strategically in the next turn for either transformation or further movement.",
