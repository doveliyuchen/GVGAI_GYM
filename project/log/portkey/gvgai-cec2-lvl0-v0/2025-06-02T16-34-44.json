The interactions require players to manipulate various game elements to achieve specific tasks and overcome challenges.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game consists of various types of sprites (objects) including immovable walls (`wall`), a player avatar (`avatar`), and different states of lights (`lighton`, `lightoff`).\n   - The `staff` serves as a tool that interacts with other sprites to change their states.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, leading to a \"step back\" behavior and cannot pass through them.\n   - The avatar can change the state of the `staff` by interacting with light sources and specific sprites (`ok`, `nook`).\n   - A timer-based mechanic appears to be in place, managing how long certain states remain active.\n\n3. **Level Layout:**\n   - The level design consists of walls (`w`), floors (`.`), and specific areas labeled with letters and numbers (`A`, `a`, `c`, `0`, `1`), which likely represent different trigger points, objectives, or collectibles.\n   - The arrangement suggests areas where light may need to be toggled on or off in a specific order to solve the puzzle.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe player must manipulate the state of sprites to activate specific conditions necessary to win the game, notably interacting with `nook` and progressing to `ok` through the `staff`.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The goal is achieved when the player successfully transforms all instances of the `nook` sprite into `to_ok` sprites, which meet the limit condition of the `MultiSpriteCounter`.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if a timeout occurs after a specified limit of 1000 ticks or actions, suggesting an urgency to complete the tasks within a certain timeframe.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Planning Your Moves:**\n   - Begin by exploring the layout of the level and identifying where the walls and interactable sprites are located.\n   - Take note of the positions of pairs of `nook` to `ok` transitions and the corresponding states that need to be activated.\n\n2. **Using the Staff Effectively:**\n   - Use the `staff` wisely to change the state of the light (`lighton`/`lightoff`) where necessary. Activating the correct light at the correct moment seems critical in unlocking other states.\n\n3. **Timing is Essential:**\n   - Pay attention to the timer. Since transformations appear to have a repeating timer, be strategic about when to activate and deactivate certain states to manipulate other sprites effectively.\n\n4. **Avoiding Blockages:**\n   - Since interaction with walls causes the player to step back, plan your movements to ensure you create clear paths for completing tasks without getting stuck.\n\n5. **Focus on Objective Completion:**\n   - Your primary focus should be on converting all `nook` sprites to `ok` using the `staff` in an efficient manner.\n   - Analyze the setup to find the fastest route between interactions while being mindful of the time limit.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can maximize your efficiency in solving the puzzle and meet the win conditions before the timeout occurs.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> a\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

    "content": "In the current state, I see that my avatar is located at (6, 3). The primary goal is to manipulate the states of `nook` (b and c) into `ok` (d) using the `staff`. \n\nTo achieve this, I must first identify interactable sprites near my position and their relationships. The immediate tiles around my avatar (6, 3) are:\n\n- Up (5, 3): `@` (lightoff)\n- Down (7, 3): `$` (wall)\n- Left (6, 2): `.` (floor)\n- Right (6, 4): `.` (floor)\n\nSince there are no `nook` or `ok` tiles near despite available movement options, I need to explore further. The actions I could take are:\n- Move UP to (5, 3): Reach lightoff tile; potential interaction can lead to transforming lights.\n- Move DOWN to (7, 3): Blocked by wall; cannot move.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 2): Open space; movement available.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 4): Also open space.\n\nConsidering that I don't want to move to a potentially less productive space, the best action is to move UP to (5, 3), activating the lightoff in the process, possibly setting up future moves.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect this will allow me to interact with the lightoff sprite, which is crucial for strategically transforming other sprites in the level.",
