Players navigate through a level filled with elements that require problem-solving to progress successfully. The presence of sprites, interactions, and transformation mechanics indicates a focus on creative thinking and spatial awareness.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different elements in the game, including:\n   - **Wall and Floor**: Structural elements that limit avatar movement.\n   - **Light Sprites**: Indicate changes in state (on/off).\n   - **Avatar and Staff**: The player's character interacts with the environment using a staff to transform other sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - Players can transform light states by interacting with their staff.\n   - Certain actions can trigger changes based on time, allowing for dynamic gameplay where mechanisms (like lights) switch states periodically.\n   - Interacting with 'ok' and 'nook' sprites allows players to move to different game states, potentially unlocking new areas or levels.\n\n3. **Timer Mechanic**: The game utilizes a timed mechanism, where certain transformations and interactions depend on a countdown (timer).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary goal is to achieve a **win condition** by transforming specific sprite types (nook to ok) to reach zero in a MultiSpriteCounter. You must effectively manage your time and the states of the lights to accomplish this.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: You win if you can transform all 'nook' sprites to 'ok' sprites until the MultiSpriteCounter reaches zero. \n- **Loss Condition**: You lose if you exceed the timeout limit of 1000 (the timer), meaning you need to complete the objectives within this time frame.\n\n### Level Layout\nThe level is bordered by walls, with pathways denoted by 'A' (avatar starting location), 'c', and 'a' representing various interactive states. The numbers (0 and 1) could indicate the transformation states or objectives that need to be achieved.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the level to understand where the avatar can move and which sprites are available for interaction.\n\n2. **Time Management**: Each interaction is dependent on timekeeping. Make sure to plan your moves carefully so that you can execute transformations before the timer runs out.\n\n3. **Chain Transformations**: Look for opportunities to trigger multiple transformations in a single play-through. For example, as your avatar interacts with time, aim to maximize the effect of light transformations and the movement of 'nook' to 'ok'.\n\n4. **Avoid Obstacles**: Keep in mind that colliding with walls will push you back (stepBack). Planning your moves well will minimize unnecessary delays.\n\n5. **Prioritize Objectives**: Focus first on transforming 'nook' sprites to 'ok' since that is crucial for winning. Use the on/off light mechanics to potentially unlock hidden areas or assist in the transformations.\n\nBy following this strategic approach and understanding the underlying mechanics, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the puzzle and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",
