Players must navigate a space, interact with various game objects, and solve challenges to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of static (immovable) and dynamic elements represented as sprites. Key sprites include:\n  - **Avatar**: The player character that performs actions.\n  - **Walls and Floors**: Define the boundaries and structure of the environment.\n  - **Light States**: Represented as `lighton` and `lightoff`, suggesting a mechanism involving light or visibility.\n  - **Hidden Sprites**: Such as `ok`, `nook`, and `transits`, which imply interactions that reveal or change states of objects.\n\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can interact with different sprites, leading to transformations that affect gameplay:\n  - Interacting with walls causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Utilizing a staff in different contexts changes states and progresses the game.\n  - Timer-based interactions can trigger transformations, impacting the environment and possibly opening new pathways or altering challenges.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach a win condition represented by the interaction between the \"nook\" and \"to_ok\" sprites. Players achieve this by managing the state of their surroundings using the avatar and the staff.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the player successfully transforms the `nook` sprite into `to_ok` without reaching the limit of a MultiSpriteCounter that counts instances of `nook` and `to_ok`.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if a timer exceeds 1000 units, implying that time management is crucial.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout and the positioning of walls, floors, and interactive elements. This will help in planning moves.\n  \n2. **Utilize the Staff Wisely**: Experiment with the staff against different sprites to trigger transformations. Understand the differences between `lighton` and `lightoff` to navigate the environment effectively.\n\n3. **Manage Time**: Since there is a timeout mechanic, strategize to solve puzzles efficiently within the time limit. Delay any unnecessary actions that could waste time.\n\n4. **Plan Transformations**: As you interact with the environment, pay attention to how each action (like changing light states) impacts the game\u2019s progression and modify your strategy accordingly.\n\n5. **Iterate and Experiment**: Given the transformative nature of sprite interactions, experimenting with different orders of actions can lead to discovering the optimal path to achieving the win condition.\n\nBy understanding the game mechanics, the layout, and wisely managing time and interactions, players can devise strategies to successfully navigate through the levels and achieve the ultimate goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

    "content": "From the current game state, the avatar is located at (6, 8) on an empty floor tile, which means there's an opportunity to explore the surroundings.\n\n### Analyzing the Environment:\n- Above the avatar at (5, 8) is a wall ($), so the avatar cannot move up.\n- To the left (6, 7) and right (6, 9) are also empty tiles.\n- Below (7, 8) is a wall as well.\n- The floor below (5, 6) contains dynamic tiles represented as '@', which may offer opportunities for interaction.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the layout, the avatar can only move left or right. Moving left may not directly help because it leads to empty space, which doesn't guarantee progress compared to moving in the other direction towards tiles and further exploration.\n\nSince the avatar's position is still unchanged from the last action, I will choose to move right towards (6, 9) to explore further.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will help me explore adjacent tiles in potentially fruitful directions while adhering to the previously noted strategy of moving into unexplored areas.",
