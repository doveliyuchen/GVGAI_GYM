It features a grid layout with various characters (sprites) and obstacles, where players must make strategic decisions to achieve their objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game includes multiple sprites with distinct roles (e.g., 'avatar', 'george', 'annoyed', 'quiet', and 'cigarette').\n   - **Avatar:** The main character controlled by the player.\n   - **George:** A chaser sprite that follows the player.\n   - **Annoyed and Quiet:** NPCs that can transform into each other under certain conditions.\n   - **Cigarette:** Can also be transformed based on interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers presenting layout navigation challenges.\n\n2. **Interactions:** \n   - If 'George' interacts with 'quiet', he transforms into 'annoyed'.\n   - The player can 'kill' George by interacting with him (which produces a -1 score).\n   - The 'annoyed' sprite can be transformed back into 'quiet' by interacting with the 'cigarette'.\n\n3. **Goal:** \n   - The objective seems to revolve around manipulating various sprites to avoid losing while trying to maintain a balance between avoiding George and managing the states of the quiet and annoyed NPCs.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game ends in a loss if the avatar is outnumbered (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' and 'quiet' indicates win=False).\n- There is a timeout limit of 1000, which allows the player to win if they still have the 'avatar' and 'quiet' sprites in play when the time runs out.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid George:** The player should prioritize avoiding interactions with George since he can lead to a reduction in the score when he is killed. Keep track of George's position and navigation patterns.\n\n2. **Manage the NPC States:** The player must strategically interact with the 'cigarette' to control the transformations from 'annoyed' to 'quiet'. Since the 'quiet' NPC contributes positively to the score, maintaining their presence and preventing them from being transformed into 'annoyed' is crucial.\n\n3. **Use Wall Obstacles:** Take advantage of walls to block George\u2019s path, which will limit his ability to chase the player effectively. Strategically navigating around walls can create a temporary safe zone.\n\n4. **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the timer. A timeout could be beneficial for players who are managing to keep both 'avatar' and 'quiet' sprites alive while avoiding George.\n\n5. **Scoring System:** Aim to maximize your score by maintaining 'quiet' sprites and avoiding unnecessary confrontations with George. Every sprite interaction should be calculated, keeping the score in mind.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can navigate the strategic elements of the game while mitigating the threats posed by the chasing sprite and ensuring they meet the win conditions outlined.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->

If I can move UP, I can assess future actions from there, preferably moving towards one of the `quiet` sprites or at least preparing for their proximity if George causes trouble.",
