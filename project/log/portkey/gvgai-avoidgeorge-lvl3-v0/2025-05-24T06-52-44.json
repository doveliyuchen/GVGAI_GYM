Remaining engaged in the game environment is essential to secure a win.\n\n### Strategy Recommendations:\n\n1. **Prioritize Targeting 'George'**:\n   - Focus on eliminating 'george' as soon as possible to prevent him from chasing you and to maintain a positive score.\n\n2. **Utilize Cigarettes Wisely**:\n   - Use the cigarettes to transform 'annoyed' citizens back into 'quiet' when necessary, as it grants score benefits. Balance the attacks between shooting cigarettes at 'george' and 'annoyed'.\n\n3. **Navigate the Environment**:\n   - Use the walls effectively for blocking paths and creating distance from the chaser ('george').\n   - Plan your movement through the level layout carefully, ensuring that you can access the cigarettes while avoiding the threats.\n\n4. **Manage the Timer**: \n   - Keep an eye on the timer and act efficiently to meet objectives. Plan out several moves ahead considering the movement speed of both 'george' and the 'avatar'.\n\nBy combining precise movement, timely use of shooting mechanics, and strategic planning, players can maximize their effectiveness within the game, potentially leading to a win before the timeout occurs.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->
