The player must navigate through a grid-like environment, manipulate objects (boxes), and manage resources (mana) to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Player Movement**: The avatar can move around the grid and interact with different sprites (walls, boxes, fire, etc.).\n2. **Resource Collection**: Collecting the mana resource increases the player's score.\n3. **Destruction and Transformation**: The avatar can shoot bullets that destroy walls and transform boxes into fire when they hit.\n4. **Hazards**: The environment includes hazards such as fire that can damage the avatar, with interaction rules that dictate consequences when in contact with various sprites.\n5. **Win/Loss Conditions**: The game ends if the player successfully reaches the goal sprite or if the avatar is destroyed (health points fall to zero).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the **goal** sprite (a green door) while managing health points and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The player wins if the `avatar` successfully reaches the `goal` sprite.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the `avatar`'s health points drop to zero, which can occur from fire contact or falling into traps created by the interactions in the game.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting mana as much as possible because it allows shooting bullets. More bullets can help in dealing with hazards by destroying walls or transforming boxes strategically.\n  \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be cautious around fire. Plan your movements to avoid getting hit. As fire can cause the avatar to lose health points quickly, dodging and navigating away from areas where fire can spread is crucial.\n\n3. **Manipulate the Environment**: Use bullets to interact with boxes effectively. Converting boxes into fire can help create barriers for enemies or hazards, but ensure it doesn\u2019t backfire and harm your health.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path**: Look at the level layout and identify safe paths. Create a strategy to navigate to the goal while maximizing resource collection and minimizing encounters with fire.\n\n5. **Use Walls to Your Advantage**: Walls can protect you from fire and other threats. Position yourself strategically behind walls when shooting or when disturbances occur in the environment.\n\n6. **Health Awareness**: Keep an eye on your health points. If you are low on health, prioritize avoiding hazards over collecting resources or shooting bullets unless necessary. \n\nBy following this strategy, players can optimize their gameplay to reach the goal efficiently while managing resources and avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nmana -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nbullet -> '*'\nbullet mana -> 'b'\nbox spark -> 'f'\nfire spark -> 'g'\nspark -> 'm'\nfireAsh -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> @\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> @\nrow=1, col=17 -> #\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> @\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> @\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> $\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> a\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
