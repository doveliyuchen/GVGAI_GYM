Players navigate through a grid-based layout with various obstacles, resources, and doors that require specific keys to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Movement and Interaction:**\n   - The player controls an avatar that can move around the grid and interact with different sprites (objects).\n   - Movement may involve bouncing off crates and walls or interacting with various surface types (water, mud, fire).\n\n2. **Resource Collection:**\n   - The player can collect multiple resources such as keys, boots, and chips, each influencing gameplay differently.\n   - Each type of key corresponds to specific doors (colored doors) that require the player to have collected the respective key to pass through.\n\n3. **Transformations and Consequences:**\n   - Certain interactions lead to transformations, like crates turning into mud when in contact with water, which can affect space and strategy.\n   - Some interactions can lead to the death of the avatar (e.g., stepping in mud, or hitting fire without appropriate gear).\n\n4. **Scoring and Limits:**\n   - Score can be increased through collecting chips, using specific doors, and accumulating resources.\n   - There are limits on certain resources that must be managed carefully (e.g., you can only hold certain keys or boots).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal is to navigate through the level, collecting necessary resources and overcoming obstacles to reach the exit. The player must ensure the avatar is alive and manage the resources correctly to win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the exit while adhering to any resource limits.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar's counter reaches zero, indicating the avatar has died or was unable to progress further.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize collecting keys and chips, as these are essential for passing through doors and increasing your score.\n   - Pay attention to the limits on resources; do not exhaust your keys or other essential resources.\n\n2. **Navigation and Interaction:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify which doors lead to required resources and plan your route effectively.\n   - Utilize crates to bounce yourself or explore sections of the map you might otherwise not reach.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious when approaching hazardous tiles (mud and fire); ensure you have the appropriate resources (like boots or flippers) to prevent death.\n   - Use interactions wisely; avoid unnecessary risk when interacting with obstacles that may kill the avatar.\n\n4. **Optimize the Path:**\n   - Try to plan your moves so that you collect resources while moving toward the exit in the most efficient manner. This might involve backtracking at times when keys are collected or other interactions are activated.\n\n5. **Keep Score in Mind:**\n   - Aim to maximize your score by collecting chips and using doors efficiently. Assess trade-offs between actions throughout gameplay.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players should be able to successfully navigate through levels, manage resources efficiently, and ultimately reach the exit while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> f\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> f\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> @\nrow=9, col=5 -> @\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",
