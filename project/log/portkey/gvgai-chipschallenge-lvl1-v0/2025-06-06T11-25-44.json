Collect chips and resources (keys and boots).\n2. Navigate and overcome obstacles represented by doors and hazards.\n3. Reach the exit to complete the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win: The player wins if all instances of the exit sprite are eliminated (collected) as indicated by the condition `SpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0 win=True`.\n- Loss: The player loses if the avatar sprite is eliminated (killed) which is tracked by `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Collect keys as early as possible, but also be mindful of how many of each type you have before encountering doors.\n   - Focus on picking up boots since they provide additional score benefits and may be essential for navigating hazardous areas.\n\n2. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Study the level layout to plan an efficient route. Identify which keys or items are needed to open doors and time your movements to avoid hazards (like fire or water).\n   - Use crates to bounce forward and potentially create new paths or clear obstacles.\n\n3. **Utilize Environment:**\n   - Be aware of how certain interactions affect the environment. For instance, using crates on water transforms it into mud, which can clear paths but also presents its own risks.\n\n4. **Prioritize Exits:**\n   - Near the end of your level completion, evaluate how many chips and resources you've collected and head towards the exit when conditions are favorable to ensure a smooth win condition.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Always ensure you have the necessary resources (like fire boots for fire hazards and flippers for water hazards) before attempting to cross dangerous areas, as these can result in immediate loss.\n\nBy carefully managing resources, planning routes, and utilizing game mechanics efficiently, players can successfully navigate through the levels and meet the game's objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nmud -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> f\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> a\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",
