    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game seems to fall under the **puzzle** platformer genre, incorporating elements of strategy and resource management due to the interactions with various keys, doors, and environmental obstacles.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Movement and Interaction**: Players control an avatar that can move around the level, interact with various sprites (like crates, keys, and doors), and collect resources (such as chips and special items).\n- **Resource Management**: The game incorporates multiple types of keys and specific boots, which are necessary to navigate certain areas and pass through various color-coded doors.\n- **Environmental Hazards**: Hazards like water, mud, and fire affect the avatar's ability to progress. The player must have specific items (flippers for water, fireboots for fire) to safely interact with these elements.\n- **Score System**: Collecting chips and acquiring keys yields points, impacting the player's score. Collecting certain resources also enables progression through the level.\n\n### Objectives\n- **Collect Keys and Resources**: The primary objective involves collecting various keys and additional resources to unlock doors and advance in the game.\n- **Reach the Exit**: The ultimate goal is to reach the exit while managing resources and avoiding threats to the avatar.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Players win by reaching the exit without failing to have the necessary requirements (resources) to pass through defined obstacles and doors.\n- **Loss Condition**: Players lose if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter indicates the avatar count is 0) due to hazards or failing specific conditions regarding resource limits.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Resource Collection**: Start by identifying and planning the optimal route for collecting keys and resources, ensuring to balance chip gathering with necessary key collection.\n2. **Navigating Hazards**: Always be cautious around water, mud, and fire. If you lack the required boots, you may need to temporarily avoid these areas or change your route.\n3. **Prioritizing Key Acquisition**: Collect keys in order of necessity for the doors you encounter. Understand which doors can be opened with the keys you have before exploring deeper parts of the level.\n4. **Using Crates**: Utilize crates to bounce, which may help navigate or possibly manipulate other sprites or obstacles in advantageous ways.\n5. **Beware of Limitations**: Constantly be aware of the resource limits for keys and boots, as exceeding them can lead to your avatar's death.\n6. **Efficient Route Planning**: Always assess and re-evaluate your movement within the level to minimize backtracking and efficiently reach the exit.\n\nBy adhering to this strategy, players can maximize their chances of successfully navigating the game while accumulating a high score. Proper management of resources, clever navigation through obstacles, and strategic planning are key to winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nmud -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> f\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> a\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",
