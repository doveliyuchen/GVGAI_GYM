    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's a comprehensive analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-adventure** game. It likely incorporates elements of exploration and resource management, as players must collect keys and traverse obstacles to complete levels.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**:\n  - **Immovable Objects**: The game features walls, crates, floors, doors, and environmental hazards (water, mud, fire).\n  - **Resources**: Players can collect various assets like keys (red, blue, green, yellow) and chips, which contribute to scoring and unlocking pathways.\n  - **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can interact with other sprites (e.g., collecting resources, encountering hazards).\n  - **Transitions**: Crates can bounce the avatar; water may transform crates into mud, and materials like fire or mud are deadly to the avatar unless certain conditions are met (e.g., wearing appropriate boots).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the **exit** while collecting resources and keys. Paying attention to interactions and using the collected resources strategically is crucial for advancing through doors that require specific keys.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by successfully reaching the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Collection**: Focus on collecting keys, boots, and chips to maximize potential for progression. \n2. **Traversal Strategy**:\n   - Avoid hazards like mud and water, unless you have the required equipment (flippers for water and fire boots for fire).\n   - Use crates strategically to navigate through spaces and to possibly bounce off them to access more locations.\n3. **Incremental Unlocking**:\n   - Prioritize collecting the keys required for the doors encountered in your path. Remember that each colored door can eliminate you if you do not have the corresponding key.\n   - Plan the order of visiting doors to ensure you can defeat or bypass obstacles effectively.\n4. **Exploration**: Take time to explore the level and pay attention to what each door and area requires before proceeding. Track your collected resources to manage your chances against dead ends.\n5. **Avoiding Hazards**: If you approach sections with water or fire, double-check that you have the necessary items equipped to survive passage.\n\nBy utilizing this strategy and keeping the interactions and hazards in mind, a player can successfully navigate the game and reach the exit while maximizing their score through resource collection.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nmud -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> f\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> a\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",

The avatar's current position is right next to a chip ('c') at (row=9, col=8) and also near the exit ('$') at (row=9, col=10).\n\nFrom the strategy, the primary focus should be on collecting resources and reaching the exit. The immediate next action I should take is to move to the right to collect the chip and towards the exit. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to be fruitful since it will allow the avatar to collect a chip and move towards the exit in a single move, closely following the strategy of maximizing resource collection and aiming for the exit.",
