The game's mechanics emphasize exploration, resource management, and strategic interaction with various objects and environments.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites that represent the environment (walls, floors, water, mud, fire) and resources (keys, boots, chips). Players interact with these sprites to achieve objectives.\n2. **Interaction System**: Players can interact with the environment in multiple ways. For instance:\n   - Players can collect resources like keys and chips.\n   - Certain sprites can transform into others (e.g., water into mud).\n   - Some interactions lead to player death (e.g., entering mud or water without the appropriate resources).\n3. **Resource Limitation**: The avatar has a limit to how many resources it can hold, creating an additional layer of strategy in managing resources effectively.\n4. **Doors & Gates**: Specific doors require certain keys to pass through, making resource management crucial.\n5. **Termination Conditions**: The game ends when the avatar either dies or successfully reaches the exit. The player wins by ensuring the avatar survives until reaching the exit.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, collect resources (keys, boots, chips), avoid hazards (water, mud, fire), and ultimately reach the exit. Players must strategically use resources to pass through various doors and gates.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they successfully reach the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (running out of life) before reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration & Resource Collection**: Start by exploring the level carefully. Focus on collecting resources, especially keys and boots, which are critical for navigating doors and avoiding hazards.\n   \n2. **Manage Resources Wisely**: Keep track of the resources collected. Use them strategically to pass through doors and avoid any kill conditions related to water and fire hazards.\n\n3. **Plan the Route**: Before interacting with sprites, observe the layout. Plan your route to minimize potential deaths. Avoid hazards like mud and water unless you possess the necessary resources (flippers or fire boots).\n\n4. **Utilize Crates**: Crates can help in maneuvering through the level. Use them to bounce forward or create a path to access hard-to-reach areas.\n\n5. **Prioritize Exiting**: While collecting resources is essential, prioritize reaching the exit once you have a satisfactory number of keys and items.\n\n6. **Remember the Undo Mechanic**: Take advantage of the undo feature for interactions. If an action results in a poor outcome, don\u2019t hesitate to backtrack.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can successfully navigate the challenges of the game, manage resources, and ultimately achieve the objective of reaching the exit while avoiding obstacles and managing risks effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nmud -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> f\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> a\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> @\nrow=9, col=5 -> @\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",
