Players navigate through a series of levels and must solve various puzzles by interacting with game objects to progress, while also avoiding hazards.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game has various sprites with different properties, including:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include walls, floors, water, mud, fire, and doors that serve as barriers or hazards.\n   - **Resource Sprites**: Keys (red, blue, green, yellow), chips (currency/resource), boots (movement enhancer), and flippers (swimming aid) can be collected to unlock doors or enhance gameplay.\n   - **Avatar**: This is the main character controlled by the player.\n   - **Exit Sprite**: Marks the area where the player completes the level.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game has various interaction rules:\n   - Collecting resources (keys, chips, boots) allows for progressing through the game.\n   - Certain sprites can cause instant defeat (e.g., mud, water without flippers, fire without fireboots).\n   - Certain doors (colored doors) require specific keys for passage.\n\n3. **Movement and Effects**: The player resolves puzzles primarily through navigating to collect keys and avoid pitfalls, while trying to reach the exit. There are elements that affect movement speed and ability based on collected items (e.g., boots and flippers).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to navigate from the starting point to the exit while collecting keys and other resources, avoiding hazards, and strategically solving puzzles to unlock doors that stand in the way.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- You lose (win=False) if the avatar sprite count reaches zero (indicating game over).\n- You win (win=True) when the player reaches the exit sprite, eliminating it and scoring points.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting keys and chips. Since there are limits on resources like keys, manage their usage wisely. Make sure you have the right key for doors in your path.\n\n2. **Hazard Awareness**: Be conscious of hazards (water, mud, fire). Make sure you have the necessary resources (flippers for water, fireboots for fire) to avoid dying. It\u2019s wise to explore paths cautiously.\n\n3. **Puzzle Solving**: Before interacting with doors or attempting to progress, survey the most efficient path through the level. Determine which keys you currently have and plan your route to collect necessary items while avoiding danger.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: Use backtracking judiciously, as some interactions and movements can allow retracing steps if a wrong direction is taken, or a resource is required to pass through a door.\n\n5. **Plan Exits**: Keep track of where the exit is located and ensure you can reach it without running out of the needed resources or getting trapped by hazards.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind and understanding the game's mechanics, you can effectively navigate through the challenges presented in each level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> f\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> f\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> a\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",
