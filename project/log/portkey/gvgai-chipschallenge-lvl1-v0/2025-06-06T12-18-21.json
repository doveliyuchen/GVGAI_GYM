    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, it appears to represent a puzzle-platformer genre with a focus on exploration and resource collection. Below is an analysis of the game mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Puzzle-Platformer**: The game involves navigating a map, solving environmental puzzles, and managing resources to progress.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Immovable Tiles**: There are different types of tiles (floor, water, mud, fire, walls, doors) that affect player navigation and interactions.\n   - **Keys and Doors**: Colored keys are needed to unlock corresponding doors, creating barriers and requiring players to gather resources strategically.\n   - **Collectibles**: Players can collect chips and special boots that provide bonuses or abilities.\n   - **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can interact with various tiles, perform actions like collecting resources, and face consequences based on what it interacts with.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce off crates, collect resources, and encounter death states based on interactions with mud (which kills the avatar) or other obstacles (water, fire).\n   - Various doors (red, blue, green, yellow) require specific keys and can lead to the avatar's death if conditions on resource limits are not met.\n   - The exit tile grants points when reached but is lethal if the avatar interacts improperly.\n\n3. **Transformations and Undoing**:\n   - Crates can transform water into mud, which is an essential mechanic for puzzle-solving.\n   - The undoing mechanic allows the avatar to reverse the last series of actions, adding a layer of strategic planning.\n\n### Objective\n- The primary objective is to navigate through the level, collect resources (keys, boots, chips), and ultimately reach the exit while avoiding lethal interactions. Collecting chips and other resources contributes to the score.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Players win by reaching the exit without their avatar being killed, which involves maintaining enough of the necessary resources.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is killed or if there are no exits left to interact with.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Prioritize collecting keys and boots early on to ensure access to various doors and safety from hazards.\n2. **Avoid Death**: Be mindful of hazardous locations, especially water and fire, and ensure the avatar has the corresponding resources (flippers and fireboots) to navigate through these areas safely.\n3. **Plan Your Path**: Before taking actions, consider how each move may affect the avatar's resources. Using the undo mechanic can help in reversing mistakes.\n4. **Collect All Points**: Since collecting chips contributes to score, always look for opportunities to gather them while progressing toward the exit.\n5. **Navigate Smartly**: Utilize bouncing off crates strategically to advance and avoid dangerous areas. This can also aid in transforming water into mud when necessary, allowing for safer movement.\n\nBy applying this strategy, players should be able to navigate challenges effectively and reach the exit successfully, all while maximizing their score through resource collection.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nmud -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> e\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> f\nrow=1, col=5 -> f\nrow=1, col=6 -> f\nrow=1, col=7 -> f\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> f\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> f\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> e\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> f\nrow=3, col=5 -> f\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> f\nrow=3, col=8 -> e\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=10 -> e\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> f\nrow=4, col=3 -> f\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> f\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> f\nrow=6, col=3 -> f\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> f\nrow=7, col=3 -> f\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> c\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> e\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> e\nrow=10, col=11 -> e",

Examining the surroundings:\n\n- Directly above (5, 4) is a floor tile (.)\n- Below (7, 4) is a crate (#)\n- To the left (6, 3) is an empty floor (.)\n- To the right (6, 5) is an empty floor (.)\n\nThere are also multiple collectibles and hazards in the vicinity, but none are immediately adjacent to my location. \n\nAccording to the strategy discussed earlier, I should prioritize collecting resources while avoiding hazards. Moving into an adjacent tile where I can either proceed to collect chips or open doors seems wise.\n\nCurrently, the best course of action is to move left or down to either collect more points or reposition for future strategic moves. Therefore, I will execute the action to move left (to (6, 3)), which is an empty tile and safe.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action allows the avatar to explore additional areas without entering into a harmful space, aligning with the strategy of resource collection and safe navigation.",
