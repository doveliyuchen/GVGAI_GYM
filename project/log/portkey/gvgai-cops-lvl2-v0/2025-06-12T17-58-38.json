After using it, try to collect another quickly from the depot if needed.\n\n2. **Enemy Engagement:**\n   - Engage thugs strategically: Consider eluding them at first to avoid unnecessary resource loss since they increase your villain count.\n   - Focus on defeating enemies that yield higher scores, especially the red thug that grants a valuable resource point.\n\n3. **Navigating the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the maze layout quickly to plan routes efficiently\u2014identify areas where enemies spawn and where important resources are located.\n   - Use walls effectively to shield yourself from enemy interactions. \n\n4. **Prioritize Boss Fight:**\n   - Ensure you engage the boss sprite quickly after the necessary conditions (defeating required thugs to spawn) are met. Time is of the essence.\n   - Evaluate if you need to gather additional resource points before attempting to confront the boss based on your strategy.\n\n5. **Adaptability:**\n   - Be prepared to change strategies on-the-fly based on enemy positions and behaviors. Each thug has a different speed, and recognizing these dynamics can provide advantages.\n\n6. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer constantly. Make sure you are not spending too much time on lower-value interactions and focus on key objectives, such as defeating thugs and ultimately, the boss.\n\nBy following these strategies and remaining adaptable to the game's pace and enemy behavior, players can increase their chances of winning within the allotted time frame.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

I will move up to (13, 2) where there are clear paths available to explore.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis move aligns with the strategy of navigating closer to key locations and avoiding unnecessary encounters, while also preparing to engage with the resources necessary to progress in the game.",
