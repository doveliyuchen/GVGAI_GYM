    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the given game rules, the genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a possible overall strategy can be surmised as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **top-down action puzzle or strategy game**. It involves navigating through a confined space (the map), interacting with various sprites (characters and objects), and completing specific objectives within a time limit.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent different objects and characters:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Such as walls, floors, and jail doors that players cannot pass through.\n   - **Thugs and Villains**: These are adversarial entities that must be dealt with, either by collecting resources they represent or navigating around them.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that interacts with the environment and other sprites.\n   - **Keys**: Represent a resource the player must collect to unlock the jail door.\n   - **Transitional Sprites**: These represent potential score increases once conditions regarding the villains are met.\n   \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can collect keys, which are crucial for accessing the jail door.\n   - Thugs are enemies that need to be confronted, and defeating them changes the player's resources.\n   - The jail acts as a spawning point for transitional sprites that yield score boosts when defeated.\n\n3. **Score System**: Players earn scores for defeating specific types of villains which encourage strategic interactions.\n\n### Objectives\n- Collect the key to unlock the jail door and ultimately defeat the boss.\n- Increase the score by defeating various types of thugs and villains, with varying scores for each type.\n- Aim to deplete the boss sprite's existence for a win.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the player successfully defeats the boss sprite (which is restricted in how many can exist).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game will be lost if the time limit (1900 units) is reached without defeating the boss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Key Collection**: Gathering the key is essential for getting through the jail door, so make this your first objective.\n   \n2. **Manage Encounters**: Engage with thugs and villains strategically. Try to defeat the thugs to build your resource count without getting overwhelmed.\n   \n3. **Utilize Resources Wisely**: Keep track of your resources and interactions. Carefully manage your health and resource count to maximize your chances of defeating enemies efficiently.\n\n4. **Focus on the Jail**: Once you have enough resources, head to the jail, but be cautious of surrounding enemies. Use smart movements to prevent getting trapped or overwhelmed.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Work on defeating the villains in a target order based on the score they provide, ensuring you maximize your points as you progress.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Keep a close watch on the timer. Plan your moves and ensure you are progressing toward your objectives without delay.\n\nBy adhering to this strategy and understanding the game's mechanics and objectives, players can effectively increase their chances of winning within the given constraints.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

Following the outlined strategy, we should prioritize our movements toward locating resources and objectives, such as the key and the jail door.\n\n### Key Locations to Consider:\n- **Jail Door** is found at (row 3, col 7) and (row 5, col 4).\n- **Depot Key** represented as 'j' is crucial but currently not visible on the map. We might have to navigate through the enemy areas to find out its exact position, then move toward the jail door located at (row 3, col 7).\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Assess Movements**: The avatar is surrounded by an open area directly below and beside (row 10-15), meaning movements are available.\n2. **Maximize Visibility**: Move the avatar to scan potential areas below.\n3. **Map Knowledge**: The immediate area doesn\u2019t provide key access, thus directing myself towards unvisited spaces is the next step.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar down to (row 10, col 5) where I can re-assess the available sprites for potential exploration or resource collection. This aligns with our strategy of exploring efficiently to gather resources while also keeping an eye on timing constraints.",
