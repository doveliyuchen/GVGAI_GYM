It features elements of stealth and resource management, suggesting a gameplay style similar to classic titles where players navigate mazes filled with enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**: The game involves various sprites, including walls, doors, characters (avatar/cops, thugs, villains), and resources (keys). The **avatar** can move and interact with these sprites.\n   \n2. **Resource Collection**: Players collect resources (keys and villains) while avoiding or interacting with enemies. Resources can change based on interactions, often resulting in either they being collected or lost.\n\n3. **Goal-Oriented Interactions**:\n    - Collecting keys allows access to certain areas (e.g., jaildoor).\n    - Interacting with specific enemies (thugs and villains) grants resource gains, contributing to the score.\n    - Interactions with jails lead to unique gameplay elements such as spawning resources or scoring points.\n\n4. **Enemy Behavior**: Enemies (e.g., thugs, boss) have different types and behaviors, such as fleeing or attacking the player, adding an element of danger and requiring strategic movement to avoid confrontation.\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective is to **navigate the maze**, collect keys, eliminate thugs, free captured villains, and ultimately defeat the boss. The game seems to have a scoring system based on the types of villains defeated.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - The player wins the game by defeating the boss (indicated by the sprite counter for the boss reaching 0) or resources related to defeating thugs being collected.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: \n  - If the timer runs out (timeout limit is 1900) without defeating the boss, the player loses.\n  \n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement and Avoidance**: Focus on avoiding thugs and other villains initially to prioritize gathering keys and resources. Understanding the enemy's movement patterns can help line up your own strategies for dodging.\n\n2. **Key Allocation**: Manage your key resource wisely, possibly avoiding unnecessary interactions that could lead to resource depletion. Only approach the jaildoor when you\u2019re sure you can open it or need to utilize the key immediately.\n\n3. **Prioritize Thug Engagement**: Engage thugs when you're confident you can eliminate them without exhausting resources or risking getting hit. Each thug provides different villain resources which are crucial for scoring.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Keep track of how many villains you've captured and which resources you've collected. This will help in planning your next moves and ensuring you're progressing toward unlocking the jail and eventually defeating the boss.\n\n5. **Understand the Environment**: Use the layout to your advantage. Look for bottlenecks where you can corner thugs or evade them. Knowing the maze's structure will also help you find resources quickly.\n\n6. **Boss Encounter Prep**: Ensure you have enough resources and a good strategy before facing the boss, as they potentially provide a large score increase but also pose a significant threat.\n\nBy following these strategies and maintaining a focus on resource management and enemy avoidance, you can improve your chances of defeating the boss and achieving a high score in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

There are jail doors at (1, 12), (1, 13), (2, 12), and (2, 13) which could be worth exploring but require keys.\n3.
