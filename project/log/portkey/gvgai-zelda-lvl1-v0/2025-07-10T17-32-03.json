You have to explore a level laid out like a maze, solve a key\u2013door puzzle, and deal with roaming enemies.\n\u2003\u2013 The game mixes strategy (finding paths, collecting keys) with limited combat (using a sword attack) and some light arcade action (dodging or shooting enemies).\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 You control an \"avatar\" that can shoot a \u201csword\u201d (its attack) at enemies. The sword has a limited duration (flickers for a short time) so you must time your attacks.\n\u2003\u2013 The level contains a key and a door (goal). There\u2019s a twist: your character initially appears as \u201cnokey,\u201d and when you pick up the key, your character transforms to \u201cwithkey.\u201d Only when carrying the key can you interact with the door in the proper way.\n\u2003\u2013 Enemies (like monsters with different speeds) roam the level randomly. They can be grabbed by your sword attack for extra score, but if your avatar bumps into an enemy directly, you\u2019re penalized (score \u20131) and might risk being removed.\n\u2003\u2013 Movable objects (and walls) interact with each other with push-back rules, so movement through the maze may require repositioning objects.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The overall goal is to unlock and use the door. You need to collect the key (by touching it, which transforms your sprite from \u201cnokey\u201d to \u201cwithkey\u201d) and then go to the door.\n\u2003\u2013 When a character carrying the key touches the door (\u201cgoal withkey\u201d), the door is \u201ckilled\u201d (removed) and you score, signaling level completion (win condition).\n\u2003\u2013 You lose the level if your avatar is removed from play (for instance, by repeated contact with enemies, as there\u2019s a termination condition tied to the avatar\u2019s count).\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Begin by exploring the maze to locate the key. Because your character is in the \u201cnokey\u201d form, you can\u2019t use the door yet.\n\u2003\u2013 Keep an eye on roaming enemies. Use your sword attack carefully to eliminate them when necessary, rather than colliding with them directly\u2014direct contact leads to a score penalty and possible danger.\n\u2003\u2013 Once you secure the key (your avatar transforms to \u201cwithkey\u201d), focus on plotting a safe route to the door. Avoid unnecessary skirmishes and use your shot-sword only when an enemy blocks a critical path.\n\u2003\u2013 Learn the maze layout: use the walls and floor to your advantage to maneuver around monsters. Since some enemies move at different speeds (quick, normal, slow), timing your movements is key.\n\u2003\u2013 Balance risk and reward: sometimes eliminating an enemy with the sword scores you points but overusing it (given its limit) might leave you vulnerable later.\n\nIn short, be methodical: explore the maze, grab the key to unlock the opportunity to finish the level at the door, and handle enemies smartly by using your sword rather than risking costly collisions. This combines careful navigation with timely combat for an engaging puzzle-action challenge.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'k'\nwithkey -> 'm'\nsword wall -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> s\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> m\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
