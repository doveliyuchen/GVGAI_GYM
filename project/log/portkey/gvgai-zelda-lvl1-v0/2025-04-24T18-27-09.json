The player\u2019s avatar navigates a grid-based environment, interacts with various sprites (objects), collects items, and confronts enemies.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, each with specific attributes and interactions:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Goal**: A green door that requires the player to have a key to be interacted with successfully.\n   - **Key**: An item needed to unlock the goal.\n   - **Sword**: A weapon used to defeat enemies.\n   - **Enemies**: Different types of NPCs with varying speeds and spawning rates, which the player must combat.\n   - **Walls**: Immovable obstacles in the game environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar must collect the key (if not already possessed) to reach the goal.\n   - The avatar can defeat enemies using a sword, but if an enemy makes contact with the avatar, the player loses points.\n   - The player must backtrack if they attempt to interact with the goal without the key, and cannot proceed if they encounter walls or obstacles.\n\n3. **Movement**:\n   - The avatar navigates a grid layout where walls block movement.\n   - The avatar can step back if it collides with certain sprites, like goals or movable walls.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal (green door) by collecting the key and defeating enemies to score points. The player must efficiently navigate the level, manage encounters with enemies, and utilize the sword effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the number of keys collected (as indicated by interacting with the key sprite) reaches the goal.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player\u2019s avatar loses if it is defeated by an enemy (which deducts score points). If the avatar is \"killed\" or the sprite counter for the avatar indicates defeat, the game is considered lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Key Collection**: Focus on reaching the key sprite as quickly as possible. This will allow you to unlock the goal (green door).\n\n2. **Combat Tactics**: Use the sword to defeat enemies as you progress. Be mindful of your health or score, as losing points can impact your standing.\n\n3. **Navigate Smartly**: Avoid unnecessary encounters with enemies if you can dodge them or if they are unnecessary for key collection. Maneuvering wisely to avoid damage and score penalties is crucial.\n\n4. **Understand Enemy Behavior**: The type of enemy encountered can determine how you approach combat. The 'monsterQuick', 'monsterNormal', and 'monsterSlow' differ in their speed and behavior. Tackle slower enemies when health is low or you\u2019re cornered by faster ones.\n\n5. **Plan Movement**: The grid layout offers distinct paths to navigate. Always have an escape route in mind in case you need to step back or change direction after an encounter with an enemy or wall.\n\n6. **Keep Score in Mind**: Since the score can directly affect win/loss conditions, balancing aggression in combat with safe navigation will be vital to maintaining a high score while progressing toward victory.\n\nBy following this strategy while remaining adaptable to different situations in the level, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the game\u2019s objective and defeating enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw.&.@w....%.w\nw..www......w\nw..........$w\nw.......wwwww\nw.......w#..w\nw...w...w...w\nw*..w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw*......w\nw......&w\nw.....w.w\nwww...w@w\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw.......w\nw.www...w\nw..#w...w\nw...w..%w\nw...w$..w\nwwwwwwwww",
