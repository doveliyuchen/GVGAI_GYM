The level is laid out like a maze with walls, floors, a key, a goal (door), and several creatures (monsters). Here\u2019s a breakdown of its elements and a suggested overall strategy:\n\n\u2022 Game Genre and Objective:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a puzzle\u2013action game that combines exploration, combat, and item collection.\n\u2003\u2013 The main goal is to \u201cexit\u201d the level by getting through the door (goal). However, you must be carrying the key to do so: without the key you\u2019ll be blocked by the door.\n\u2003\u2013 The level is also populated with enemies (the various monsters and/or enemy sprites), which you can defeat for points but must be avoided if they threaten your life.\n\n\u2022 Key Mechanics:\n\u20031. Movement and Collisions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The level is a maze of walls (which cause you to \u201cstep back\u201d when bumped) and open floor spaces.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If you try to reach the door (goal) without the key while in your \u201cnokey\u201d state, you\u2019re pushed back. Only when you have the key (i.e. transformed to the \u201cwithkey\u201d state) does approaching the door work \u2013 it destroys the door sprite (and you win).\n\u20032. Collecting the Key:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There is a key item on the level. When your \u201cnokey\u201d avatar contacts it, you are transformed into the \u201cwithkey\u201d version and earn a bonus. This means you now have the means to open the door.\n\u20033. Combat:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Your avatar is equipped with a sword ability (you \u201cshoot\u201d a sword flicker that can defeat enemies).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Contact between an enemy and your sword results in destroying the enemy (and earning extra points).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Be wary: if you (as the avatar) come in contact with an enemy directly, it will hurt you (reflected by a negative score change) and could lead to your defeat.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There are several enemy types (fast, normal, and slow) which likely behave differently based on cooldowns and movement, so adapt your combat on the fly.\n\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 You win when you successfully use your key (with the \u201cwithkey\u201d form) at the door (goal), effectively \u201ckilling\u201d (or deactivating) the goal sprite.\n\u2003\u2013 You lose (or the level ends badly) if your avatar is killed by enemy contact.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Move Cautiously and Plan Your Path:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Study the maze layout to plan a route that minimizes your exposure to wandering enemies.\n\u20032. Secure the Key Early:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Prioritize collecting the key. Only after you\u2019ve transformed into the \u201cwithkey\u201d state can you interact with the door.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoid rushing blindly if enemies are nearby; use your sword wisely so that you clear a safe path.\n\u20033. Manage Enemy Encounters:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use the sword attack to eliminate or keep enemies at bay without getting caught. Remember that your sword shot (a flickering effect that lasts for a short interval) is your best defense.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Beware of direct collision with enemies; always try to engage them from a distance using your attack.\n\u20034. Head for the Goal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Once you have the key, approach the door. The game\u2019s rules allow you to \u201ckill\u201d (or deactivate) the door sprite if you\u2019re carrying the key, which finalizes your win.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Watch for enemies near the goal area and clear them if necessary.\n\nIn summary, the key to success in this game is to navigate the maze carefully, collect the key to unlock your win condition, and use your sword attacks to manage and eliminate threats along the way. Balancing cautious exploration with timely combat is your best overall strategy.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'k'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> m\nrow=1, col=4 -> k\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
