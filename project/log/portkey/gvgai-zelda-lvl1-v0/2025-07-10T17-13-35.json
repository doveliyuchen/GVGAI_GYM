    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle/Action with Rogue-lite elements (due to scoring). It's a single-screen challenge.\n\n**Game Objective:** The player, controlling an avatar, needs to reach and open the `goal` (door) to win.\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The avatar can move around the level.\n*   **Shooting:** The avatar `ShootAvatar` behavior suggest it shoot some bullet to attack.\n*   **Keys:** The player needs to find a key (`key`) to open the goal. The avatar appearance changes to `withkey` when it has the key.\n*   **Enemies:** There are enemies (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`) that move randomly.\n*   **Combat:** The player can attack enemies.\n*   **Walls:** There are walls that block movement.\n*   **Scoring:** Killing enemies (`enemy sword`) gives positive score (+2), picking up key (`nokey key`) gives positive score (+1), reaching goal `goal withkey` gives positive score (+1) but dying by touching enemy (`avatar enemy`) penalizes score (-1).\n\n**Win Condition:** The player wins when all `goal` sprites are removed, implying the avatar reached the goal with the key.\n\n**Loss Condition:** The player loses if the `avatar` sprite is removed, meaning the avatar died (likely by colliding with enemies without a sword).\n\n**Sprite Summary:**\n\n*   `floor`: Just background.\n*   `goal`: The door to open.\n*   `key`: Needed to open the door.\n*   `sword`: Seems to be some ammo or projectile for attack, limited to 5\n*   `avatar`: The player character.\n*   `nokey`: Avatar without the key.\n*   `withkey`: Avatar with the key.\n*   `enemy`: Generic enemy type.\n*   `monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`: Different types of enemies that move at different speeds.\n*   `wall`: Obstacles.\n\n**Level Layout Notes:**\n\n*   'A' is the starting position of the avatar.\n*   'g' is the goal.\n*   '+' is the key.\n*   '1', '2', '3' are probably monsters since they are referenced in Sprite section.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key First:** Prioritize getting the key.\n2.  **Enemy Avoidance/Combat:** Be careful around enemies. Use the sword to kill enemies. Consider enemy movement patterns to avoid being cornered.\n3.  **Path Planning:** Plan the route to the key and then to the goal, taking into account enemy positions and movement.\n4.  **Resource Management:** Conserve the `sword`, use it wisely.\n5.  **Score Awareness:** Balance the risk of engaging enemies for points against the risk of dying and losing.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> *\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
