It mixes arcade shooting (your avatar fires sword projectiles) with puzzle-like manipulation of characters and objects in a maze-like level.\n\n\u2022 Mechanics and How Things Work\n\u2003\u2013 The level is laid out in a grid with walls, floors, and various interactive objects.\n\u2003\u2013 You control the avatar (a shooter) that can fire a \u201csword\u201d projectile.\n\u2003\u2013 There are several NPCs: one type is a \u201cnokey\u201d swordman who, if he touches a key, transforms into a \u201cwithkey\u201d version (this transformation scores points).\n\u2003\u2013 The key and the goal (a door, colored green) are special items. The goal is \u201copened\u201d (or removed) when a withkey character touches it, scoring a point.\n\u2003\u2013 There are also roaming monsters with different speeds (quick, normal, slow) that move at random and can harm your avatar.\n\u2003\u2013 Collisions are handled with simple rules. For example, if the avatar touches an enemy, the enemy is killed but you lose points (and possibly risk death). In contrast, using your sword projectile against an enemy gives you extra points.\n\u2003\u2013 There are \u201cstepBack\u201d interactions as well so that moving objects (or characters) might be pushed back if they bump into something immovable like a wall.\n\n\u2022 Objectives, Win, and Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2013 The overall objective is to \u201copen the door\u201d by having a withkey (the transformed swordman) reach the goal sprite. When the goal is removed (i.e. after a correct collision) the game is won.\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is eliminated. So staying safe from the roaming monsters and from hazardous collisions is essential.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy\n\u2003\u2013 First, consider how to get the key into play: Encourage or allow a nokey sprite to come into contact with the key so it transforms into a withkey sprite.\n\u2003\u2013 Then, clear a safe path for that withkey character to reach the door (the goal) without interference from monsters.\n\u2003\u2013 Use your shooting ability to eliminate enemies that might block the path or threaten your avatar\u2014remember that shooting enemies scores points.\n\u2003\u2013 Keep an eye on the different roaming monsters: Their speeds and random paths mean timing is important. Avoid close encounters, as colliding with an enemy in your avatar form can be costly.\n\u2003\u2013 In summary, manage the environment by balancing offense (using your sword projectile on dangerous enemies) with indirect puzzle solving (helping a non-player character get the key and deliver it to the door).\n\nThis mix of careful positioning, timely shooting, and indirect puzzle management is at the heart of the game\u2019s challenge and strategy. Enjoy the mix of action and brain work!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nsword wall -> 'n'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
