    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThe game appears to be a 2D action-puzzle adventure game, incorporating elements where players interact with various game sprites while navigating a maze-like environment filled with enemies and items.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Several types of sprites exist, including static objects (walls, floors), goals, keys, and monsters/enemies. \n- **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar (a character) that can shoot a sword and transform based on interactions. The avatar's state is key; it can become equipped with a key (\"withkey\") to interact with specific goals.\n- **Interactions:** \n  - The player must collect keys to open corresponding doors (goals), indicated by the green door sprite.\n  - Enemies can be attacked using a sword, allowing for score changes (positive for defeating enemies, negative if the avatar is defeated).\n  - Collisions with walls can force the avatar to step back, and certain enemy types have different cooldowns and consequences.\n  \n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal (door) represented by the green sprite. To access it, the player must first collect the orange key and ensure they have transformed their avatar accordingly.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal with the key (\"goal withkey\"), which results in a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated (sprite counter for the avatar goes to zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Study the layout of the environment. Knowing where walls, enemies, and the goal are located will help plan your movements effectively.\n\n2. **Key Collection:** Prioritize obtaining the key first. Engage with the 'nokey key' interaction to transform into 'withkey,' making you eligible to access the goal.\n\n3. **Enemy Management:** Be strategic when dealing with enemies. Attempt to avoid unnecessary engagements unless you can safely defeat them to score points. Use the sword wisely to maintain health and resources.\n\n4. **Movement Strategy:** Use the walls to your advantage for defense. If an enemy approaches, utilize the structures around you to dodge and control the battle flow.\n\n5. **Resource Management:** Monitor your avatar's state. Avoid confrontational choices that might lead to a game-over situation. Assess when to attack or retreat.\n\n6. **Puzzles Integration:** Understanding the interaction between doors, walls, keys, and enemies will assist in navigating the levels more effectively.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate this action-puzzle adventure, work towards completing the levels, and achieve a high score while avoiding defeat.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nsword -> 'm'\nnokey sword -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The closest goal is at (row 1, col 4), and there are key items along with walls surrounding it.\n\nCurrently, I need to determine my position to choose the best action. Since there's no explicit information about my avatar's current position in the provided state, I'll assume the avatar is positioned adjacent to the key or the goal, as those are critical locations.\n\n**Assuming my avatar is at (row 5, col 9), where the key '#' is located**, my immediate objective should be to collect it. This will transform my avatar state and allow me to later reach the goal. \n\nGiven the available actions and considering the strategic rules, the best course of action would be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action corresponds to using the key. I'm expecting this will help me to collect the key where I am located and transform my avatar into the state \"withkey\", enabling access to the goal afterward.",
