It incorporates exploration, combat, and item collection (keys) to progress through levels.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different sprites have specific roles, such as the avatar, enemies, keys, and the goal. \n   - The **'avatar'** can shoot a sword and has two states: holding a key (withkey) and not holding a key (nokey). \n   - **Enemies** come in different types (quick, normal, slow) and interact with the avatar in a way that can lead to gaining or losing points.\n   - **Walls** are immovable, creating barriers that the player must navigate around.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites, primarily focusing on collecting the key to unlock the door (goal) and defeating enemies.\n   - Interactions can lead to transformations, such as the avatar changing state when picking up the key.\n   - Enemy interactions can result in either losing points (if the avatar is attacked) or gaining points (by defeating them).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the **goal** (the green door) and successfully enter it after collecting the **key**. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if the sprite counter for the **goal** reaches a winning condition (the avatar enters the goal while possessing the key).\n- The player loses if the sprite counter for the **avatar** reaches a losing condition (the avatar is defeated by enemies).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore and Collect**: First, explore the area to collect the **key**. This is essential for accessing the door (goal). The layout hints at various pathways and obstacles, implying a need for exploration.\n\n2. **Combat Strategy**: \n   - Prioritize defeating enemies to gain points and avoid being defeated. Understand each enemy\u2019s cooldown period to strategize your attacks and retreats effectively.\n   - Use the sword wisely; attacking an enemy yields points while being attacked results in losing points.\n\n3. **Progress Systematically**: Make sure to clear paths and consider the layout of the wall and enemy positions. Look for ways to avoid unnecessary confrontations, especially if you're low on health or points.\n\n4. **Timing Key Interactions**: Once you collect the key, navigate back to the goal promptly. Ensure to avoid enemies on your way back to maximize your chances of winning.\n\n5. **Safety Protocol**: Always be wary of the enemy interactions. Maintain a distance if you\u2019re at risk of losing points.\n\nBy following this strategy, the player can maximize their points, reach the goal, and successfully complete the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
