The use of an avatar, enemies, collectibles (keys), and a goal suggests a game where players navigate a space while overcoming obstacles and defeating enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Movement and Interaction:**\n   - The player controls an avatar that can move within a confined space (the map).\n   - Various sprites represent different game elements with distinct functions (goals, keys, enemies, walls).\n   \n2. **Collecting Items:**\n   - The avatar can collect a key ('withkey') to unlock the green door (goal).\n   - Engaging with a key when lacking one transforms the avatar, allowing progression in the game.\n\n3. **Combat:**\n   - The avatar can defeat enemies using a sword; killing enemies grants the player score points.\n   - The game includes enemy sprites with different cooldowns, suggesting varied attack patterns or response times.\n\n4. **Obstacles:**\n   - Movable and immovable walls restrict movement in certain areas.\n   - The presence of non-combat interactions (e.g., stepping back when encountering certain situations) introduces strategy in navigating the layout.\n\n#### Objective:\n- The primary objective is to **reach the goal**, which requires collecting a key if the avatar starts without one. Unlocking the door (goal) is necessary for a win condition.\n- Defeating enemies also provides an additional scoring mechanic, encouraging players to engage with these sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal ('goal withkey') and achieving a score increment.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends if the avatar is killed ('spriteCounter stype=avatar win=False'), indicating loss through health depletion or encountering a defeating situation.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore Thoroughly:** \n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout and identify where keys and enemies are located. This helps in planning movements.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:** \n   - If starting with 'nokey', strategize to reach and collect the 'key' sprite without engagement from enemies, if possible. Transform into the 'withkey' avatar.\n\n3. **Engage Wisely:**\n   - Decide when to fight enemies (for additional score) versus when to avoid them (to prevent losing avatar health). Weigh the risks depending on enemy type and proximity.\n\n4. **Manage Movement:**\n   - Be mindful of wall interactions, whether they are movable or immovable, and plan to navigate around/through these walls effectively.\n\n5. **Progress Towards the Goal:**\n   - Once equipped with the key, head straight to the goal to secure the win. Keep an eye out for potential enemies along the path to avoid unnecessary damage.\n\nBy combining exploration, strategic combat, and careful movement, players can optimize their chances of winning the game while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nsword -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> k\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current map state and the player avatar's position 'a', we analyze our next actions:\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar is on row 7, column 5, denoted as '*', which means it is currently in a state of not having a key (nokey).\n- The goal ('@') is located at row 1, column 4 (k), and a key ('#') is available at row 5, column 9.\n- Moving towards row 5, column 9 to collect the key is essential, as the avatar cannot access the goal without it.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. From the current position (row 7, col 5), the immediate upward position (row 6, col 5) is occupied by a quick monster ('%').\n2. A direct upward move may be too risky as it may result in losing health. Therefore, we need to choose a safer route.\n\n### Strategy Suggestion:\nTo reach the key at (5, 9), it's advisable to move through the safest path while avoiding the monster. Since the upper row (row 6) is dangerous, we can first navigate around safely while observing the situation.\n\n1. Move left to row 7, col 4 (which is a floor).\n2. From there, execute upward movements towards (5,9) where the key is located while avoiding the monster.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince immediate upward action is blocked, I'll first take a step left.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left to row 7, col 4 allows for better positioning to plan the next move towards obtaining the key.",
