Game Genre and Core Mechanics\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game\u2014very much in the spirit of classical Sokoban puzzles.  \n\u2003\u2022 You control an avatar (a knight sprite) that moves around the level, pushing boxes around.\n\u2003\u2022 The playing area is laid out as a tile grid with walls making boundaries and obstacles.\n\n2. Key Game Elements and How They Interact\n\u2003\u2022 Walls and Floor: Walls (with autotiling) and floor/ground tiles form the static environment. When the avatar bumps into a wall, it \u201csteps back\u201d (i.e. cannot pass through).\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes and their Transformations:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The boxes come in two \u201cstates\u201d: the normal box and a transformed version (\u201cboxin\u201d).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When a normal box is pushed onto a hole (represented by a dark-blue sprite), it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d and you receive a small score bonus.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Conversely, if a \u201cboxin\u201d is moved onto a ground sprite, it transforms back to a normal box with a small score penalty.  \n\u2003\u2022 Collision Dynamics:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s a secondary collision rule where interactions between the avatar and other passive objects (bbox) result in a \u201cbounceForward\u201d effect.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s possible that when boxes hit walls, an \u201cundoAll\u201d rule might reset unintended moves.\n\n3. The Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2022 The win condition is met when all normal boxes (\u201cbox\u201d sprites) are removed from the board\u2014the SpriteCounter for \u201cbox\u201d reaches zero.  \n\u2003\u2022 While the rules emphasize transformation between box and boxin states (and even involve score changes), ultimately you must manipulate these objects so that no normal box remains. (It appears that the transformation mechanism is at the heart of solving the puzzle: use the holes and ground interactions to \u201cprocess\u201d each box correctly.)\n\n4. Overall Strategy and Tactical Approach\n\u2003\u2022 Think Ahead: As with Sokoban puzzles, careful planning is essential. Plan your moves so that boxes are pushed into positions where their subsequent transformation is possible without getting stuck.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the Environment:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Push boxes onto holes to trigger the transformation into boxin. Note the score change; this may be part of meeting bonus or penalty goals, but the primary goal remains clearing boxes.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then move the newly transformed boxin onto ground areas for the reverse transformation. You might need to consider the order\u2014sometimes doing a transformation then \u201cundoing\u201d it is part of the solution.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Deadlocks: Don\u2019t push boxes into corners or against walls in such a way that they cannot be further manipulated by your avatar.\n\u2003\u2022 Consider Collision Reactions: The bounce and \u201cundoAll\u201d reactions indicate that if boxes are pushed wrongly (or if collisions are mishandled), you might need to backtrack. Use these \u201csafety nets\u201d to experiment carefully rather than making irreversible moves.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re looking at a puzzle game where careful spatial reasoning and planning are paramount. Your main challenge is to manipulate boxes using the available holes and ground triggers to eventually remove all of the normal boxes from play. Work methodically, avoid creating unsolvable situations, and use the transformation mechanics to your advantage in reaching the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",
