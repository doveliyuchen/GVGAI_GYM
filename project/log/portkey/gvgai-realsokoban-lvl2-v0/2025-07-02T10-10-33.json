    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle platformer**, where players must manipulate objects within a grid-based environment to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: `floor`, `ground`, `hole`, `wall` which are barriers or surfaces.\n   - **Avatar**: `avatar` that can move around the game grid.\n   - **Blocks**: `box` and `boxin` represent movable objects that interact with other game elements.\n   - **Bouncing and Transformations**: The `bbox` is a passive object that drives some interactions, like bouncing the avatar back or transforming boxes.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce back when colliding with walls.\n   - The avatar can push boxes that bounce off the walls or can fall into holes for scoring.\n   - Boxes that are transformed into boxin generate points (scoreChange).\n\n3. **Score Mechanics**:\n   - **Scoring**: Transposing a box into a hole gives +1 point, while placing a transformed box back on the ground deducts 1 point.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective of the game is to transform all `box` sprites into `boxin` sprites by moving them into the `hole` in the level. The game is won when the `SpriteCounter` associated with `box` reaches zero.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Achieving zero `box` sprites left on the board.\n- **Loss Condition**: Not explicitly stated, but potentially could involve running out of moves or time, or having a situation where no further actions can lead to a victory.\n\n### Level Overview:\n- The level layout is encapsulated by walls (`w`), and the player starts at an 'A' position. \n- There are blocks (`*` and `o`) positioned strategically, with holes (o) allowing for scoring.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before you start, look at the layout carefully to plan how to make efficient moves. Identify which boxes can reach the holes and in what order.\n\n2. **Avoid Penalties**: Be cautious about placing transformed boxes back to the ground as it will deduct from your score.\n\n3. **Utilize Bouncing**: Use the bouncing mechanics effectively to move boxes into desirable positions without getting stuck.\n\n4. **Sequential Transformations**: Aim to transform as many boxes as possible in a single sweep of movements to maximize efficiency.\n\n5. **Test Different Paths**: If you're stuck, consider experimenting with different sequences of moves to see if new opportunities arise.\n\nUsing these strategies should help players generate high scores while advancing towards the win condition efficiently. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> a\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> #\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",

Up `(2, 1)`: to empty ground `.`.\n2. Down `(4, 1)`: to empty ground `.`.\n3. Left `(3, 0)`: this is blocked by a wall `$`.\n4. Right `(3, 2)`: this is also empty ground `.`.\n\n**Moving Left is not possible** due to the wall. Moving Up or Down leads to empty grounds, and a **move Right** also keeps the possibilities open.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nFrom `(3, 1)`, moving Down to `(4, 1)` or Up to `(2, 1)` doesn't immediately lead to interacting with boxes or holes, while the Right move allows future movements closer to boxes located at `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`.\n\n### Decision:\nSince I need to look for meaningful interactions and further opportunities, I will move the avatar to the right.\n\n### Action Taken:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right to `(3, 2)` will keep more options available to push boxes while maintaining potential future interactions with holes.",
