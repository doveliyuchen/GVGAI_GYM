    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nThis game is essentially a puzzle game in the spirit of classic Sokoban titles. You control an avatar (a knight) who must move around a grid, pushing blocks (boxes) into certain target areas. In this case, the targets are \u201choles\u201d marked on the level. When a box is successfully pushed onto a hole, it transforms (changing its state and giving you some score bonus), and when conditions are right the box might convert back if it\u2019s moved off the hole. Your goal is to eliminate all boxes from the level (the win condition is that no boxes remain).\n\nKey points about the game:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Feel: It\u2019s a grid-based puzzle game where careful planning and moving pieces in tight spaces recalls the style of Sokoban puzzles.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 You move the \u201cavatar\u201d (shown as a knight) around the level, and the avatar can push boxes.\n\u2003\u2013 There are walls that block movement; if you try to move into one, your avatar steps back.\n\u2003\u2013 When boxes interact with other sprites or the environment (for instance, colliding with walls or the avatar in a certain way) sometimes special effects like bouncing or undoing moves occur.\n\u2003\u2013 A box landing on a hole transforms into a different state (\u201cboxin\u201d) and increases your score. However, if that transformed box then later touches \u201cground\u201d it turns back into a regular box and the score is reduced.\n\u2003 \n\u2022 Objective and Win Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your objective is to \u201cclear\u201d the level by making sure no boxes remain on the board.\n\u2003\u2013 To win, you must carefully maneuver each box so that it lands on a hole and stays there in its transformed state (avoiding accidental moves that would revert it back onto the floor).\n\u2003\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan your moves ahead. Since pushing a box improperly might leave it in a position where it might later roll off a hole onto the ground (forcing an undo or a score penalty), think through your path.\n\u2003\u2013 Aim to push each box steadily into a hole and try to block any chance for the boxin state to slide off. \n\u2003\u2013 Use walls and bounce mechanics to your advantage: sometimes hitting a wall might help reposition a box precisely.\n\u2003\u2013 Consider the order of moves. It\u2019s important to work in a sequence that prevents boxes from interfering with one another later in the level.\n\u2003\nIn summary, treat the game like a careful logistical puzzle. Each move needs to be calculated so that you can safely and permanently \u201cscore\u201d each box by landing it on a hole, eventually leaving no boxes behind and earning a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: GOOD \nFeedback: Action 3 moved the avatar from its previous safe position into a new safe ground tile, maintaining clear separation from any hazard. This slight repositioning may open up further opportunities for progress without increasing risk, yielding a reward of 0.0 from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> a\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> #\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```**box strategy: The avatar pushes boxes toward holes so they convert to boxin hole. By aligning each box with a nearby hole and using ground wall and box ground for stable support, batch-process boxes in each area to secure conversion without reversion. Without Alert since current progress is safe.**```",
