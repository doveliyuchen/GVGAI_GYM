    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and information, let\u2019s analyze the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fit within the **puzzle** genre, specifically reminiscent of **box-pushing** games like Sokoban. The player navigates a character (the avatar) around a grid-based layout to solve spatial challenges.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game features a few types of sprites, including immovable walls, a movable avatar (the player character), boxes, and holes where boxes can be transformed.\n- **Movements:** The avatar can move within the bounds of the grid, with restrictions on moving into walls. There is also a bouncing interaction when the avatar collides with the bounding box.\n- **Transformation:** When the player pushes a box into a hole, it transforms into a different state (boxin) and grants a score. Taking the transformed box back to the ground detracts from the score. \n- **Avatar Restriction:** The avatar cannot move through walls.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to manipulate the boxes within the game to clear them from the grid. Specifically, the goal is to reach a **SpriteCounter of type box** with a limit of **0** to win the game. This involves strategically placing boxes into holes to increase the score while also managing the boxes that need to be undone.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they manage to transform all boxes into the state represented by \u201cboxin\u201d with the resulting count being zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** While it\u2019s not explicitly outlined, failure can occur if the player is unable to move boxes into holes or if they become trapped without valid moves.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Initial Assessment:** Start by analyzing the layout of the boxes, holes, and walls. Identify where the boxes are currently located and how many boxes can potentially be moved.\n\n2. **Plan Moves:** Consider the sequence of moves to push boxes into holes. Start with the boxes closest to the holes since they can be transformed quickly, reducing the total count that needs to be dealt with.\n\n3. **Utilize Transformations Wisely:** Push boxes into holes to transform them as soon as possible. Keep track of the score changes to optimize the use of limited moves.\n\n4. **Keep Pathways Clear:** Make sure to keep pathways accessible. Avoid creating scenarios where the avatar cannot reach boxes or holes due to walls or other boxes.\n\n5. **Undo Mechanic:** Pay attention to the interactions with bbox and wall, as well as the undo mechanic. Use it strategically if you need to revert a decision that is leading to a dead-end.\n\n6. **Stay Flexible:** Be prepared to adjust your strategy as new interactions occur, especially if boxes are bouncing back or other unexpected transformations happen.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can work toward solving the grid efficiently and achieving the win condition while maximizing score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> a\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",

One of the boxes nearby is located at (4, 1), and I can push it either to the left or up to start placing boxes in holes.\n\nIf I move left and push the box, it can later be moved. \n\n### Decision:\nI will **move left** to position (4, 1) to push the box towards the hole at (3, 2) if the path remains clear afterward.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should allow me to either push the box toward a hole in the next move or reposition effectively. I expect to evaluate further moves after this action to clear boxes to meet the win condition.",
