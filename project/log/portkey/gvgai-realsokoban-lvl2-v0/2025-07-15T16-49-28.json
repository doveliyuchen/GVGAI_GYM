You control an avatar (a knight) who moves around a confined level, pushing objects (boxes) into specific spots.\n\u2003\u2013 The board is set in a maze-like grid where walls block your movement, and you have to think several moves ahead in order to push objects without trapping them.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics\n\u2003\u2013 Movement and Collision: The avatar moves around the level but can\u2019t pass through walls (they cause a \u201cstep back\u201d). The avatar and other objects have simple collision rules that may bounce or push other sprites.\n\u2003\u2013 Box Interactions: You encounter two kinds of box-like objects: \u201cbox\u201d and \u201cboxin.\u201d When you push a box over a hole (represented by a special dark blue sprite), it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d and you earn a point. However, if a \u201cboxin\u201d moves from a hole onto the ground, it reverts to a \u201cbox\u201d and you lose a point.\n\u2003\u2013 Other Interactions: There\u2019s an interaction between a \u201cbbox\u201d and the avatar that makes the avatar bounce forward, and an interaction involving \u201cbbox\u201d and walls that can undo several moves (suggesting that you must plan pushes carefully).\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: The win condition is met when all boxes have been cleared from the board. Specifically, the game checks that there are zero sprites of type \u201cbox\u201d remaining.\n\u2003\u2013 How to Clear Boxes: You\u2019re meant to push boxes into holes where they transform (into \u201cboxin\u201d), effectively removing them from the box count that is tracked for victory.\n\u2003\u2013 Risk: If you\u2019re not careful and let a \u201cboxin\u201d come into contact with the ground, it transforms back into a \u201cbox\u201d and subtracts from your progress (and score). This interplay means you have to keep each box securely on its hole until you finish the level.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy\n\u20031. Plan Your Moves: Like in Sokoban, every move needs to be thought out. Before pushing a box, consider if it will reach and stay on a hole or if it might inadvertently slide off.\n\u20032. Use Walls to Your Advantage: The walls not only structure the level but can help you control the momentum of the boxes. Make sure to push boxes against walls if that helps prevent them from moving off a hole.\n\u20033. Avoid Reversals: Keep in mind that pushing a box off a hole (which causes the reverse transformation and penalizes your score) is a setback. Try to work in an order that secures boxes in their correct positions without needing to undo your moves.\n\u20034. Manage Interactions With \u201cbbox\u201d: Although details are sparse, interactions involving bbox (which can bounce the avatar or trigger an undo) hint at extra environmental hazards or tools. Use these interactions carefully to avoid undoing progress.\n\u20035. Focus on the End Goal: Your primary goal is to eliminate all \u201cbox\u201d sprites by transforming them safely on holes. Keep this objective in mind while navigating the maze-like layout and pushing objects around.\n\nIn simple terms, you\u2019re leading a knight through a maze to push boxes into holes. When you get them in the right spot, they \u201clock in\u201d (transform), and once every box is in a hole (or transformed so that none remain as a box), you win the level. Stay mindful of your moves, plan ahead, and avoid risky pushes that might undo your progress.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.

Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> a\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",
