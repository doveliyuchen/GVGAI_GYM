Game Genre and Overall Feel:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a puzzle game that shares similarities with classic box\u2010pushing puzzles like Sokoban. The player moves an avatar around a grid-based level trying to manipulate objects (boxes) into designated goal areas (holes).\n\n2. Key Game Objects and Their Roles:\n\u2003\u2022 Avatar: The main character you control. It moves around the level but is prevented from walking into walls.\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes: Represented by the sprite \u201cbox\u201d (usually shown as \u201c*\u201d in the level). These are the objects that need to be manipulated.\n\u2003\u2022 Box-in: A transformed state of a box (sprite \u201cboxin\u201d) when a box successfully interacts with a hole. When this happens, you gain a score boost.\n\u2003\u2022 Holes: Represented by the symbol \u201co\u201d (and tied to the \u201chole\u201d sprite). When a box is pushed onto a hole, it transforms into boxin.\n\u2003\u2022 Walls/Floor/Other: The boundaries (walls) and floor pieces create the puzzle\u2019s maze, preventing or guiding movement.\n\n3. Game Mechanics and Interactions:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement & Collisions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The avatar can move around the grid, and colliding with walls causes it to step back.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There is also a \u201cbbox\u201d object which interacts with the avatar and walls; its collision makes the avatar \u201cbounce forward\u201d and seems to govern some momentum or undo mechanism.\n\u2003\u2022 Box-Hole Transformation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When a box (sprite \u201cbox\u201d) comes into contact with a hole, it is \u201ctransformed\u201d into a boxin (sprite \u201cboxin\u201d), with a score bonus (+1). This represents correctly placing a box.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 However, if the transformed box (boxin) then touches the ground, it reverts back to a regular box (score \u20131), which likely represents an accidental or undesired movement.\n\u2003\u2022 Special Undo Mechanism:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s an interaction where if a moving bounding box (\u201cbbox\u201d) hits a wall and another bbox simultaneously, then all actions are undone. This may be a built-in safety to prevent illegal moves or help with reset mechanics in multi-object interactions.\n\n4. Objective and Win Condition:\n\u2003\u2022 The ultimate goal is to eliminate all boxes from their \u201cbox\u201d state. The termination condition states that when the number of regular boxes reaches 0, you win.\n\u2003\u2022 In practical terms, you need to maneuver every box so that it gets transformed by interacting with a hole and stays as a boxin (since only \u201cbox\u201d sprites count toward the win counter).\n\n5. Overall Strategy Tips:\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Your Moves:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Think a few moves ahead. Since you need to keep boxes on holes without letting them revert by contacting the ground, be careful with your pushes.\n\u2003\u2022 Make Use of Walls and Corners:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The walls can help you position both you and the boxes. Use them to \u201clock\u201d boxes in a desirable position where they\u2019re less likely to accidentally hit ground and revert.\n\u2003\u2022 Secure the Boxes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 You want to get boxes onto holes, transform them into boxin, and then ensure that the boxin sprites don\u2019t inadvertently slide back onto a ground area (which would undo your progress).\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Unwanted Interactions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pay attention to the undo mechanism (involving bbox interactions) to avoid moves that might cancel out your progress.\n\u2003\u2022 Manage Score Changes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 You\u2019re rewarded (+1) for each box correctly transformed and punished (\u20131) if a boxin reverts. Keeping track of these changes might help you see if you\u2019re on a correct path.\n\nIn summary, this puzzle game requires careful planning and precise movements. You control an avatar whose job is to push boxes into holes to transform them, all while preventing them from sliding off (which would undo your work). Success lies in using the geometry of the level and the interactions with walls to safely \u201cset\u201d each box in its intended goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: GOOD \nFeedback: The upward move (Action 4) shifted the avatar from row 5 to row 4, placing it adjacent to the box. This improved positioning is strategically beneficial for future interactions with the puzzle elements, facilitating potential box pushes with no additional risk, yielding a reward of 0.0 from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> a\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```**avatar strategy: CURRENT CAPABILITY: The avatar can push box objects to interact with holes and trigger the transformation into boxin holes using the support of ground walls and floor holes. STRATEGIC CHOICE: Favor manipulating boxes by guiding them onto holes, as this conversion secures them and removes win-condition obstacles. EXECUTION PRINCIPLE: Batch-process boxes near holes by carefully pushing each box into a hole while using walls and floor holes to minimize accidental reversion; if progress stalls, switch symbol type priorities to reposition boxes more securely\u2014Alert**```",
