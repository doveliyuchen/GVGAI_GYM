    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game based on the rules provided.\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, a Sokoban-like puzzle)\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing Blocks:** The player (avatar) can likely push boxes around the level.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The player needs to plan moves to position boxes strategically.\n*   **Limited Movement:** The player is constrained by walls and boxes.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The player's goal is to eliminate all `box` sprites from the level\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The game is won when the number of `box` sprites equals zero (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`).\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   There are no explicit loss conditions mentioned, but it's highly probable that getting a box stuck in a corner or against a wall such that it can't be moved to a `hole` will make the level unsolvable, effectively resulting in a loss.\n\n**Sprite Roles:**\n\n*   `floor`, `ground`: These are likely the basic walkable surfaces. `ground` might represent the floor outside of the playing area.\n*   `hole`: The target location for the boxes.\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character.\n*   `bbox`: A passive sprite that seems to be involved in the `bounceForward` mechanic when interacting with the player\n*   `box`: The pushable crates/blocks that need to be moved into the holes.\n*   `boxin`: A block that has been placed into a hole.\n*   `wall`: Impassable barriers.\n\n**Interaction Analysis:**\n\n*   `avatar wall > stepBack`:  The player can't walk through walls; they are pushed back.\n*   `bbox avatar > bounceForward`: When the avatar interacts with the bbox, the avatar bounces forward.\n*   `bbox wall bbox > undoAll`: It seems that placing the bbox near a wall might undo a move.\n*   `box hole > transformTo stype=boxin scoreChange=1`: When a box is pushed into a hole, it transforms into a `boxin` sprite and the player gets a point.\n*   `boxin ground > transformTo stype=box scoreChange=-1`: When a boxin is pushed off of the ground, it reverts to a box sprite, and the score decreases by 1.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w` : Walls\n*   `.` : Floor\n*   `o` : Hole\n*   `*` : Box\n*   `A` : Avatar Start Position\n\nThe level is a small rectangular grid surrounded by walls. It contains the avatar, some boxes, and holes to push the boxes into.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban-style games require careful planning. Before making a move, consider the consequences. It's easy to get boxes stuck!\n2.  **Prioritize Cornered Boxes:** Focus on moving boxes that are near corners or walls first, as they have fewer movement options and are more likely to become stuck.\n3.  **Think in Reverse:** Sometimes, it helps to visualize the goal (all boxes in holes) and work backward to determine the necessary steps.\n4.  **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be mindful of creating situations where boxes are trapped and cannot be moved towards the holes.\n\nIn essence, this game is a Sokoban variant where the player pushes boxes into holes. Success relies on spatial reasoning, careful planning, and avoiding irreversible mistakes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> #\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",
