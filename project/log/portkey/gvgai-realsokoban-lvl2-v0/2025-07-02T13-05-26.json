    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, Sokoban-like)\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The core mechanic involves the avatar pushing boxes (`box`).\n*   **Transformations:** Boxes change state.  Pushing a `box` into a `hole` transforms it into `boxin` and scores points.  `boxin` on a `ground` transforms back to `box` and reduces points.\n*   **Movement Restrictions:** The avatar cannot pass through walls.  Something called `bbox` is also limiting avatar movement.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary goal is to get all the `box` sprites into `hole` sprites, transforming them into `boxin`.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** The player wins when the number of `box` sprites in the game is equal to 0 (presumably, because they have all been converted to `boxin`).\n\n**Sprites Analysis:**\n\n*   `floor`, `ground`: These seem to be the background tiles.\n*   `hole`:  The target destination for the boxes.\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character.\n*   `bbox`: Likely a \"bounding box\" used to detect collisions and prevent pushing multiple boxes at once or pushing into walls.\n*   `box`: The movable crates that the player needs to push.\n*   `boxin`: A \"boxed-in\" crate, the result of successfully placing a crate in a hole.\n*   `wall`: Impassable obstacles.\n\n**Interactions Analysis:**\n\n*   `avatar wall > stepBack`: Avatar cannot move into a wall.\n*   `bbox avatar  > bounceForward`: The avatar bounces off the bbox. This likely prevents the avatar from clipping into boxes.\n*   `bbox wall bbox   > undoAll`: If there are two bounding boxes surrounding a wall, the game resets. This is likely an error state.\n*   `box hole    > transformTo stype=boxin scoreChange=1`: Pushing a `box` into a `hole` transforms it into a `boxin` and gives the player 1 point.\n*   `boxin ground > transformTo stype=box scoreChange=-1`: Pushing a `boxin` onto a `ground` transforms it back into `box` and subtracts 1 point.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Represents walls.\n*   `.`: Represents floor tiles.\n*   `o`: Represents holes.\n*   `*`: Represents boxes.\n*   `A`: Represents the starting position of the avatar.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban-style games require careful planning.  Think several steps ahead to avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or blocking the holes.\n2.  **Prioritize Box Placement:** Focus on getting boxes into holes as efficiently as possible.\n3.  **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be extremely cautious about pushing a box into a position where it cannot be moved further, or where it blocks access to other boxes or holes.\n4.  **Utilize Walls:** Use walls to your advantage to control box movement and prevent them from sliding too far.\n5.  **Be Careful with Bounding Boxes:** Avoid creating error states where two bounding boxes are surrounding a wall.\n\nIn essence, this is a classic puzzle game about spatial reasoning and careful planning. The `bbox` sprite adds a layer of complexity to the movement and requires careful consideration.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> #\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",
