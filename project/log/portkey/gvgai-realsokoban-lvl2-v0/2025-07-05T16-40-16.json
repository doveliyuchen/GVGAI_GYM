The player needs to manipulate objects within a grid-based environment to achieve specific goals.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - Various sprites (floor, ground, hole, walls, boxes, and the avatar) play distinct roles in the game.\n   - The avatar represents the player-controlled character, which can move around the level.\n   - Boxes can be transformed between two types: normal boxes and special boxes (boxin), influencing the score based on their interactions with other sprites.\n   - Obstacles (walls) and interactive elements (holes) create a complex environment for the avatar to navigate.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can only move backward upon hitting walls, indicating limited movement options.\n   - Interactions between the avatar and other objects (bbox, which seems to be a type of box, and the wall) create dynamic responses, such as bouncing or undoing previous actions.\n   - The transformation of boxes into boxin upon interaction with a hole and vice versa creates a recycling mechanic that affects scoring and gameplay.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal appears to be to eliminate all boxes from the level. The win condition is met when the number of normal boxes (stype=box) reaches zero. The player may also earn points based on the transformations of boxes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins if they manage to eliminate all boxes (sprite counter for boxes hits zero).\n- There are no explicit loss conditions described, but the game's design suggests that moving incorrectly or getting stuck could lead to an unwinnable position.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Box Management:**\n   - Focus on how to maneuver boxes effectively towards holes. Since placing a box in a hole increases your score and transforms it, managing their placement is crucial.\n   - Attempt to cluster boxes close to holes to minimize movement time when interacting with them.\n\n2. **Avatar Movement:**\n   - Be mindful of wall interactions. Plan moves to avoid being pushed back unnecessarily, limiting effective movement around the level.\n   - Use any bounce-forward interactions strategically to propel boxes into desired positions.\n\n3. **Score Optimization:**\n   - While the primary objective is to clear the boxes, consider how many points you can earn while doing so. Placing boxes into holes could be used to your advantage before finalizing their removal.\n\n4. **Exploration:**\n   - Take time to explore the level layout before committing to moves. Observe how interacting with certain elements (like other boxes or the avatar) can create advantageous or detrimental situations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different box placements and interactions. Some moves might lead to unexpected outcomes that could help in future attempts to clear the level.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can efficiently navigate through challenges and work towards achieving the level's objective while earning the maximum score possible.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> a\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $",

    "content": "To achieve the objective of eliminating all boxes from the level, let's examine the current position of the avatar and the surrounding sprites. The avatar is currently located at (4, 2), surrounded by wall obstacles (which are located on (4, 1), (4, 3)). \n\nThe closest box is at (5, 1), to the south of the avatar. To align with the strategy of maximizing management of the boxes and aiming to place them into holes, I should move towards the box. \n\nSince I can only move down to (5, 2), let's execute that action.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action will take the avatar into the space (5, 2), allowing for a later interaction with the box at (5, 1) and keeping in mind the configuration of holes above. I expect to find a suitable position for further actions thereafter.",
