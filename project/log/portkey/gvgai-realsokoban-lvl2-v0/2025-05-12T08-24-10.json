Game Genre:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game with Sokoban-like elements. The player controls an avatar that pushes or interacts with objects in a constrained environment. The use of tiles (walls, floor, holes) and movable blocks is typical for puzzle challenges.\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement and Collision: The avatar moves around the grid, but colliding with walls makes it \u201cstepBack\u201d (i.e. it can\u2019t pass through obstacles). There is also an interaction where the avatar bouncing off a \u201cbbox\u201d causes a \u201cbounceForward\u201d \u2013 a mechanic that likely creates a controlled push effect.\n\u2003\u2022 Box Transformation: There are two types of block sprites\u2014\u201cbox\u201d and \u201cboxin\u201d. When a box meets a hole, it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d and gives a positive score. However, if a \u201cboxin\u201d is then on top of \u201cground\u201d, it transforms back to a box while decreasing the score. This means that the boxes do not simply vanish; they change state depending on where they are located.\n\u2003\u2022 Undo Interaction: An interaction labeled \u201cbbox wall bbox > undoAll\u201d suggests that if a box (or similar object represented by \u201cbbox\u201d) is in contact with a wall under certain conditions, the game might roll back recent moves. This introduces a puzzle element where each move must be carefully considered.\n\n3. Objective:\n\u2003\u2022 The explicit win condition is tied to the SpriteCounter for objects of stype \u201cbox\u201d. When the count of boxes reaches zero, the level is won. Practically, this means the player\u2019s goal is to remove every \u201cbox\u201d from play\u2014likely by transforming them into \u201cboxin\u201d where they no longer count as a box (keeping in mind that the boxes can revert if not handled properly).\n\n4. Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 Win Condition: The level is completed successfully once there are no \u201cbox\u201d sprites remaining.\n\u2003\u2022 Loss or Undesirable Outcomes: Although there isn\u2019t an explicit \u201closs\u201d condition mentioned, the risk lies in inadvertently causing a transformed block (\u201cboxin\u201d) to encounter the ground and revert to a \u201cbox\u201d. Also, if a player makes a move that must be undone (triggered by the \u201cundoAll\u201d interaction), that might signal that the current approach is leading to a dead end or unresolvable state.\n\n5. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Think Ahead: Like many puzzle games, careful planning is essential. Consider the consequences of each move, because pushing a box toward a hole will transform it, which is good, but if it later touches ground, it will revert.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the Environment: The placement of walls and holes is critical. Use walls to \u201clock in\u201d boxes that have been transformed so that they don\u2019t accidentally slide back onto the ground.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Unwanted Reversions: Once a box is transformed into a \u201cboxin\u201d, try to keep it on the hole or prevent further moves that might return it to a \u201cbox\u201d. This may involve positioning your avatar and other boxes carefully.\n\u2003\u2022 Take Advantage of Undo: The \u201cundoAll\u201d mechanism indicates that you might be able to reset problematic moves. Use this if you find yourself with boxes sliding off their targets.\n\u2003\u2022 Manage Score Changes: The score adjustments (gaining when on hole, losing when hitting ground) might not only be an extra incentive but also a signal for how \u201cgood\u201d a particular series of moves is. Aim to maximize transforming boxes on holes while avoiding penalties.\n\nThis blend of movement restrictions, state-changing blocks, and undo mechanics creates a challenging puzzle environment. The key is to remove all boxes by carefully positioning blocks on holes (and keeping them there), thus achieving the win condition while minimizing backtracking or unintended reversals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD \nFeedback: The downward move (action 4) shifted the avatar into a less optimal row, distancing it from the boxes and aligning it with a row that contains a hole. This move decreases the opportunity for effective pushes and fails to support progress toward solving the puzzle, keeping the reward at 0.0 from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> a\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```**avatar strategy: Leverage box-to-hole interactions by keeping the avatar near boxes so they can be pushed toward holes, transforming each box into a boxin hole. Simultaneously, prioritize using ground wall to lock in the boxin hole state in the central puzzle zone; batch-process all nearby boxes for transformation and security. If progress stalls or inefficient moves repeat, switch focus to emphasizing ground wall protection with **Alert****```",
