You control an avatar (a knight) in a confined level with walls, floors, holes, and boxes. The gameplay involves moving and pushing objects, and you must plan your moves to arrange them correctly.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics \u2013 You move the avatar around a grid-like level:\n\u2003\u2013 The avatar bounces back when running into walls.\n\u2003\u2013 You can push boxes around. When a box is pushed onto a hole, it automatically transforms (\u201cbox\u201d becomes \u201cboxin\u201d) and you get a score bonus.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s also an inverse process: if a \u201cboxin\u201d (the transformed box) ends up on a regular ground tile, it reverts to a \u201cbox\u201d and you lose that bonus.\n\u2003\u2013 Additional interactions (like a \u201cbbox\u201d colliding with the avatar or with walls) seem to produce effects like bouncing or even an \u201cundo\u201d action, which hints that some moves can automatically be canceled if you push objects into problematic positions.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win Condition \u2013 Your goal is to eliminate all ordinary boxes from the playfield. More precisely, the game keeps track of how many sprites of type \u201cbox\u201d remain, and you win when that count reaches 0. In other words, you want to have every box successfully transformed into its \u201cboxin\u201d form that sits on a hole (and does not get converted back by touching regular ground).\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy \u2013 Think of it like a careful block-pushing puzzle:\n\u20031. Plan Ahead: Survey the level layout and decide which boxes can be pushed into holes. You need to avoid accidentally pushing boxes away from holes where they\u2019re \u201cfixed\u201d in place.\n\u20032. Use the Environment: Walls and the layout of floors versus holes matter. Push the boxes in such a way that when they land on holes they stay there. Avoid any moves that would force a \u201cboxin\u201d off its secure spot onto open ground.\n\u20033. Manage Interactions: Be aware that wrong moves might trigger undo actions (such as when boxes hit walls under certain conditions), so use these mechanics to your advantage to experiment with moves without irreversible commitment.\n\u20034. Keep Score in Mind: Although the scoring isn\u2019t directly stated as a win/lose condition, the incremental score changes (gains when moving box to hole, losses when it reverts) suggest you need precision\u2014your goal is to \u201clock in\u201d your box transformations without losing progress.\n\nIn sum, treat the game as a puzzle where you must carefully push boxes into their \u201cdestination\u201d holes to permanently transform them, all while considering the reactive physics (bounce backs, undo actions) of the environment. Every move is about creating conditions that keep boxes safely on holes so that no ordinary boxes remain and you achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.
