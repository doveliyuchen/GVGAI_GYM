    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**: \nThe game appears to be a **puzzle action game**, potentially drawing inspiration from classic games like \"Bomberman.\" Players likely need to strategize the placement and timing of bombs to clear paths and defeat enemies.\n\n**Objective**: \nThe primary objective is to reach the **goal (green door)**, which earns the player points (score change of 10). To succeed, players must navigate through a maze, using bombs to remove obstacles and enemies without getting killed themselves.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n1. **Movement**: The player, represented by 'bomberman', can move through the maze and interact with walls, bomb sprites, and enemies.\n2. **Bombs**: Players can use various bombs (from bomb_10 to bomb_1) to destroy walls and enemies. Bombs have a cascading effect that creates explosions in multiple directions. Successfully using bombs will remove obstacles and defeat nearby enemies.\n3. **Enemies**: The game features NPC enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions) which can kill the player if colliding with them. Players must be strategic in avoiding them or using bombs to defeat them.\n4. **Scoring**: The player earns points for destroying enemies and walls, and loses when the bomberman is destroyed (score change of -5 for player death).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal while keeping at least one 'bomberman' sprite alive. \n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if all bomberman sprites are destroyed (limit reaches 0).\n\n### Possible Strategies\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to plan your moves effectively. Take note of the locations of walls, enemies, and the goal.\n  \n2. **Controlled Bomb Placement**: Use bombs strategically to clear pathways while ensuring you do not get caught in your own explosions. Place bombs near enemies to defeat them while keeping your distance.\n\n3. **Enemy Management**: Avoid direct contact with enemies. Instead, lure them into areas where you can use bombs to eliminate them. This will keep you safe while increasing your score.\n\n4. **Utilizing Explosions**: Position bombs to maximize chain reactions. For instance, placing a bomb near a wall or enemy can create explosions that affect multiple targets.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: Keep track of how many bombs you have left (if limited in number) and plan their usage wisely throughout the level.\n\n6. **Exploration**: Open up the maze by removing walls with bombs to find alternative routes to the goal. Always look for shortcuts to the goal that may be hidden behind walls.\n\n7. **Avoiding Tight Spots**: Be cautious not to corner yourself with walls or enemies. Keep a clear escape route when you set off bombs to prevent being caught in an explosion.\n\n8. **Score Maximization**: Aim to defeat enemies and destroy walls as much as possible to accumulate points while advancing to the goal, giving you a higher score overall.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, a player can effectively navigate through the challenges, maximize their score, and achieve the goal successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_8 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> %\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> %\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> j\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> d\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> %\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
