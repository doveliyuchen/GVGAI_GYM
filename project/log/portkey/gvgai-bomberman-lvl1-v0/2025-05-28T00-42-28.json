Players must navigate a grid-like space, strategically placing bombs to eliminate enemies and navigate towards an exit.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:** Key elements include:\n   - **Bomberman:** The player's avatar capable of placing bombs.\n   - **Enemies (Bat, Spider, Scorpion):** Random NPCs that pose a threat to the Bomberman; if they touch the Bomberman, the player loses.\n   - **Walls and Wall Breaks:** Impassable barriers that can be destroyed with bombs to create paths.\n   - **Bombs:** Placed by the Bomberman to eliminate enemies and obstacles.\n   - **Explosions:** Triggered by bombs affecting adjacent sprites (walls, enemies, etc.).\n   - **Goal (Green Door):** The exit which the player must reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions:** \n    - The Bomberman can place bombs and cause explosions that affect walls and enemies.\n    - Touching enemies or getting caught in explosions ends the game.\n    - Destroying enemies grants score points and can lead to spawning more bombs, allowing tactical advantages.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends in victory if the Bomberman reaches the goal (green door).\n   - The game ends in defeat if the Bomberman is eliminated (sprite count reaches 0).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to direct the Bomberman to the green door (exit) while avoiding elimination by enemies and explosions. A secondary objective is to maximize the score by strategically eliminating enemies.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win:** Reach the goal (green door) before losing all lives.\n- **Loss:** The Bomberman is killed either by enemies or by his own bomb explosions.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout to understand enemy placement and potential paths to the exit.\n\n2. **Strategic Bomb Placement:**\n   - Place bombs where they can destroy walls breaking pathways but avoid areas where the Bomberman might get trapped.\n   - Use bombs to clear enemies while maintaining a safe distance. Try to predict enemy movements to use bombs efficiently.\n\n3. **Timing and Movement:**\n   - Carefully time the placement of bombs to ensure that the Bomberman can escape the explosion radius. \n   - Constantly move to avoid enemy paths; staying on the move reduces the chance of getting surrounded.\n\n4. **Enemy Management:**\n   - Focus on destroying enemies one at a time to avoid multiple threats at once.\n   - Utilize the bomb spawn system to keep a supply of bombs for critical moments. \n\n5. **Escape Routes:** \n   - Always have an escape route planned in case an enemy gets too close.\n   - Be cautious when approaching areas with multiple enemies or walls that can be destructed; this could lead to bottlenecks.\n\n6. **Utilizing Wall Breaks:**\n   - If possible, predict when and where to break walls to maximize the train of explosions while keeping the Bomberman safe.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSuccess in this game hinges on the player's ability to adapt quickly, plan strategically, and maintain awareness of all the elements in the environment. Keeping an eye on enemy movements and controlling the battlefield with well-placed bombs will be essential to achieve the objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 bomb_8 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 bomb_7 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 bomb_6 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 bomb_5 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 bomb_4 -> 'h'\nbomb_3 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nbomb_2 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> #\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> j\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
