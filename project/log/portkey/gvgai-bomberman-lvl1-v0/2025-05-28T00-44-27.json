Game Genre:**\n- The game can be classified as an **action-puzzle game**. It incorporates elements of strategy due to the placement and timing of bombs, similar to games like *Bomberman*.\n\n**2. Mechanics:**\n- Players control a character (bomberman) that can place bombs.\n- The bombs can break walls and eliminate enemies, while creating explosions in specific directions (up, down, left, right).\n- There are enemy sprites (bats, spiders, scorpions) that move randomly within the environment.\n- The objective is to reach the goal (the green door) while strategically using bombs and avoiding enemies.\n- Different bomb types (bomb_1 to bomb_10) can be used, presumably with increasing power.\n- The interactions suggest that players can cause chain reactions with explosions, with walls and enemies affected by bomb placement.\n\n**3. Objective:**\n- The main objective is to reach the **goal** (green door) while maximizing the score by defeating enemies and breaking walls.\n- Players accumulate points by defeating enemies, reaching the goal, and potentially through chain reactions from bombs.\n\n**4. Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins if they reach the goal (green door).\n- The player loses if all bomberman sprites are destroyed (SpriteCounter limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Planning Bomb Placement:**\n   - Carefully consider where to place bombs. Positioning them to destroy walls effectively should open pathways while also targeting multiple enemies, creating chain reactions.\n   - Aim to place bombs where they can affect multiple segments of the level or enemy pathways.\n\n2. **Enemy Awareness:**\n   - Observe the enemies' movement patterns. Some enemies have cooldowns (like bats and spiders), which provides windows of opportunity to strike without getting hit.\n   - Focus on taking out tougher enemies first (like scorpions) to reduce the risk of losing the game.\n\n3. **Utilize Walls and Enemy Traps:**\n   - Use walls to your advantage. You can trap enemies in corridors with bomb placements, forcing them into explosion paths or keeping them away from the goal.\n\n4. **Avoiding Self-Destruction:**\n   - Be cautious not to get caught in your own bomb explosions. Timing is crucial; move away from bombs right after placing them to ensure your safety.\n\n5. **Maximize Score:**\n   - As you progress, ensure to defeat enemies when possible to boost your score. Always look for opportunities to chain-explode blocks and enemies for maximum score gain.\n\n6. **Level Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout as certain areas may require strategic bomb placements to navigate safely to the goal.\n   - Look for clusters of walls or multiple enemies grouped together, as these can yield high point scores when bombed effectively.\n\nBy following these strategies while keeping an eye on your surroundings and the enemy patterns, you can effectively navigate through the game and achieve the winning conditions while minimizing the risk of losing your character.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> %\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

The immediate surroundings show that there are walls ('&') and an enemy ('%') at (3, 8), while the goal ('$') is positioned at (6, 6).\n\nGiven the rules and strategy, I need to consider the following:\n\n1. There's a possibility to break down walls to create new paths toward the goal.\n2.

I need to maximize score while ensuring the safety of my avatar.\n\nSince the avatar has not moved since the last action, and considering the strategy not to face the enemy directly, I will place a bomb to break the wall blocking my potential route (which could also take out the enemy if the bomb positions correctly).\n\nTherefore, I'll use my action to place a bomb in the current position of my avatar to affect the wall and the enemy nearby.\n\n``` Action: ACTION_USE ```\n\nThis action aims to break a wall and potentially defeat the spider beside me, aligning with the strategy of using bombs effectively while maintaining a safe distance from enemies.",
