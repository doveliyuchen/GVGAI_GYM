The player likely needs to navigate through a maze-like environment, utilizing bombs strategically to defeat enemies and reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:  \n- The player controls a 'bomberman' character that can place bombs (represented by various bomb sprites) to achieve specific objectives. \n- The game features destructible walls and barriers, suggesting a strategic gameplay element where players must create paths and eliminate obstacles.\n- Enemies include bats, spiders, and scorpions that either move randomly or have specific behaviors, adding an element of challenge to the player\u2019s navigation and bomb placement.\n- Bombs can be placed in various locations and will explode, affecting surrounding sprites and objects in the environment.\n\n**Objectives**:  \n- The primary objective seems to be to reach the 'goal', designated by a green door, which grants victory.\n- Players must defeat enemies and navigate the environment without getting killed by either enemy attacks or their own bomb explosions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win Condition**: Reaching the goal door grants a score change and signifies victory.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably when the bomberman is killed, either by enemy contact or a bomb explosion (the sprite counter for the bomberman reaching zero denotes a loss).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Plan Bomb Placement**: Before placing bombs, consider their blast radius and the potential impact on both enemies and walls. Strategize to create paths towards the goal while eliminating threats.\n\n2. **Avoid Overlapping Explosions**: Be cautious not to place bombs too close to where you plan to move, as the player (bomberman) can also be harmed by explosions.\n\n3. **Utilize Destructible Walls**: Take advantage of destructible walls (wallBreak) to create new paths or to isolate enemies, making them easier targets for your bombing strategy.\n\n4. **Enemy Awareness**: Keep an eye on enemy movements. Plan your bombs to catch enemies in the blasts, and use their patterns to avoid unnecessary contact. \n\n5. **Manage Bomb Traffic**: Utilize the different bomb types effectively. Earlier-stage bombs can help clear the way for more powerful bombs as you progress. \n\n6. **Score Management**: Aim for maximum enemy kills to increase your score, as some gameplay mechanics reward you for defeating enemies. The destruction of walls and walls leading to enemies also contributes to the overall score.\n\n7. **Movement Strategy**: Stay mobile and observe enemy patterns to avoid being cornered. Create strategic retreats using walls and bomb placements to control the pace of the game.\n\n8. **Exploit Environmental Layout**: Use the layout of the maze to your advantage\u2014position yourself in areas where enemies can be lured into bomb explosions without being trapped.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can maximize effectiveness in navigating the maze, defeating enemies, and ultimately reaching the goal without facing elimination themselves.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nexplosionLeft -> 'j'\nbomb_3 bomb_9 -> 'k'\nbomb_2 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'l'\nbomb_1 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'm'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'n'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'o'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> o\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

The bomberman (represented by `#`) is located at position (3, 9) on the grid, and we have destructible walls indicated by `*` and the goal door represented by `$` located at (6, 6).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the situation:\n\n- **Current Position**: The bomberman is at (3, 9).\n- **Nearby Entities**:\n  - **Enemies**: There are bats (`@`) at (5, 3) and (5, 11) nearby, which may pose a threat.\n  - There are destructible walls near the bomberman, notably at (3, 3), (3, 5), and others which can be strategically used to navigate or destroy enemies.\n  - The goal (`$`) is several spaces away (down at row 6).\n \nGiven the available strategic options:\n- The bomberman needs to consider the potential threat from nearby bats and how to safely reach the goal which is two rows down from the current position.\n- There are a few destructible walls nearby that can be removed to create a path.\n\nTo initiate action, I will place a bomb at (3, 3) to eliminate that wall, allowing access to both potentially isolating enemies and creating an approach toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action places a bomb which aligns with the strategy to clear paths and eliminate threats, thus enabling progress toward the goal. I expect that this will start to reshape the game environment favorably for the bomberman.",
