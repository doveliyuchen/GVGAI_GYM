It combines navigation, destruction mechanics (via bombs), and enemy avoidance, hinting at strategic gameplay typical of older arcade-style games.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprite Interactions:**\n   - The main character, referred to as \"bomberman,\" can interact with walls, breakable walls, bombs, and enemies.\n   - Different types of bombs can spawn and trigger explosions that can damage or destroy walls and enemies.\n   - The objective includes navigating through a maze, using bombs to destroy walls or enemies, while avoiding being killed by explosions or enemy sprites.\n\n2. **Bomb Usage:**\n   - Bombs appear stationary but can be placed strategically to break walls or defeat enemies, and they cascade into explosions affecting adjacent sprites.\n   - The explosions can spread in multiple directions (up, down, left, right).\n\n3. **Enemies:** \n   - Multiple enemy types (bat, spider, scorpion) spawn periodically, adding a layer of complexity as they can kill the player upon contact.\n   - Bombs can also be used to eliminate these enemies, providing a dual utility.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- The player (bomberman) must navigate the level to reach the \"goal,\" represented by a green door, while collecting points by destroying enemies and walls.\n- The primary objective is to reach the goal before being killed, with points accumulated by managing bomb placements and enemy encounters effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- The player wins by reaching the goal (the green door) with at least one bomberman sprite alive.\n- The player loses if all bomberman sprites are killed.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the maze layout. Recognize sections where walls can be destroyed to create pathways and detour from enemies.\n\n2. **Bomb Placement:**\n   - Utilize bombs not just as weapons, but also as barriers, funneling enemies into tight spots where they can be blown up effectively.\n   - Always plan your bomb placement considering the potential explosion radius. Avoid placing bombs near your own path to prevent self-inflicted losses.\n\n3. **Enemy Management:**\n   - Observe enemy patterns and spawn timers\u2014this will help you predict their movements and place bombs accordingly.\n   - Destroy enemies as soon as you can without putting yourself at risk; prioritize taking them out when they are close together.\n\n4. **Resource Management:**\n   - Manage your access to bomb sprites carefully, ensuring that you are never left without resources to defend or maneuver.\n\n5. **Retreat and Adapt:**\n   - If you find yourself surrounded or low on health\u2014prioritize retreating to a safer area. Adapting your strategy based on enemy placements and your bomb supply is crucial for survival.\n\n6. **Utilize the Environment:**\n   - Use the walls and gaps strategically to block enemy movement while you set up your bombs for maximum effect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game challenges players to think strategically about environment interaction, enemy patterns, and bomb mechanics. Mastery of these elements will lead to successful navigation and completion of levels, achieving high scores along the way. Focus on tactical movement and bomb usage to enhance your gameplay experience.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> b\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> s\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> i\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> %\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
