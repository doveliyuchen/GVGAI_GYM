    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules of the game you've provided, here's a structured analysis:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game seems to fall under the **puzzle/action** genre, particularly reminiscent of games like \"Bomberman,\" where strategic placement and timing of bombs are essential to navigate the environment and defeat enemies.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites exist, including the player's avatar (`bomberman`), various enemies (`bat`, `spider`, `scorpion`), walls, bombs, and explosions.\n2. **Bombs**: The player can use bombs to destroy walls and enemies. There are multiple bomb types, suggesting a progression or increasing power.\n3. **Enemies**: Different enemy types introduce variety in strategic challenges, each with different cooldowns (time between movements or actions).\n4. **Explosions**: The bombs create chain reactions with their explosions, affecting the environment and enemies.\n5. **Goal**: The objective is to reach a 'goal' represented by a green door while potentially eliminating enemies along the way.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is to reach the goal sprite (the door) while managing bomb placement to navigate obstacles and defeat enemies. The player achieves victory by successfully reaching the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the `goal` sprite is reached.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the player's sprite (`bomberman`) is destroyed by an enemy, bomb explosion, or their own explosion.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Bomb Placement**: Start by identifying strategic locations for bomb placement. Use them to break through walls for access to pathways or to eliminate enemies in tight spaces.\n2. **Timing**: Timing is crucial; position yourself to safely detonate bombs without being caught in their blast radius.\n3. **Enemy Management**: Watch enemy movements and plan your actions accordingly. You may be able to lure enemies into the path of your bomb blasts or block their movements with walls you destroy.\n4. **Exploration**: Carefully explore the map to locate the goal while collecting bombs. Situational awareness will help mitigate risks from enemies and explosions.\n5. **Resource Management**: Since bomb resources seem to be limited and regenerate through certain mechanics (e.g., bomb spawning from 'background'), manage your bomb usage effectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis game appears to blend classic puzzle-solving with action elements, focusing on strategic bomb use to navigate towards an objective while avoiding threats. Players should focus on managing their environment, timing their actions, and effectively using bombs to maximize their chances of reaching the goal safely.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> %\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

    "content": "To decide on the next action, let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar (bomberman) is positioned at (3, 8).\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (represented by `$`) is at (6, 6).\n3. **Nearby Entities**:\n   - There are no immediate walls between the avatar and the goal.\n   - The closest threat is a bat at (3, 9) to the right and a spider below at (4, 6).\n   - There are walls at various points that can be navigated around.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions\n- The immediate objective is to reach the goal. The avatar can attempt to move toward (6, 6).\n- Before moving, it may be wise to assess the layout to see if bomb placement is necessary to eliminate threats (e.g., the spider) or barriers.\n- Since there are no immediate walls, I could move downwards toward (4, 8).\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven the immediate threat from the bat next to me, I must act strategically to avoid potential harm while moving toward the goal:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving down is a prudent choice to create distance from the bat, while positioning myself closer to maneuver toward the goal. I expect to continue progressing toward the goal, while keeping an eye on immediate threats.",
