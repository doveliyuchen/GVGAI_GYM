Each bomb spawns new bombs upon being placed on specific backgrounds.\n3. **Interactions**: Various interactions define how sprites respond to each other. For example, the bomberman can use bombs to kill enemies and break walls, while enemies can also kill the bomberman.\n4. **Goals**: The objective is to reach the 'goal' (a green door) while strategically using bombs to eliminate threats and navigate through the level.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe player's objective is to reach the goal located in the level while managing resources (bombs) and avoiding or defeating enemies. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the bomberman reaches the goal sprite, which awards a score change of 10.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the bomberman is killed, either by enemies or by his own explosions. The game ends when there are no remaining bombers.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify the position of walls, enemies, and the goal. Use this information to plan your movement and bomb placements.\n  \n2. **Resource Management**: Bombs are limited in number; use them wisely. Plan bomb placements to maximize area damage while ensuring they create pathways without trapping yourself.\n  \n3. **Trap Enemies**: Use bombs not just to destroy walls but also to create traps for enemies. For example, detonate a bomb near a wall to both eliminate the wall and any nearby enemies.\n  \n4. **Avoiding Self-Destruction**: Be cautious of your bomb placements, as they can injure the bomberman and lead to game loss. Always ensure you have a safe distance from your explosions.\n  \n5. **Sequential Bomb Usage**: Because bombs spawn additional bombs when they explode, carefully plan bomb sequences. This allows for chaining explosions that could clear multiple enemies or walls in one go.\n\n6. **Monitor Enemy Movements**: Observe enemy movement patterns with their cooldowns. Wait for the right moment to strike, especially when multiple enemies are nearby.\n\n7. **Explore before Engaging**: Before engaging enemies directly, explore to bomb breakable walls that could provide safe routes or more bombs. \n\nBy applying this strategic approach, players can navigate levels systematically, manage their assets effectively, and increase their chances of reaching the goal while avoiding annihilation.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nbomb_7 bomb_9 -> 'j'\nbomb_6 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'k'\nexplosionLeft -> 'l'\nbomb_5 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'm'\nbomb_4 bomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'n'\nbat spider -> 'o'\nbomb_3 bomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'p'\nbomb_2 bomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'q'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'r'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 't'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'u'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> %\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> u\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, I observe that the bomberman is located at (3, 9) and there are several destructible walls (`*`) and enemies (`@`) nearby. The goal represented by the green door (`$`) is located at (6, 6). My immediate task is to strategize a path towards the goal while managing the threats posed by the enemy and potential hazards from explosive interactions.\n\nFrom the available moves:\n\n1. **Move Up (to (2, 9))**: This brings me closer to potential bomb placements that could facilitate breaking down the walls above me while also avoiding the bat.\n2. **Move Down (to (4, 9))**: This would also keep me on the same level with potential bomb placements but doesn't progress towards the goal directly.\n3. **Use Bomb**: This could facilitate further movement if I choose strategic bomb placements in the direction of the goal.\n\nGiven the nearby bat located at (5, 11), I must be cautious and avoid unnecessary engagements that could lead to losing the game.\n\n### Action Analysis\nIf I move up to (2, 9), my positioning will allow for better strategic options in my next moves, especially considering there are bombs in the vicinity and the opportunity to clear walls while ensuring the bat remains unengaged.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action moves the bomberman up, positioning me to evaluate more options for strategic bomb placements while keeping the enemy at a distance. I expect this aligns with the strategy of optimizing map awareness and resource management while moving towards the goal.",
