    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, the game appears to be a strategic puzzle-adventure game with elements of action similar to classic titles like Bomberman. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the game's key components:\n\n### Game Genre:\n- **Puzzle/Action**: The gameplay involves solving spatial challenges with strategic placement and timing of bombs to defeat enemies and navigate through obstacles.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites are present that include:\n   - **Characters**: The player-controlled 'bomberman', enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions), and objectives (goal).\n   - **Obstacles**: Walls and breakable walls that can be destroyed using bombs.\n   - **Bombs and Explosions**: Players can deploy bombs that can cause explosions, affecting nearby sprites (enemies, walls).\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Players can interact with walls and walls that can be broken.\n   - Bombs can affect both the player and enemies.\n   - Enemies are killed by explosions, and defeating the goal awards points.\n   - There is also a risk to the player, since the bomberman can also get killed by their own explosions or by enemies.\n\n3. **Bombs**: The game features a mechanic where multiple bomb types are progressively spawned from lower-tier bombs, adding an element of resource management.\n\n### Objective:\n- The main goal of the game is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which awards points upon interaction. Additionally, players aim to maximize their score by defeating enemies and utilizing bombs effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the bomberman reaches the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the bomberman is killed (e.g., by an enemy or by their own bomb explosion).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level, including the locations of walls, breakable walls, and enemy spawn points.\n\n2. **Strategic Bomb Placement**:\n   - Use bombs to create pathways by breaking walls and to set traps for enemy NPCs.\n   - Be cautious of the bomb's blast radius; avoid placing bombs too close to yourself or where they can corner you.\n\n3. **Enemy Management**: \n   - Manipulate enemy movement by using bomb explosions to eliminate them at a safe distance.\n   - Plan your bomb placements so that explosions can chain and take out multiple enemies or walls at once.\n\n4. **Maximize Score**: Aim to defeat enemies and aim for the goal sprite after securing maximum safety and preparing escape routes.\n\n5. **Be Adaptable**: As enemies have varying cooldowns and spawn rates, adapt your strategies based on their movements and the bombs available.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can successfully navigate the challenges of the game, maximize their scores, and ultimately reach the goal before losing their bomberman character.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nbomb_4 bomb_9 -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_3 bomb_8 -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> k\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> j\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> %\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",
