    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **strategy/puzzle** genre, with elements reminiscent of games like **Bomberman**. Players must navigate a grid-based environment and use bombs strategically to defeat enemies and reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various elements within the game, including the player (bomberman), enemies (bat, spider, scorpion), walls, explosions, and bombs.\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The bomberman can place different kinds of bombs that can destroy walls and impact enemies.\n  - Enemies are random NPCs that may have cooldowns and do not attack directly but may retaliate or get affected by explosions.\n  - Players can score points by defeating enemies or reaching the goal.\n  - Bombs have various countdowns and effects. Inputs from the bomberman interact with tiles on the grid, leading to ways to either obliterate obstacles or enemies.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate through the maze-like level and reach the **goal** (the green door) while avoiding being killed by enemies or their explosions. The player aims to accumulate points through various actions including defeating enemies and breaking walls.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they reach the goal (sprite type 'goal') and it is destroyed (scoring 10 points).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the bomberman sprite is destroyed (sprite counter for bomberman reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Bomb Placement**: Carefully plan where to place bombs to maximize their effectiveness against enemies while also clearing pathways. Remember that bombs can affect walls, so use them wisely to open the path to the goal.\n2. **Enemy Management**: Observe the movement patterns and respawn rates of enemies like bats, spiders, and scorpions. Use your bombs to eliminate them when they cluster or are close to your path.\n3. **Avoiding Damage**: Keep a safe distance from bombs and enemies to avoid instant death from explosions.\n4. **Flow**: Maintain a practice of breaking walls to open up routes for escape and combat, but be mindful of how it could also affect your strategy\u2014like creating pathways that lead to enemies.\n5. **Score Maximization**: As you navigate toward the goal, look for ways to score additional points by defeating enemies and interacting with wall break sprites when possible.\n\nBy employing strategic bomb placement, managing enemy interactions, and navigating the level efficiently, players can achieve victory while also maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nspider -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwallBreak -> '*'\nbomb_9 -> 'b'\nbomb_8 -> 'g'\nbomb_7 -> 's'\nbomb_6 -> 'w'\nbomb_5 -> 'c'\nbomb_4 -> 'd'\nbomb_3 -> 'e'\nbomb_2 -> 'f'\nbomb_1 -> 'h'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'i'\nexplosionLeft -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=0, col=17 -> &\nrow=0, col=18 -> &\nrow=0, col=19 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=19 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> *\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> &\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> &\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> &\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> &\nrow=6, col=16 -> *\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> *\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> &\nrow=8, col=3 -> &\nrow=8, col=4 -> &\nrow=8, col=5 -> &\nrow=8, col=6 -> &\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=17 -> &\nrow=8, col=18 -> &\nrow=8, col=19 -> &",

    "content": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current state laid out before us:\n\n- The bomberman is at position (3, 9) indicated by the sprite `#`.\n- We have an enemy bat at (2, 1) and a spider at (1, 18), both of which are important because they can potentially harm us if positioned incorrectly.\n- There are also wall break tiles (`*`) and a target goal tile (`$`) which we should aim to reach for scoring points.\n  \n### Observations:\n- The goal is at (6, 6), and it's directly accessible if we can navigate through walls which we can likely break down using strategically placed bombs.\n- Our immediate surroundings (3, 9) provides some movement options where we could potentially move up to interact with a wall or place a bomb to break through walls surrounding the path towards the goal, while keeping an eye on the enemies.\n\n### Suggested action:\n1. **Bomb Placement Consideration**: The wall break tiles (`*`) provide potential areas where placing a bomb could help clear a path.\n2. **Enemy Awareness**: There are two enemies nearby, so we must take care not to rush into their vicinity without having a bomb ready.\n\nGiven the immediate surroundings, the most optimal approach would be to explore alternatives to destroy walls blocking the path to our goal while avoiding danger.\n\n### Decision:\nSince the avatar hasn't moved since the last state, I'll first rotate towards an open space before exploring further options. Thus, I will move Left.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to help reposition the bomberman towards the adjacent wall, gearing up either for a strategic bomb placement or continued movement towards the goal area.",
