The presence of walls, portals (goals), and destructible elements (catapult and bullets) suggests a focus on navigating levels, solving spatial challenges, and potentially strategy in timing and movement.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - Various immovable and movable sprites exist, including walls, water, catapults, and an avatar that navigates through the level.\n   - The avatar can face different directions, which likely impacts its movement and interactions within the game world.\n   - Bullets, walls, and goals also play significant roles in gameplay mechanics, with specific interactions causing transformations or consequences such as killing sprites or attracting gaze.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can face different directions which can change its state. It can interact with catapults, which can eliminate it, but also transform into directional orientations.\n   - Water is lethal for the moving sprite, suggesting hazards to avoid.\n   - The goal sprite denotes the endpoint for the level; reaching it is crucial.\n\n**Objective**: \nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal while avoiding interactions that would lead to the avatar\u2019s demise (e.g., getting killed by water or the catapult). Additionally, players need to manipulate the movement of the avatar carefully to avoid obstacles and potentially use projectiles to remove barriers.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if there are no remaining goal sprites (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Plan Movement Wisely**:\n   - Before making any moves, take a moment to analyze the layout and plan your route towards the goal while avoiding walls and dangerous water sections.\n\n2. **Use Directional Facing Strategically**:\n   - Employ the directional facing mechanic strategically to navigate through the level and position the avatar effectively for achieving goals or evading hazards.\n\n3. **Manage Catapult Engagement**:\n   - Be cautious when approaching the catapult, as engaging it could lead to your avatar's elimination. Ensure there are no immediate threats before interacting with it.\n\n4. **Take Advantage of Walls**:\n   - Use walls to protect your avatar from bullets and other hazards. If you encounter destructive bullets, look for ways to maneuver or counter them effectively.\n\n5. **Utilize the Water Hazard**:\n   - Depending on the level challenge, if you can lead other sprites (if applicable) into the water, use it strategically to clear obstacles or enemies.\n\nBy understanding these core mechanics and strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating through the game while aiming to reach the goal without losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
