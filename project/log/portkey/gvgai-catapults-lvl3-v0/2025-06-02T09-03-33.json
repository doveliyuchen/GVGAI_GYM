Players are likely navigating a level filled with obstacles, using interactive elements to achieve specific objectives while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites** represent various elements in the environment, including walls, water, a catapult, moving entities, and interaction points.\n- **Avatar** controls the main character, who can face in different directions, allowing for strategic movement throughout the level.\n- **Interactions** dictate how various sprites affect each other. For example, the avatar can transform based on direction, and bullets can interact with walls and moving objects.\n- **Goals and Hazards**: Players will need to avoid certain elements (like water that kills the sprite) while working toward reaching a goal represented by a \u2018goal\u2019 sprite. The avatar interacts with a catapult which can potentially lead to winning the game.\n\n#### Objectives\n- **Primary Objective**: The ultimate goal is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, which is a portal that signifies winning the game.\n- **Secondary Objectives**: Avoid getting killed by obstacles like water and manage movement using the catapult.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the player's avatar reaches the goal, as indicated by a SpriteCounter that tracks the number of remaining goal sprites.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the avatar is eliminated (when the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Understanding**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Since there are walls and water hazards, plan your path carefully to avoid dying.\n  \n2. **Movement Orientation**: Make use of the directional facing (north, south, east, west) to navigate effectively. Transform the avatar into the correct facing direction before proceeding to optimize movement.\n\n3. **Utilizing the Catapult**: Engage with the catapult strategically. Positioning your avatar within its range can lead to advantageous movement or interactions that bring you closer to the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Obstacles**: Keep an eye out for walls and water. The water is particularly dangerous and will eliminate the avatar, so navigate around it.\n\n5. **Plan Ahead**: Consider potential moves and how they could lead you to the goal while avoiding hazards. Create a mental map of your intended path and adapt when necessary.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, you should be able to navigate the level more effectively, leading to a successful approach to winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To determine the next action, we need to analyze the current state of the game and the layout of the map. However, the avatar's current position is not explicitly provided. \n\nBut from the layout, we can see various sprites and their configurations. There is a goal marked by `#` at (1, 1), and there are numerous water hazards represented by `*` particularly surrounding that area. \n\nMovement options are limited by walls (`&`), as well as the fact that if the avatar has previously attempted movement without changing its position, it may need to rotate. Since there's no indication of the avatar's prior action, we will need to ensure that the movement is towards the goal while avoiding the water.\n\n- The primary goal is to reach `#` at (1, 1).\n- The water hazards present significant risk.\n\nAssuming our avatar is positioned horizontally or vertically adjacent to this goal, our best action would be to attempt to move towards it while avoiding the water.\n\n1. If facing south or north and adjacent to (1,1), moving down (if necessary) or up would be the action.\n2. If facing east or west from an adjacent position, moving left or right might be applicable.\n\nGiven the context provided, if we already executed an action that didn't result in movement, let's take an action to navigate towards the goal. Therefore, I will take the action to move left, attempting to navigate towards the goal:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis should help in approaching the goal sprite and remaining aware of the surrounding obstacles and hazards.",
