    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules you provided, here's a detailed analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the **Puzzle/Strategy genre**, likely incorporating elements of action due to the interactions involving projectiles (bullets) and avatars.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** Various sprites represent different elements in the game, such as the floor, walls, water, catapults, avatars, bullets, and goals.\n- **Movement and Transformation:** The avatar can change direction (facing) and interact with sprites. Changing direction might be essential for navigation and completing the level.\n- **Interactivity:** The game has several interactions:\n  - **Bullets:** They can transform walls into moving elements and are lethal against players (avatars) if they come into contact with water.\n  - **Catapult:** Can trap or \"kill\" the avatar, providing a score change, implying it's a hazard or a strategic tool.\n  - **Goal Sprite:** Interacting with this sprite results in a \"kill\" action, which likely ends the game and determines winning criteria.\n  \n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding walls and water, and potentially utilizing the catapult effectively. Each level is designed with various environmental hazards (walls and water) and the ultimate goal is to reach the destination marked as the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no goal sprites remaining (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost when the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout. The presence of walls may create pathways and obstacles, so planning the avatar's route is critical.\n   \n2. **Control Directions:** Master the direction transformations (north, south, east, west) to effectively navigate the map, as each direction might present distinct movement opportunities.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Be conscious of the interactions with water and walls. Try to avoid sending the avatar into water or into positions where it may become stuck due to wall interactions.\n\n4. **Utilize the Catapult:** Consider the strategic placement of the catapult. It can either serve as an advantage to bypass certain obstacles or as a risk if not controlled effectively.\n\n5. **Plan Moves Ahead:** Always think one or two moves ahead. Predict the consequences of your interactions particularly with the goal and the avatar's position with respect to the walls and hazards.\n\n6. **Prioritize Goal Access:** Your primary focus should be on reaching the goal while ensuring that the avatar remains unharmed. \n\nBy implementing these strategies and understanding the level designs, players can successfully navigate the challenges of the game and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current game state and the layout provided, it seems that the avatar is likely located at a specific position where movement decisions must be made based on the interactions with the surrounding environment. \n\n### Analyzing the Game State\nFrom the map provided, walls (denoted by '&') surround most areas, while there are various sprite types including water ('*'), normal floor ('_'), and the goal ('#'). Assessing the best course of action is crucial:\n\n1. **Identify the Avatar's Position**: The position of the avatar is critical for deciding the next move. It should be on one of the defined sprite types.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Immediate Surroundings**: Look for potential movements either towards the goal (located at row 1, col 1) or paths that avoid hazards like water.\n\n3. **Determine if Action is Necessary**: If the avatar hasn't moved after the last action, a rotation might have occurred, thus necessitating a repeat direction action.\n\n### Next Steps\nAssuming the avatar's last action resulted in a failure to move (indicating perhaps a rotation) and knowing the goal location (1, 1), the strategy may involve moving the avatar closer to this goal, while considering any immediate hazards or walls.\n\nLet's choose an action to rotate towards the goal and then proceed based on our analysis. If the last action didn\u2019t change the avatar's position, I should evaluate to rotate and try to move towards the goal.\n\nBased on this reasoning and considering we're currently trying to get to the goal, I will issue the action to move `UP` towards the goal:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should rotate the avatar north and ideally move it closer to the goal (1, 1). I expect this aligns with our strategy to navigate towards the goal without intersecting hazards.",
