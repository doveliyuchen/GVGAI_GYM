    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer with elements of strategy and navigation, given the various sprite interactions and the goal-oriented nature of the environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Movement & Orientation:** The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west) and can be transformed into these orientations based on interactions with specific sprites.\n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can attract the gaze of a catapult and can be eliminated by it, which likely serves as an enemy or obstacle.\n  - The avatar is transformed into directional sprites based on player input (eastfacing, southfacing, etc.), suggesting navigation plays a significant role.\n  - There are walls that block movement but can be manipulated by bullets, adding layers to strategic movement.\n  - Water is lethal to the moving sprite, which encourages avoidance of certain areas.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which likely signifies winning the level.\n- The game incorporates score changes based on specific actions (e.g., avatars being killed by the catapult).\n- The player must manage the avatar carefully to avoid death (losing the avatar) while navigating towards the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins if the sprite counter for the 'goal' reaches zero, which indicates that the player has successfully reached or activated the goal.\n- The player loses if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, meaning the avatar has been eliminated.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Careful Navigation:** Use the directional sprites (north, south, east, west) strategically to navigate the level. Ensure to avoid water zones, as they will eliminate the avatar immediately.\n\n2. **Bullet Management:** While bullets interact with the walls and can turn them into moving sprites, avoid direct confrontations unless you are using them tactically to clear paths or create advantageous situations.\n\n3. **Awareness of Catapult:** Stay aware of the catapult's position and its ability to kill the avatar. Use it to your advantage to possibly clear pathways, but be cautious not to put the avatar in vulnerable positions.\n\n4. **Plan Routes Strategically:** Before making any move, plan a route towards the 'goal'. Map your intended direction and alternative paths to ensure successful navigation without getting trapped or eliminated.\n\n5. **Score vs. Survival:** While increasing the score by taking lethal actions can be tempting, prioritize survival first. Each avatar's elimination decreases your chances of completing the level.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics and interactions, players can develop a strategy to systematically approach and solve the puzzles presented in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
