Each sprite interacts differently based on predefined rules.\n2. **Movement:** The avatar can change orientations (north, south, east, west), likely allowing for dynamic movement.\n3. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with a catapult, which appears to be a primary mechanic for scoring.\n   - Water kills the avatar, suggesting a hazard to avoid.\n   - Bullets can transform walls, leading to further dynamic environmental changes.\n4. **Goals:** Reaching the goal sprite results in the avatar's removal, indicating victory.\n5. **Termination Conditions:** If there are no avatar sprites left (i.e., defeated), the game is lost; conversely, if the goal is reached, the game is won.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate through the environment, avoiding hazards (like water) and utilizing the catapult to score (by likely defeating other avatars within the game), ultimately reaching the goal to win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully navigating the level to the goal sprite while ensuring the avatar isn't eliminated.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar is defeated by hazards or failing to complete objectives (e.g., running out of avatars).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Movement Planning:** Prioritize safe paths and map out movements to avoid hazards like water. Players should look for spots where the avatar can safely maneuver and avoid getting \"killed\" by the water.\n  \n2. **Effective Use of Catapult:** Leverage the catapult efficiently to achieve objectives. Try to attract opponents or targets using the avatar to maximize scoring opportunities. \n\n3. **Control Orientation:** Since the avatar can change its direction, carefully consider the direction choices to navigate through the level efficiently while avoiding any walls or traps.\n\n4. **Beware of Transformations:** Understand the implications of bullet and wall interactions. Utilize bullets cautiously to avoid unintended consequences, such as losing the avatar through mishandling transformations.\n\n5. **Goal Focused:** Maintain a primary focus on reaching the goal while managing the state of the avatars and ensuring there's always an avatar available to interact with the catapult and execute plans.\n\nOverall, success in the game hinges on strategic movement, effective interaction with the game environment, and a focus on reaching the goal without losing all avatars.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
