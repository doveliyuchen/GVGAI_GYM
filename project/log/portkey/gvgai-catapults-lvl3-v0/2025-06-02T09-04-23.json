    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer, where players need to navigate through a map filled with obstacles to reach a goal while managing interactions with various sprites.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites have specific functionalities:\n   - **Floor**: Basic terrain.\n   - **Water**: A harmful tile that kills the avatar.\n   - **Catapult**: An object that interacts with the avatar to possibly launch it.\n   - **Directional Sprites (north/south/east/west facing)**: Control player direction.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that moves through the level.\n   - **Bullet**: Represents a projectile that interacts with walls and can affect other sprites.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the endpoint of the level, interaction leads to a win condition.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game includes several interactions between sprites:\n   - Players can control direction using the facing sprites.\n   - Collisions with the wall transform the bullet into a moving entity.\n   - Interactions with the catapult and goal lead to important game state changes (score change and win/loss).\n\n3. **Movement & Transformation**: The avatar can change direction based on player input, which is key to navigating the layout.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe player's primary objective is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding deaths from water and maneuvering through walls and other obstacles. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no more goal sprites left in the game (SpriteCounter limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when there are no avatars left, meaning the player character has died (SpriteCounter limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Take time to understand the layout thoroughly. Identify safe paths that avoid hazardous water and obstructions.\n\n2. **Utilize the Catapult**: The catapult seems to be a strategic asset; try to use it effectively to interact with the avatar. Understand if it can be manipulated to launch you towards the goal or to areas otherwise unreachable.\n\n3. **Manage Directional Movement**: Strategically use the directional sprites to ensure you are always moving towards the goal while avoiding walls and the water hazards.\n\n4. **Plan Moves with Precision**: Given the turn-based nature implied by some interactions, plan out your moves ahead of time to maximize safety while progressing towards the goal.\n\n5. **Assess Sprite Dynamics**: Recognize that the bullet can interact with the walls, which may help clear paths or create new movement options. Use these dynamics to your advantage.\n\n6. **Avoid Deaths**: Prioritize avoiding deadly water sections; losing the avatar will result in immediate failure, so carefully navigate around any water tiles.\n\nBy methodically navigating the levels, leveraging available mechanics like the catapult, and being attentive to hazards, players can achieve the main objective of reaching the goal while keeping their avatar safe.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state of the game grid, it looks like our avatar has not yet been specified with a position ('a' is missing), so I will assume the avatar could be at a common starting point.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the potential moves given the structure of the grid. The objective is to avoid water tiles while aiming towards the goal represented by the '#' sprite.\n\nBased on the provided map, the only goal '#', as seen at (1,1) is achievable, provided we can safely navigate through the water and other obstacles. \n\nSince there\u2019s no avatar position given explicitly, I will assume the avatar is somewhere safe and close to navigating towards the goal. The actions need to reflect avoiding water '*' immediately surrounding and taking safe pathways. \n\nGiven the context and the layout of the initial grid, choosing to move right should only be considered if it leads closer to the goal because of near hazards.\n\nIf the avatar starts near (for example) at (2,1), I will try to go left since that aligns with typical moves toward reaching a goal. If the avatar previously tried to move up or down and remained at the same spot, then left might not have been checked.\n\nTherefore, based on exploring changes and maintaining direction toward the goal, I will suggest:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis left action is centered around maneuvering away from obstacles and toward a potential safe pathway towards the goal. I expect this to set the avatar in a better position to advance toward the goal swiftly.",
