    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game appears to fit into the puzzle and action-adventure genre. Players likely need to solve spatial puzzles while evading hazards and potentially managing resources or enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites/Entities:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** Include walls, water, and the goal. These are static elements in the game environment.\n   - **Moving/Active Sprites:** Include the avatar, bullets, and catapults that interact with other sprites.\n   - **Orientations:** The avatar can face different directions, indicating it can move around the environment systematically.\n  \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - **Movement and Direction:** The avatar can change its facing direction, influencing movement through different walls and towards the goal.\n   - **Killing/Scoring Mechanisms:** Certain interactions (such as the catapult killing the avatar) affect the score and game state.\n   - **Bullet Interactions:** Bullets can transform walls and interact with sprite movement (e.g., moving into walls or dying when hitting water).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the green goal sprite. The game ends in victory when all goal sprites are collected (reaching a limit of 0 remaining goals). Losing occurs when the number of avatars equals 0, suggesting that if the avatar is removed or dies, the player loses.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** When the \"goal\" sprite count reaches zero, indicating successful completion of a task.\n- **Loss Condition:** When the \"avatar\" count reaches zero, which happens if the player\u2019s avatar is killed or removed from the game.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Familiarization:**\n   - Understand the layout of the level to locate the goal and avoid obstacles. Pay attention to walls as barriers and water as immediate hazards.\n\n2. **Directional Movement:**\n   - Utilize the avatar's ability to change orientation strategically to navigate toward the goal while avoiding threats. Plan movements to ensure safe passage.\n\n3. **Bullet Management:**\n   - Use bullets wisely to interact with walls\u2014transforming them when necessary to create paths or new routes.\n   - Avoid moving into water; stay mobile and aware of threats in the environment.\n\n4. **Scoring and Resource Management:**\n   - Keep track of the avatar count and the interaction with the catapult, as this may either earn score points or help in progressing in levels.\n   - Every action may affect the overall game state, so make calculated moves.\n\n5. **Incremental Goal Completion:**\n   - Since the number \"3,\" \"2,\" and \"0\" are present in the layout, strategize movement toward collectibles or goals that may provide supplementary objectives or help in reducing obstacles.\n\n6. **Survival Focus:**\n   - Prioritize keeping the avatar alive while maneuvering toward goals. Death results in losing the game, so risk assessment during navigation is key.\n\nBy following these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game mechanics and level layout, players can effectively advance through levels and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To analyze the provided game state, let's first locate the avatar and understand where it currently stands.\n\n### Avatar Location\n- Since the avatar ('a') is not explicitly marked in the map provided, we can safely assume the avatar could be located near positions with actionable floors (like '#', '@', '$', etc.).\n\n### Important Map Entities\n- The goal ('#') is located at (1, 1). \n- Several water hazards ('.', '*') exist, which the avatar should avoid.\n- Movable sprites ('$') appear to indicate some sort of interaction possible, found at (14, 8).\n- The layout contains walls ('&') that are impassable.\n\n### Strategy Recap\n- Our primary objective is to navigate to the goal at (1, 1).\n- We need to avoid taking unnecessary damage from moving hazards or potential pitfalls like water.\n\n### Current Movement\nGiven that no specific avatar movement direction has been described yet, it's essential to rotate or move towards open paths.\n\n### Next Action\n1. The available actions are moving to the left, right, down, or up. \n2. To reach the goal, the avatar should head towards (1, 1) ideally from a position nearby.\n\nGiven the context, the only apparent location near a wall or movement area needs assessment.\n\n### Choice of Action\n- Assuming the avatar is somewhere on the last row, a logical first move would typically be an upward action if that leads towards an open space.\n\nI will execute the action **up** (Action 4) to move the avatar towards a more advantageous position for identifying the next move towards the goal.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \nThis action should help me aim towards the goal efficiently while assessing further positions.",
