Players navigate a maze-like environment, using various sprites to interact with obstacles and achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Immovable Tiles**: Various immovable sprites like walls and water create obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character, which can change orientation and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Catapult**: An interactive element that can attract the avatar and possibly play a role in targeting or reaching goals.\n   - **Bullet**: Represents projectiles that can interact with walls and other elements.\n\n2. **Movement Orientation**:\n   - The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west) and can transform its orientation based on player's input.\n\n3. **Interactivity**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls (killing bullets), catapults (increasing score), and the goal (finishing the level).\n   - The environment includes dangerous tiles like water, which can \"kill\" the avatar if it attempts to traverse them.\n\n4. **Game Objectives**:\n   - The main objective is to navigate the avatar to the \u201cgoal\u201d sprite while avoiding obstacles and threats. The player also needs to manage interactions with the catapult and other sprites to progress.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Achieved when the number of goal sprites is reduced to 0 through interaction with the avatar.\n- **Loss Condition**: Triggered when the avatar's count reaches 0, likely representing that the avatar has been \"killed\".\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Movements**: Look ahead and plan your avatar\u2019s pathway to avoid walls and water sprites. Carefully consider how the avatar will be transformed based on its facing direction.\n\n2. **Utilize Catapults**: Use catapults strategically to attract the gaze and possibly maneuver around obstacles, ensuring that you can position your avatar correctly.\n\n3. **Manage Interactions**: Be aware of the state of sprites, particularly the interactions between bullets, walls, and water. Avoid moving into water tiles and manipulate the bullet interactions to clear your path.\n\n4. **Optimal Pathfinding**: Use the layout to find the most efficient route to the goal. This requires a mix of exploration and confrontation of obstacles while ensuring the avatar remains alive.\n\n5. **Exploit Sprite Transforms**: Make use of directional changes to navigate through the maze effectively and reach the goal, changing orientation only when necessary to avoid hazards.\n\nIn conclusion, this game combines puzzle-solving elements with strategic navigation, requiring players to think critically about interactions and movement within a designed space. Keeping track of sprite types and their interactions is crucial for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
