It may also involve elements of strategy and resource management due to the presence of a goal and obstacles.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites including immovable objects like walls and goals, as well as interactive elements such as the avatar, catapult, and bullets. \n2. **Movement and Transformations**: Players can change the direction of their avatar (north, south, east, west), which likely affects navigation and interaction with other sprites.\n3. **Interactions**: \n   - Bullets can transform walls or interact differently with water (resulting in sprite death).\n   - The avatar can interact with catapults, which appears to be a central mechanic for advancing through levels.\n   - The avatar can transition to four directions based on facing direction.\n   - If the avatar reaches the goal sprite, it results in a win condition.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe objective is to navigate the avatar to reach the goal sprite while avoiding hazards such as walls and water. Players need to interact strategically with catapults and bullets to achieve this goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the sprite counter for the goal sprite reaches zero, meaning the avatar has successfully reached the goal.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero, which likely means the avatar has been eliminated (either through interaction with a catapult or another hazard).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Understanding**: Analyze the level's layout carefully at the start. Identify locations of walls, water, and the goal.\n  \n2. **Utilize Catapults Wisely**: Since interacting with a catapult kills the avatar but also likely propels or aids in navigation, determine when and how to use it without losing your avatar immediately.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay away from water, as interacting with it will kill the avatar. Avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to a loss condition.\n\n4. **Direction Management**: Keep an eye on which direction your avatar is facing. Use directional transformations strategically to ensure you are navigating toward the goal.\n\n5. **Efficient Movement**: Aim to minimize moves by planning routes that require the least interaction with walls. Use the ability to face different directions to create paths and break obstacles.\n\n6. **Goal Proximity**: Always be aware of the goal sprite's proximity. After removing or dodging obstacles, quickly transition toward the goal to secure a win.\n\nThis strategic approach should equip players with the necessary tactics to navigate through levels effectively and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To decide on an action, let's first clarify the current state of the game based on the provided map structure. The important entities include:\n\n- **Goal sprite** at (1, 1) represented by '#'.\n- **Water** at various locations represented by '*', which is hazardous for the avatar 'a' and should be avoided.\n- **Walls** represented by '&', which block movement.\n- **Avatar current position is not specified directly**, but I will assume it is at (9, 9) based on the hint given by '@'.\n\nGiven these observations, let's outline our available routes towards the goal. The objective is to move the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards and walls. \n\n1. Identify possible moves from (9, 9):\n   - **Up (8, 9)**: Moving here will land on '*' (water), which is dangerous.\n   - **Down (10, 9)**: Moving here leads to '*' (water), which is also dangerous.\n   - **Left (9, 8)**: This space is occupied by a '%' (northfacing floor), which is viable.\n   - **Right (9, 10)**: This space is '.' (clear floor), which is also a viable move.\n\nSince moving up or down is dangerous due to water hazards, the best actions would be to consider left or right transitions. Choosing to move left puts you on a northfacing floor, which may help maneuver towards the goal.\n\nOverall, it is essential to change the avatar's direction first if necessary, assess the current situation, and then move to either route. \n\nI suggest taking the initial move to the left which is not hazardous. \n\nThus, I will proceed with: \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow us to safely change the avatar's position while avoiding immediate threats and planning the next move towards the goal.",
