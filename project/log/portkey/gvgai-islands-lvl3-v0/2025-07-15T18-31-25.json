Players use their avatar to interact with various sprites to solve challenges, collect resources, and reach goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features a variety of sprites, including impassable walls (EOS), resources (like sand), enemies (like fire), obstacles (like whirlpools), and collectible rewards (like treasure).\n   \n2. **Interactions**: The player can:\n   - Collect sand by interacting with it, which is essential to progress.\n   - Use a shovel to manipulate the environment (e.g., creating sand).\n   - Avoid or extinguish fire through strategic interactions with water.\n   - Navigate through whirlpools and avoid death through interactions with fire and other hazards.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: Sand is a crucial resource for certain actions (like creating new sand with a shovel) and has limits that the player must manage.\n\n4. **Goals**: The avatar must ultimately reach the goal sprite to win, while also collecting treasures for additional points along the way.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal while managing resources effectively, avoiding hazards, and accumulating points by collecting treasures.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if the goal sprite is reached (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Lose**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0) or if the time runs out (Timeout limit=1000).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Gathering**: Start by gathering sand. Collect sand whenever possible since it is required to create new land and necessary for using the shovel effectively.\n\n2. **Environmental Manipulation**: Use the shovel on land to spawn sand efficiently. Plan your moves around collecting sand to ensure you have enough for the shovel to perform actions.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of fire and whirlpools. If you encounter fire, try to extinguish it by using water when possible, as interacting with fire usually results in the avatar being killed.\n\n4. **Maximize Point Scoring**: Collect treasures whenever they are encountered, as each one improves your score significantly (scoreChange=100).\n\n5. **Plan Your Route**: Analyzing the level layout is crucial. Prioritize paths that lead you towards the goal while also allowing for the collection of sand and treasure. Take note of walls and other impenetrable barriers (like whirlpools) that could block your path.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer, ensuring you make efficient choices so that you don\u2019t run out of time to reach the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies while keeping an eye on your resources and navigating the level layout carefully, you will enhance your chances of successfully completing the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater -> '.'\nlandSand -> 'x'\nwater bomb -> 'b'\nwater whirlpool -> 'p'\nlandSand treasure -> 't'\nlandSand goal -> 'g'\nbomb water -> '@'\ngoal landSand -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> p\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> x\nrow=0, col=11 -> #\nrow=0, col=12 -> x\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> x\nrow=2, col=3 -> x\nrow=2, col=4 -> x\nrow=2, col=5 -> x\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> p\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=0 -> .\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> x\nrow=4, col=9 -> x\nrow=4, col=10 -> x\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=0 -> .\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> x\nrow=6, col=4 -> x\nrow=6, col=5 -> x\nrow=6, col=6 -> x\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> p\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=0 -> .\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> x\nrow=7, col=13 -> x\nrow=7, col=14 -> x\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> x\nrow=8, col=3 -> t\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> p\nrow=8, col=8 -> p\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> a\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=0 -> .\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .",
