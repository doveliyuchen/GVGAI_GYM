The presence of walls, traps, and strategic movement indicates a need for problem-solving skills.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n- The player controls an avatar that can navigate through a level consisting of walls, traps, and exits.\n- There are various interactable sprites, including normal walls, colored walls (red and blue), resources (redcoat and bluecoat), traps, and an exit.\n- The avatar can interact with colored coats to transform into different avatars, each potentially having unique attributes.\n- The game employs a scoring system wherein players gain or lose points based on actions. For example, entering the exit yields points, while hitting a trap results in a loss.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe main objective is to reach the exit while avoiding traps and navigating around walls. Transforming into different avatars through the use of coats may play a significant role in progressing through the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- The game is won when the player avatar reaches the exit, with a SpriteCounter indicating that the exit sprite count has reached zero.\n- The player loses if their avatar count reaches zero, indicating that they have failed in terms of life management.\n- There is also a timeout condition that leads to loss if not completed within 1,000 game ticks.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Understand the Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the layout by observing the level. Identify where walls and traps are located relative to the exit to plan your route.\n\n2. **Use Transformations Wisely**: Prioritize collecting the redcoat and bluecoat, as transforming may provide benefits, such as accessing different areas or avoiding traps. Assess when it is best to switch to maximize your score and survivability.\n\n3. **Avoid Traps**: Be cautious about where you step, as traps will deduct points and potentially lead to losing the avatar. Move methodically and avoid risky areas unless necessary.\n\n4. **Plan Movement**: Don't rush through the level. Take time to plan each move, especially near walls where the avatar may step back or encounter barriers.\n\n5. **Keep Track of Time**: With a timeout condition in play, keep an eye on the game's ticking clock. Ensure you don't take too long to reach the exit.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Aim to maximize your score through efficient actions\u2014collect coats, navigate efficiently, and reach the exit. Weigh the cost of transformations against the benefits they provide.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the levels, optimize their performance, and achieve the overall goal of exiting the level successfully. Monitor interactions closely and adjust tactics based on the evolving game state!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nblueWall -> '@'\nbluecoat -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nnormalWall -> '%'\nredWall -> '&'\nredcoat -> '*'\ntrap -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> &\nrow=1, col=8 -> &\nrow=1, col=9 -> &\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> %\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=15 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> &\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> %\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> %\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> %\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> %\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=15 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=11, col=0 -> %\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> %\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> %\nrow=11, col=5 -> %\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> %\nrow=11, col=8 -> %\nrow=11, col=9 -> %\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> %\nrow=11, col=12 -> %\nrow=11, col=13 -> %\nrow=11, col=14 -> %\nrow=11, col=15 -> %\nrow=12, col=0 -> %\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> %\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> b\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> #\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> %\nrow=13, col=0 -> %\nrow=13, col=1 -> %\nrow=13, col=2 -> %\nrow=13, col=3 -> %\nrow=13, col=4 -> %\nrow=13, col=5 -> %\nrow=13, col=6 -> %\nrow=13, col=7 -> %\nrow=13, col=8 -> %\nrow=13, col=9 -> %\nrow=13, col=10 -> %\nrow=13, col=11 -> %\nrow=13, col=12 -> %\nrow=13, col=13 -> %\nrow=13, col=14 -> %\nrow=13, col=15 -> %",

    "content": "The current state of the game shows that my avatar is surrounded by several walls and a few interactable elements. Notably, there are certain colored avatars, traps, and an exit to reach. My immediate goal is to avoid traps, collect coats to transform, and eventually reach the exit located at (row 1, col 14).\n\nSince the avatar can only potentially move, and based on the observation, I will proceed with an action. Given that the exit is positioned quite a distance away and there are walls to navigate around, it's necessary first to check the potential maneuvering.\n\nLet's examine available movement options:\n\n1. Moving **UP** (0, col) keeps me still at row 0 (though it may not apply as the full row appears as walls).\n2. Moving **LEFT** (row, -1 col) may not be viable since there is a wall to the left at (row 1, col 1).\n3. Moving **RIGHT** (row, +1 col) to (row 1, col 4) may find an exit further down.\n4. Moving **DOWN** (row +1, col) stays within parameters of the walls; regular actions should be considered.\n\nCurrently, there seems to be an availability to the right towards (row 1, col 4) in a straight path. Thus, I will choose to move to the right.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right appears to provide openings towards the exit while avoiding any traps for now, consistent with the strategy of careful exploration and scoring management.",
