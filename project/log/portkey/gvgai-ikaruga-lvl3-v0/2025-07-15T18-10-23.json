Each of these has specific roles and interactions, creating a dynamic environment for the player.\n- **Interactions**: Different types of interaction between the player and other sprites result in actions such as killing, transforming, and stepping back. This suggests a tactical approach to engagements, where players will need to be mindful of what they are interacting with.\n- **Cool Downs and Spawn Mechanic**: The game includes cooldown timers for certain actions (like firing missiles or spawning aliens), which introduces a layer of strategic timing.\n\n### Objective:\n- The primary objective appears to be to eliminate all portals and aliens within the game while managing and preserving your avatar. The win condition is activated when there are no portals or aliens remaining.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Achieved by eliminating all of the portals and aliens in the game (indicated by the condition: `MultiSpriteCounter stype1=portal stype2=alien limit=0 win=True`).\n- **Loss Condition**: If the player\u2019s avatar sprite counter reaches zero, the game is lost (indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Movement & Positioning**: Stay mobile and avoid corners or any fixed positions to reduce risk from enemy attacks. The ability to step back from walls and the end of screen (EOS) indicates the importance of utilizing space effectively.\n\n2. **Bullet Management**: Be cognitive of the bullet types; using the right bullets against specific aliens can lead to extra score advantages (e.g., the black bullet kills the black alien while also increasing score). \n\n3. **Use of Changers Wisely**: The changers allow for transformations within the avatars. Crafty players may strategically use black and white changers to keep their avatar safe or to switch to the more advantageous avatar type based on the current scenario.\n\n4. **Portal Control**: Since portals spawn aliens, focusing on destroying portals first will limit the number of enemies you need to deal with, allowing you to manage your resources better.\n\n5. **Call for Patience**: Given enemy cooldowns, staying alive while they are spawning before countering can be critical. Time your attacks to maximize damage when they are vulnerable.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Being aware of the consequences of interactions (score change) is crucial \u2013 avoid attacks that could lead to a loss of score and focus on productive engagements.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can navigate the game effectively, maximizing their chances of victory while minimizing potential losses. Ultimately, awareness of the game mechanics and strategic thinking will be key to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwall background -> 'o'\nwhitePortal1 background -> 'q'\nblackPortal1 background -> 'w'\nwhitePortal2 background -> 'e'\nblackPortal2 background -> 'r'\nwhiteAvatar background -> 'A'\nwChangerPortal background -> 'z'\nbChangerPortal background -> 'x'\nbackground -> '.'\nblackAlien -> '@'\nblackChanger -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nwhiteAlien -> '%'\nwhiteAvatar -> '&'\nwhiteChanger -> '*'\nblackChanger whiteAlien -> 'b'\nwhiteAlien whiteChanger -> 'c'\nblackAlien bomb -> 'd'\nbomb -> 'f'\nbomb whiteAlien -> 'g'\nwhiteAvatar whiteBullet -> 'h'\nwhiteBullet -> 'i'\nblackAlien whiteAlien -> 'j'\nwhiteAvatar whiteChanger -> 'k'\nblackAlien whiteBullet -> 'l'\nblackAlien bomb whiteAlien -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> %\nrow=1, col=5 -> %\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> %\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> %\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> %\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> %\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> @\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> @\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> %\nrow=9, col=4 -> @\nrow=9, col=5 -> @\nrow=9, col=6 -> %\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> %\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> m\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> j\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> %\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> %\nrow=11, col=5 -> %\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> g\nrow=11, col=8 -> @\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> %\nrow=12, col=2 -> @\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> @\nrow=12, col=5 -> @\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> %\nrow=12, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> %\nrow=13, col=2 -> @\nrow=13, col=3 -> .\nrow=13, col=4 -> @\nrow=13, col=5 -> @\nrow=13, col=6 -> .\nrow=13, col=7 -> @\nrow=13, col=8 -> %\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=14, col=0 -> $\nrow=14, col=1 -> @\nrow=14, col=2 -> %\nrow=14, col=3 -> @\nrow=14, col=4 -> .\nrow=14, col=5 -> %\nrow=14, col=6 -> @\nrow=14, col=7 -> %\nrow=14, col=8 -> @\nrow=14, col=9 -> $\nrow=15, col=0 -> $\nrow=15, col=1 -> @\nrow=15, col=2 -> %\nrow=15, col=3 -> @\nrow=15, col=4 -> .\nrow=15, col=5 -> %\nrow=15, col=6 -> @\nrow=15, col=7 -> %\nrow=15, col=8 -> @\nrow=15, col=9 -> $\nrow=16, col=0 -> $\nrow=16, col=1 -> %\nrow=16, col=2 -> @\nrow=16, col=3 -> .\nrow=16, col=4 -> @\nrow=16, col=5 -> @\nrow=16, col=6 -> .\nrow=16, col=7 -> @\nrow=16, col=8 -> %\nrow=16, col=9 -> $\nrow=17, col=0 -> $\nrow=17, col=1 -> %\nrow=17, col=2 -> @\nrow=17, col=3 -> %\nrow=17, col=4 -> @\nrow=17, col=5 -> @\nrow=17, col=6 -> %\nrow=17, col=7 -> @\nrow=17, col=8 -> %\nrow=17, col=9 -> $\nrow=18, col=0 -> $\nrow=18, col=1 -> .\nrow=18, col=2 -> &\nrow=18, col=3 -> %\nrow=18, col=4 -> .\nrow=18, col=5 -> .\nrow=18, col=6 -> %\nrow=18, col=7 -> .\nrow=18, col=8 -> %\nrow=18, col=9 -> $",

The immediate surroundings include walls denoted by '$', and various enemy types including black aliens ('@') and white aliens ('%'). The situation shows substantial coverage of black aliens nearby, particularly in column 2.\n\nSince the avatar's last position hasn't changed and based on general strategy, movement is crucial to avoid being cornered or targeted by the enemies' projectiles. The primary strategic action would be to shift my position horizontally to assess the situation better and avoid unnecessary damage. \n\nThe first action, therefore, should be moving either left or right. Given that moving left (to (18, 1)) would bring the avatar closer to walls, a safer option would be moving right to (18, 3) as it remains open and creates an opportunity for future moves.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nBy moving right, I expect to gain better positioning and evade any potential threats from black aliens while maintaining the ability to engage with the white aliens and continue progressing towards the main objective of eliminating portals and aliens.",
