    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fall under the category of **puzzle-platformer**, with elements of strategy and spatial reasoning. Players navigate through a maze-like layout, which requires them to manipulate their environment to reach specific goals.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as walls, water, a goal, an avatar, a catapult, and bullets. Each sprite has distinct interactions and behaviors.\n  \n2. **Movement and Transformation**: The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west), and based on its orientation, it can transform into respective directional sprites. This is crucial for navigating the environment.\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - **Catapult and Avatar**: When the avatar interacts with the catapult, it is marked for \"kill\" while awarding points, suggesting the catapult is a mechanism for launching the avatar.\n   - **Walls and Bullets**: Interacting with walls transforms the bullet into a moving entity. If the moving entity hits water, it's eliminated.\n   - **Water Hazards**: Interacting with water kills the moving avatar, implying it\u2019s a hazard.\n\n4. **Goal**: The game\u2019s objective is reached when the avatar interacts with the goal sprite, leading to a win condition. The game ends negatively if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero.\n\n### Objectives\nThe player\u2019s main objectives are:\n- Navigate through obstacles, avoiding hazards such as walls and especially water.\n- Use the catapult effectively to navigate over walls or reach the goal.\n- Reach the goal (green sprite) to win the game, ensuring the avatar exists throughout.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (indicating the avatar has reached the goal).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (indicative of the avatar being eliminated).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay away from water areas to avoid losing the avatar. Plan routes that don't expose the avatar to hazards.\n\n2. **Utilize Catapults**: Identify and make strategic use of catapults to propel the avatar over walls and closer to the goal, as they provide a critical advantage.\n\n3. **Directional Orientation**: Pay close attention to the avatar's orientation to ensure correct transformations into directional sprites to navigate the environment effectively.\n\n4. **Map Awareness**: Be aware of the layout and the location of obstacles. Strategically plan moves while considering where walls, goals, and hazards are.\n\n5. **Iterative Learning**: If you fail, analyze what went wrong, particularly in terms of interactions and movements. Learn from each attempt to enhance strategy on subsequent tries.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game and increase their chances of success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
