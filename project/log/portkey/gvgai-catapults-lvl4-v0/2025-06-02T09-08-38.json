    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout description, here is an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fall into the puzzle platformer genre. The player navigates a character (the \"avatar\") through a series of obstacles and challenges, making strategic decisions to achieve a specific objective.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites are used, including walls, water, catapults, and a goal. Each sprite has specific interactions, such as walls blocking movement, water causing death if touched, and a goal that the player must reach.\n- **Movement and Orientation**: The player can change the orientation of the avatar (north, south, east, west).\n- **Interactions**: There are interactive mechanics where bullets can destroy walls, the avatar can attract gaze from catapults, and specific movements can result in defeating the avatar.\n- **Bullet and Moving Mechanics**: The presence of projectiles (bullets) suggests a shooting mechanic, while 'moving' implies the avatar can change state based on surroundings (possibly using bullets against walls).\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the goal, which is marked by a specific sprite. As indicated by the termination conditions, the player wins the game if all goal sprites are reached (SpriteCounter = 0) before the avatar is killed.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach all goal sprites, resulting in a total SpriteCounter of 0 for the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the level layout carefully to understand potential paths to the goal while avoiding traps (like water).\n2. **Utilize Bullets Wisely**: Use the bullets effectively against walls to create paths. If an area is blocked by walls, determining where you can shoot will be critical for progression.\n3. **Change Orientation**: Strategically change the avatar's orientation to avoid catapults and navigate around obstacles efficiently.\n4. **Stay Away from Water**: Avoid moving into water zones where the avatar can be killed instantly. Planning movements carefully will help maintain the avatar\u2019s safety.\n5. **Plan for Catapults**: Use the interaction with catapults intentionally, as they seem to attract the gaze. Understand their placement and how they might affect your movement towards the goal.\n6. **Reach Multiple Goals**: Since there may be multiple goal sprites present, prioritize routes that enable movement towards several goals in one path where possible.\n\nBy applying these strategies and understanding the mechanics of interaction, the player can effectively navigate through the levels and achieve the objective of reaching the goal while preserving the avatar's life.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state of the map, it appears that the avatar's last known position is not explicitly stated. Based on the provided map, I need to determine the best next action to guide the avatar towards the goal while avoiding obstacles like water and walls.\n\nFirst, let's identify the potential moves of the avatar. \n\n### Observations:\n- The goal sprite ('g') is located at (3, 13) and also at (9, 1) and (14, 9).\n- The avatar can only move onto non-water tiles ('.', '0', '1', '2', 'A', '_').\n- There are walls located at various points, indicated by '*' that block movement.\n- Avoid water ('.' and 'e'), as they will kill the avatar.\n\n### Strategy Application:\n1. Assuming that the avatar is near a goal sprite, I will first presuppose that the avatar is able to move left, right, up, or down accordingly to navigate toward one of the goal sprites.\n\n2. I will take into account that if the avatar is currently facing a wall or water, we need to rotate towards an empty space or goal.\n\n3. Assuming the current avatar position is at (3, 14) (as the only path towards (3, 13) is blocked and the (3, 15) is a wall), the most logical action next would be to move left to (3, 13).\n\n### Action Selection:\nThus, since the avatar can only aim to move left without encountering water or any walls, the most effective action here would be:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\n**Feedback:** This action is expected to bring us towards the goal sprite located at (3, 13), thereby making progress towards the objective.",
