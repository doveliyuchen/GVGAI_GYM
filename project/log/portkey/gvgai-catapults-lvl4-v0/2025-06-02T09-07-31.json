    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of strategy and resource management. Players navigate through a grid-based environment to overcome obstacles and reach specific goals.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites (objects) including:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Floor, walls, water, and goals.\n   - **Player Objects**: Avatar (player character), catapult, and directional indicators (north, south, east, west).\n   - **Projectiles**: Bullets that can interact with walls.\n   \n2. **Movement and Transformation**:\n   - The player (avatar) can change orientation and transform into directional sprites (north, south, east, west).\n   - There are mechanics for interacting with different sprites (e.g., bullets can transform walls into moving sprites).\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with the catapult to gain attention or take actions that can change game states.\n   - Specific rules determine how different sprites interact, such as how water kills moving sprites, and how avatars can be transformed based on direction.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the **goal sprite (green door)** while ensuring that the **avatar** remains on the board. The player must avoid losing the avatar, which would result in a loss condition.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (indicating the avatar has potentially reached the goal).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the avatar sprite counter reaches zero (meaning the avatar is eliminated).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout. Note the positions of walls, water, and the catapult, as well as the goal's location.\n2. **Planning Movement**: When moving, consider the potential consequences of your actions. For example, moving into water results in elimination, so plan alternate routes.\n3. **Using the Catapult**: Utilize the catapult strategically to control sprite movement and possibly clear pathways to the goal.\n4. **Direction Changes**: Make use of directional indicators to avoid obstacles. Know when to transform to make the most effective movement.\n5. **Sprite Interactions**: Understand which interactions will result in loss or progress. For example, transforming walls or using bullets can create advantageous scenarios.\n6. **Prioritize Goals**: Always keep the goal in focus, attempting to reduce any sprite counters leading to a win while avoiding actions that could lead to losing the avatar.\n\nIn essence, observation and careful planning are key to navigating this puzzle-platformer efficiently while ensuring the avatar survives and reaches the goal successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To begin with, we need to identify the position of the avatar ('a'). Given the information from the current state, the avatar is not explicitly provided, but I will examine the grid for possible coordinates of the player character based on the elements visible on the map.\n\nI can see the \"goal\" at `row=9, col=1` (indicated by '#'), which is one of our objectives. Several obstacles arise from walls ('*') and water ('e'). The water blocks my path, and will eliminate my avatar if I attempt to cross it.\n\nBased on the sprite mapping and the provided game state, I can infer that the avatar might be represented in the middle of my grid experience since the specific coordinate for 'a' was not provided in the output.\n\nGiven the layout previously discussed, the primary objective is to navigate towards the goal (<g>) positioned at row 9, col 1. However, I have to also look for ways to traverse around water and walls.\n\nGiven my understanding that the avatar needs to avoid water and continue toward the goal while minimizing risks:\n\nI will execute the action to move **UP** (4) from my assumed position, analyzing the consequences and ensuring I maneuver correctly.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should lead the avatar closer to potential paths that lead toward the goal while avoiding immediate hazards, such as water. I expect that executing this move might lead to a higher chance to reach the goal successfully.",
