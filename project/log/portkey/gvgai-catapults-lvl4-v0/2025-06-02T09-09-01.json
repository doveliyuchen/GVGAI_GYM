    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules, the game appears to be a **maze or puzzle platformer** with elements of strategy and resource management. Players navigate the environment and interact with various objects and sprites to achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Movement and Orientation**: Players control an avatar that can face in different directions (north, south, east, west) by interacting with orientation sprites.\n- **Interactivity**: Players can interact with various objects like walls, catapults, and bullets. Each interaction has specific outcomes:\n  - **Bullet and Wall**: Bullets can transform into moving avatars (sprites).\n  - **Avatar and Catapult**: Being 'caught' by the catapult results in the loss of the avatar.\n  - **Avatar and Goal**: Reaching the goal sprite will also result in the avatar's destruction, implying a score change.\n- **Sprite Types**: There are immovable sprites (like walls and the goal), moving objects (like bullets), and a catapult that can affect the avatar.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate the maze to reach the goal while avoiding getting caught by the catapult or being killed by other interactions (e.g., moving into water). The player must manage the avatar and aim to reduce the number of goal sprites to zero to win.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no remaining goal sprites (SpriteCounter for goal reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the maze layout. Identify paths to the goal and plan your moves to avoid walls and traps.\n   \n2. **Use Orientation Wisely**: Change your avatar's orientation according to the movement and surrounding elements strategically. This will affect how you interact with the world, allowing for successful navigation.\n\n3. **Avoid Catapults**: Keep a safe distance from catapults, as they can remove your avatar, leading to an immediate loss.\n\n4. **Bullet Interaction**: Utilize bullets effectively to transform walls into moving sprites, which may allow new paths or strategies against static structures.\n\n5. **Plan for Water**: Avoid moving into water as it results in a kill scenario. Use terrain to create barriers against unintended deaths.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Since reaching the goal kills your avatar, calculate whether you can receive a score change favorably by considering other sprites in your surrounding environment. \n\n7. **Iterative Gameplay**: If you find yourself losing or in a poor position, consider re-strategizing based on past rounds. Adjust movement patterns and interactions based on what previously led to failure.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, you can effectively navigate the game while working towards achieving the objectives with minimized risk of losing your avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state of the game and the established rules, I'll analyze the maze layout focusing on the immediate surroundings and potential movement options.\n\n### **Current Position Analysis**\n- The avatar ('a') position is not specified in the current state, but the layout shows different sprites at various coordinates.\n- The goal sprites (represented by 'g') are located at (3, 13), (9, 1), and (14, 9).\n- There are surrounding walls ('*'), water ('e'), and various floors ('0', '1', '2', '3', and their respective moving/goal/rotating versions).\n\n### **Strategic Movement**\nTo proceed towards winning by reducing the goal sprites, I recognize that:\n1. **Avoiding Goals**: Interacting with a goal will kill the avatar, so immediate navigation towards them should be avoided unless a strategy is planned.\n2. **Moving Safely**: We should seek a strategy to avoid the catapults and water while aiming to interact with bullets or navigable paths.\n\nBased on the maze layout:\n- The avatar likely starts near the walls and open spaces. Assuming a more central position within a non-specific row with nearby objects to interact with, I will aim to navigate effectively.\n\n**Next Action Proposal**:\n1. If the avatar's last position and orientation does not change, the next action should be to orient in a specific direction.\n2. I will choose to move upwards (ACTION_UP), as this may present new pathways to interact with bullets or find alternate openings towards goals that can be avoided directly.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action aims to explore potential new pathways and avoid immediate interactions with goal sprites, aligning with the strategy of navigating while avoiding risks.",
