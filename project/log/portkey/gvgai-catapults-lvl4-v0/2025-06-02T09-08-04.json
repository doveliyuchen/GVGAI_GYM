Interacting with the goal results in a kill (or removal) of the avatar and a score change.\n- **Environmental Hazards:** Water can kill the avatar when they move into it, and walls block movement. \n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, avoiding hazards (like water), while successfully reaching the goal sprite. To win, the player must ensure that all goal sprites are interacted with (removed).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning:** The game is won when there are no goal sprites left in the game (SpriteCounter for goals reaches 0).\n- **Losing:** The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify safe paths and the locations of hazards. The map has water and walls, and successful navigation is crucial to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n2. **Prioritize Goals:** Focus on moving towards the goal sprites as quickly as possible. The immediate objectives should be prioritizing paths leading directly to goals, while avoiding the water.\n\n3. **Utilize Direction Changes:** Since the avatar can change its direction based on interaction, consider strategic placement before changing direction to maximize movement towards the goals.\n\n4. **Plan for Hazards:** Be aware of water tiles and plan your movements to circumvent them. Treat water tiles as no-go zones that can eliminate the avatar.\n\n5. **Use of Catapults:** Understand how catapults attract the gaze of the avatar. Strategic use of them can help guide the avatar in the right direction or stall progress if aiming to handle goal sprites in a particular order.\n\n6. **Defensive Play:** The avatar\u2019s health is tied directly to the player's navigation. Avoid engaging in unnecessary interactions that can lead to a loss of the avatar unless strategically beneficial.\n\nBy following these strategies while navigating the level, players can effectively work towards achieving the goals and winning the game while minimizing the risk of loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

The avatar must avoid areas marked as water to prevent elimination.\n\n### Movement Strategy:\n\n- The avatar may currently be facing east (based on various '@' tiles) with an ability to maneuver towards goals.\n- Noting that there is immediate movement necessary to either get closer to the goals or to avoid potential loss, a direction must be chosen.\n\nSince the previous instruction only allows for new actions when the avatar's position has changed, and assuming the need to rotate before movement, I should either:\n1. Review which wall or water tiles are present near potential moves.\n2. Prioritize moving toward either goal with an efficient path, taking care to avoid hazards.\n\nWith this understanding, I will perform a single action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action reflects moving to the right (east), aiming to potentially align closer to the goal while staying aware of surrounding hazards. This adheres to the strategy of prioritizing goals whilst maintaining map awareness.",
