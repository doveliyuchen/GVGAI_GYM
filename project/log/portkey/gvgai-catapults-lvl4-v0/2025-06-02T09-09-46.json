    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle-platformer** genre, where players must navigate a level while solving challenges and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - Various sprites represent different elements in the game including the floor, water, catapults, walls, the avatar (player), bullets, and the goal.\n   - Immovable sprites (like walls and water) define the layout of the level and present obstacles.\n\n2. **Movement and Orientation:**\n   - The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west). The player's facing direction influences interactions with other sprites.\n   - The 'moving' sprite (which likely represents projectiles) can be created through specific interactions.\n\n3. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with the catapult to \"attract gaze\" which may be a mechanic to target or trigger specific actions.\n   - The avatar transforms into different orientations based on the direction it interacts with.\n   - Collision with water results in death for the avatar, while colliding with walls causes it to step back.\n\n4. **Goal and Scoring:**\n   - The primary goal is to reach a \"goal\" sprite; interacting with it leads to a win.\n   - The avatar must avoid losing all its lives (SpriteCounter for avatars reaching zero results in a loss).\n\n#### Objective:\n- The player must maneuver the avatar through the level to reach the goal while managing interactions carefully to avoid collisions with water (which kills the avatar) and walls (which can impede progress).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully reach the goal sprite without losing all instances of the avatar.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar's sprite count becomes zero, indicating all lives have been lost.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Planning Pathways:** \n   - Before moving, analyze the level layout and plot a safe path toward the goal avoiding water and walls.\n   \n2. **Utilizing Catapults:**\n   - Use the catapults strategically to redirect movements or interact with obstacles in creative ways, particularly if they can help you move past walls or toward the goal.\n\n3. **Careful Interaction Management:**\n   - Keep track of the avatar's orientation and interact accordingly to transition between facing directions effectively, ensuring you can navigate towards the goal and avoid water.\n\n4. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - Stay mindful of positions that could lead to collisions with water, especially in tight spaces where wall collisions could push you toward danger.\n\n5. **Iterative Approaches:**\n   - Don\u2019t hesitate to explore different strategies or pathways if the first attempts result in failure, as each level might require a unique approach.\n\nBy following these strategic considerations and understanding the game mechanics, you can improve your chances of successfully reaching the goal while maintaining your avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
