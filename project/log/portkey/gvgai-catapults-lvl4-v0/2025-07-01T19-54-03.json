It involves navigating a character through a 2D environment filled with obstacles and goals, implying elements of strategy and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites which include:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Such as walls, water, and floors that provide the layout and boundaries of the game.\n   - **Interactive Objects**: \n     - The **catapult** serves as a mechanism to launch the avatar.\n     - The **goal** is a target for the player to reach.\n     - The **moving** and **bullet** sprites suggest dynamic interactions and possible projectile mechanics.\n\n2. **Avatar Movement**: Players control an avatar that can change its orientation (facing directions) and interact with the environment using various sprites, emphasizing tactical positioning and movement.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - You **win** by ensuring all goal sprites are eliminated (SpriteCounter for goals reaches 0).\n   - You **lose** if your avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n4. **Interactions**: Key interactions include:\n   - Bullets can destroy walls.\n   - Water kills the avatar, suggesting hazards to avoid.\n   - The catapult can defeat the avatar, allowing for strategic player actions.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level, utilizing the catapult and avoiding water while eliminating all goal sprites. It requires players to both strategize movement and execute precise actions to achieve victory.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Movement**: Since your avatar can be transformed into different orientations, it is essential to plan the movement sequence carefully to navigate obstacles effectively while positioning yourself for optimal interactions.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: The water is a lethal hazard, so first secure paths that keep you away from this area. Always maintain a safe distance while aiming toward the goal sprites.\n\n3. **Use the Catapult Wisely**: Utilize the catapult effectively to eliminate the avatar when needed, but ensure your own avatar is positioned safely to avoid being caught in the crossfire or accidentally getting eliminated.\n\n4. **Exploit Bullet Dynamics**: Use bullets strategically against walls to create pathways, allowing for navigation to the goal sprites. This may involve timing shots and aligning the avatar appropriately before firing.\n\n5. **Checkpoints and Timing**: Being aware of the layout and placement of sprites is crucial. Use the spaces intelligently, making sure to not get cornered or trapped by walls while focusing on reaching the goals.\n\nBy following a thoughtful approach focusing on navigation, strategy, and effective use of mechanics, players can effectively accomplish their objectives while minimizing risks related to hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To determine the best action to take, we\u2019ll analyze the current environment on the game map and the mechanics in play.\n\n### Current Position and Map Layout\n- The avatar's current position is likely in row 7, col 4, where it is on an east-facing floor (`@`).\n- Surrounding sprites include:\n  - Water (`e`) which is a hazard.\n  - The goal sprite (`#`) appears at several locations, notably at (9, 1) and (14, 9).\n\n### Actions to Take\n1. The avatar cannot move downward because of the water (as it is immediately below it).\n2. The left and right movements will either lead to walls or water (most left is wall and water is directly below).\n3. Moving to the right (row 7, col 5) leads to water, while moving left leads to a wall.\n4. Moving up (row 6, col 4) might also be a viable option as that space is an east-facing floor which may provide better mobility.\n5. The corners of the map are mostly risky due to walls or water, suggesting the need to move carefully.\n\nGiven that moving up appears to clear the immediate hazard and keeps options open for further left movement toward potential goals, this would be the best action to take now.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up, avoiding the water hazard directly beneath. My expectation is to reposition safely and explore further options from there, ensuring my avatar isn't eliminated and gaining better access toward the goal sprites.",
