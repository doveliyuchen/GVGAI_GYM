This genre generally incorporates elements of puzzle-solving with platforming mechanics, requiring careful planning and execution to navigate through levels filled with obstacles and enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Features**:\n   - Various kinds of sprites represent different entities (e.g., walls, holes, goals, avatar, boxes, boulders, lasers).\n   - The avatar interacts with other sprites to perform actions - including moving, blocking, killing, transforming, or bouncing.\n\n2. **Interactivity and Consequences**:\n   - The avatar can push boxes and boulders, be killed by lasers if hit frontally, and interact with other sprites (`kill`, `bounce`, `attractGaze`).\n   - The game world features immovable walls, holes (which can be lethal), boulders that can crush the avatar, and a goal that must be reached for victory.\n   - There are also lasers emitted from spawn points that track and kill the avatar if it moves into their path.\n\n3. **Objectives**:\n   - The main objective is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding death from lasers or other lethal interactions.\n   - Scoring is implemented, with the player receiving points for specific actions (such as reaching the goal). \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won by the avatar reaching the goal sprite, leading to an increase in score.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for avatars reaches zero).\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigational Planning**:\n   - Take time to survey the level layout before making any moves. Identify safe paths and routes that can lead to the goal without encountering boulders or lasers.\n  \n2. **Manage Interactions**:\n   - Use boxes strategically to shield against lasers and to manipulate boulders and holes.\n   - If possible, move boulders strategically to clear paths or create advantageous situations (e.g., to block lasers temporarily).\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Be cautious of moving towards lasers, particularly from frontal directions as they are lethal if not approached correctly.\n   - Avoid situations where the avatar can be pinned between walls and boulders or other hazards, ensuring that there is always an escape route.\n\n4. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - Focus on reaching the goal efficiently to earn maximum points.\n   - If there are opportunities to manipulate sprites for additional scoring or bonus paths, take them, but ensure safety against hazards.\n\n5. **Learn and Adapt**:\n   - Use each gameplay session to learn sprite behaviors and patterns, especially for lasers and moving boulders\u2014this knowledge will inform better strategic decision-making in future plays.\n\nBy adhering to this strategy, players can successfully navigate through the level while maximizing their score and minimizing risks associated with hazards in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

This box may assist in blocking any hazards in the future or help manipulate the environment further along the path.\n\n### Execution\n- Command: Move to (11, 3): \"approach the box.\"\n\n#### Reasoning\n- If the game state has not changed after this action:\n  - If the box cannot be interacted with or results in an unchanged state, potential reasons could be:\n    - The box may be blocked by the wall and thus cannot be reached.\n    - The intended move is invalid due to collision detection with walls or other barriers.\n\nIf moving to the box proves unfeasible:\n\n2. **Identify Next Action**:\n   - Given that the direct approach to the box has failed or is not possible, the next best action is to evaluate other nearby items.\n   - The nearest `goal` sprite, while further away, is also important to identify. However, further actions should focus on ensuring the avatar can still progress safely.\n\n3. **Push the Box** (if previously reached during interaction):\n   - If successful in reaching the box, the action would then be to \"push the box\" either towards the goal or to create a strategic barrier against hazards like boulders or lasers.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy maintaining a safe approach towards interactable items like boxes and ultimately aiming towards the goal, this strategic focus allows for a planned and methodical gameplay experience. Each action should be based on change in game state and adjustments according to the surrounding environment.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal (symbol '$') is located at (11, 10) at the far end of the row. \n- The only available interactable item nearby is a `box` at (11, 3), which is two spaces to the right of the avatar.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Approach the Box**: \n   - The next logical step is to move towards the box located at (11, 3). This will enable the avatar to interact with the box, which could assist in clearing paths or creating barriers against hazards further along the route to the goal.\n\n### Execution\n- Command: \"Approach the box.\"\n\n#### Reasoning After Execution\n- If after attempting to move to the box, the game state remains unchanged:\n  - Possible reasons could include:\n    - The presence of a wall hindering movement towards the box at (11, 3) due to an invalid path.\n    - If the avatar tries to move but cannot due to collision detection with the wall.\n\nIf moving to the box is unsuccessful:\n\n2. **Identify the Nearest Interactable Item**:\n   - As the alternative strategy, look at other potential actions. However, due to the proximity of the box compared to other items, the box remains the primary target until movement is confirmed as blocked.\n\n3. **Assess Further Actions**:\n   - If the box can be reached and interacted with successfully:\n     - Next action: \"Push the box\" if this creates a pathway towards the goal or to block off hazards.\n  \n### Conclusion\nBy focusing on interacting with the `box` at (11, 3), the avatar can create opportunities for further movement towards the goal at (11, 10) while ensuring safety from potential hazards. Each action taken should be a calculated step towards either participating with available items or strategizing around obstacles present in the game environment.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Identify safe paths and routes that can lead to the goal without encountering boulders or lasers.\n  \n2. **Manage Interactions**:\n   - Use boxes strategically to shield against lasers and to manipulate boulders and holes.\n   - If possible, move boulders strategically to clear paths or create advantageous situations (e.g., to block lasers temporarily).\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Be cautious of moving towards lasers, particularly from frontal directions as they are lethal if not approached correctly.\n   - Avoid situations where the avatar can be pinned between walls and boulders or other hazards, ensuring that there is always an escape route.\n\n4. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - Focus on reaching the goal efficiently to earn maximum points.\n   - If there are opportunities to manipulate sprites for additional scoring or bonus paths, take them, but ensure safety against hazards.\n\n5. **Learn and Adapt**:\n   - Use each gameplay session to learn sprite behaviors and patterns, especially for lasers and moving boulders\u2014this knowledge will inform better strategic decision-making in future plays.\n\nBy adhering to this strategy, players can successfully navigate through the level while maximizing their score and minimizing risks associated with hazards in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

This will allow the avatar to interact with the box, which is essential for navigating toward the goal.\n\n### Execution\n- **Action**: \"Approach the box.\"\n\n#### Reasoning After Execution\n- If the avatar attempts to interact with the box, and the game state remains unchanged:\n  - **Possible Reasons for Unchanged State**:\n    - A wall may be blocking movement to the right into the box.\n    - There could be game mechanics preventing interaction with the box.\n\n### Alternative Lines of Action\nIf approaching the box fails:\n2. **Evaluate Other Interactable Items**:\n   - The box is the nearest item available for interaction. Therefore, despite any blockages, it remains the primary focus.\n   - **If the box is unreachable at this state**, the next nearest points of interest include other static entities in the environment, though none are as immediately relevant as the box.\n\n### Secondary Action Post-Interaction\nIf the avatar successfully reaches and interacts with the box:\n3. **Push the Box**:\n   - If interaction is successful, the next step would be to \"push the box.\" This could create a pathway to maneuver toward the goal or to block any potential hazards.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe priority should remain on the interaction with the box at (11, 3). Successfully engaging this item can facilitate a path toward the goal at (11, 10) while mitigating risks associated with surrounding obstacles. Continuous evaluation of the surrounding context will ensure that potential hazards are appropriately managed during gameplay.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This allows interaction with the box, which is crucial for navigating towards the goal.\n\n### Execution\n- **Action**: \"Approach the box.\"\n\n#### Reasoning After Execution\nIf the attempt to move to the box at (11, 3) results in no change in state:\n- **Possible Reasons for Unchanged State**:\n  - If the game state does not change, it is likely that the movement towards the box is blocked by an obstacle, such as a wall directly at (11, 3).\n\n### Alternative Options \nIf moving to the box proves ineffective:\n2. **Identify Other Interactable Items**:\n   - Since the box is the nearest item, other nearby interactable sprites are not present. The game does not currently provide alternative immediate interactions, so the focus remains on the box until access is confirmed.\n\n3. **Post-Interaction Steps**:\n   - If the box is successfully approached, the next step should be to \"push the box.\" This may help clear a path or create an advantageous position to move closer to the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe strategic focus should remain on interacting with the box at (11, 3).

Identify safe paths and routes that can lead to the goal without encountering boulders or lasers.\n  \n2. **Manage Interactions**:\n   - Use boxes strategically to shield against lasers and to manipulate boulders and holes.\n   - If possible, move boulders strategically to clear paths or create advantageous situations (e.g., to block lasers temporarily).\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Be cautious of moving towards lasers, particularly from frontal directions as they are lethal if not approached correctly.\n   - Avoid situations where the avatar can be pinned between walls and boulders or other hazards, ensuring that there is always an escape route.\n\n4. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - Focus on reaching the goal efficiently to earn maximum points.\n   - If there are opportunities to manipulate sprites for additional scoring or bonus paths, take them, but ensure safety against hazards.\n\n5. **Learn and Adapt**:\n   - Use each gameplay session to learn sprite behaviors and patterns, especially for lasers and moving boulders\u2014this knowledge will inform better strategic decision-making in future plays.\n\nBy adhering to this strategy, players can successfully navigate through the level while maximizing their score and minimizing risks associated with hazards in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

This interaction is key for future movement toward the goal.\n\n### Execution\n- **Action**: \"Approach the box.\"\n\n#### Reasoning After Execution\nIf the avatar attempts to move to the box and the game state remains unchanged:\n- **Possible Reasons for Unchanged State**:\n  - A wall or some other obstacle (perhaps an interaction limitation) could be preventing the avatar from moving to the right and interacting with the box at (11, 3).\n\n### Alternative Options\nIf moving to the box proves ineffective:\n2. **Assess Other Interactable Options**:\n   - As there are no other interactable items in close proximity, the box remains the primary focus until accessibility is confirmed.\n\n3. **Post-Interaction Steps**:\n   - If the interaction with the box is successful, the next action should be to \"push the box\" to clear a path toward the goal or block any potential hazards.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe focal point of strategy should be on approaching the box at (11, 3). Successfully interacting with this item will enable progress toward the goal at (11, 10), while providing tactical advantages against potential threats. Continuous evaluation of the environment is essential for ensuring safe navigation through the level.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
