It combines elements of navigation, obstacle avoidance, and strategy, featuring an avatar that interacts with various other objects and elements within a level.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game utilizes a grid-based mechanic where the player (represented by the 'avatar') interacts with different sprites like walls, holes, boxes, and various dangerous elements, including lasers and boulders. The interactions dictate how the avatar can move, get blocked, or be harmed.\n\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar can navigate the level but is hindered by walls and can be pushed back if it collides with specific objects.\n- **Object Interaction:** There are various objects that can be pushed, blocked, or utilized to shield the avatar from danger (e.g., boxes can shield from lasers).\n- **Laser and Boulders:** Boulders can transform into a more dangerous state (boulderm) upon interaction. Lasers pose a significant risk, killing the avatar if it comes into contact with them from any angle (except potentially frontal protection).\n- **Score System:** The objective includes a scoring mechanism linked to specific interactions, primarily gaining points by reaching the goal and interacting with certain objects correctly.\n\n#### Objectives\nThe primary goal is to navigate the maze while avoiding hazards, manipulating objects, and ultimately reaching the 'goal.' Achieving this will yield a score change of +5, while interacting with holes can grant +1.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win:** The player wins if the 'goal' is reached, confirmed by the counter for the 'goal' sprite going to zero.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the 'avatar' sprite counter is reduced to zero, typically triggered by interactions that result in death (like getting hit by a laser or falling into a hole).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Movement Carefully:**\n   - Before moving, assess upcoming interactions with available sprites. While the avatar can move freely, the player should avoid getting trapped against walls or dangerous objects like lasers and boulders.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Strategically:**\n   - Make use of boxes for protection. For instance, placing a box between the avatar and a laser can allow safe traversal.\n   - Employ the mechanics of bouncing off or shielding to manipulate the position of dangerous objects to your advantage.\n\n3. **Laser Management:**\n   - LASER interactions must be handled with extreme caution due to their lethal nature. The player should explore indirect paths that minimize laser exposure.\n   - If there are multiple lasers, create safe zones before transitioning between sections.\n\n4. **Maximize the Score:**\n   - While reaching the goal is the aim, if feasible, try to manage interactions with holes to maximize scores over just reaching the exit.\n   - Keep an eye on how many points can be earned through various interactions to optimize point collection.\n\n5. **Observe and Learn Patterns:**\n   - Observe how boulders and lasers act in response to your avatar. Understanding their patterns can help navigate effectively.\n   - Create opportunities to clear paths that might initially look dangerous.\n\nBy merging careful planning with tactical application of object interactions, players can effectively navigate through the game's layout, avoid hazards, and accomplish the objectives set forth.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Here's a high-level strategy for the next steps, considering the current environment:\n\n### Current State Analysis\n- The avatar is represented by `@`.\n- There are walls (`*`), holes (`%`), boxes (`c`), boulders (`b`), and the goal (`$`).\n- The `&` represents an obstacle that can interact with the avatar and should be approached cautiously.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n1. **Initial Assessment of Surroundings:**\n   - Identify immediate threats such as holes that the avatar can fall into and walls that impede movement.\n   - Note the locations of objects that can be manipulated, such as boxes (`c`) and safe pathways.\n\n2. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - From the current position of the avatar, map out a potential movement path that allows for safe traversal toward the goal (`$`).\n   - Aim to reach a safe area first, avoiding any known laser paths or hazardous interactions like holes.\n\n3. **Positioning and Interaction:**\n   - **Utilize Nearby Boxes:** \n     - Move to the nearest box to create a shield against any immediate threats (e.g., if there are lasers nearby or if moving closer to a wall).\n     - Consider pushing the box into advantageous positions to create safe passageways.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes and Hazards:**\n   - Steer clear of holes (`%`) to prevent immediate loss of life. \n   - Carefully navigate around the boulders (`b`) and assess if they can be pushed or manipulated to clear a path.\n\n5. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities:**\n   - While heading towards the goal (`$`), consider interactions with objects that yield points. \n   - Score points by interacting with holes or other collectibles along the way, balancing the goal and score maximization.\n   - If possible, take a route that allows interactions with multiple holes without jeopardizing safe movement.\n\n6. **Engage in Controlled Experimentation:**\n   - If unsure about specific interactions, proceed with caution, observing how the avatar reacts to nearby objects, especially interacting with the obstacles (`&`).\n   - Utilize strategic movements to test boundaries, reducing risks while also assessing the environment for openings.\n\n### Sample Movement Plan\n\n1. Move up from your current position `@` to an empty grid cell (`.`) above.\n2. Move left or right, assessing which path avoids walls while checking for box interactions \u2013 this will help stay safe.\n3. If progressing to the goal requires passing obstacles, think of pushing a box in between to shield against potential dangers ahead.\n4. Maintain flexibility in your approach \u2013 if midway through, the path becomes impractical, reassess and reroute.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe next steps involve a mix of careful movement, strategic manipulation of surrounding objects, and risk assessment. By using the above strategy, the player can navigate through the grid-based environment effectively, maintain a life count, and maximize score potential as they approach the game's objective.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step high-level strategy for the avatar's next steps.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Current State\n\n#### 1. **Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n   - Identify the avatar's immediate surroundings. There are holes (`%`) directly below some of the avatar's positions, which pose a risk if moved into.\n   - There are walls (`*`) present that can hinder movement, but the goal (`$`) is located near the bottom right of the grid.\n\n#### 2. **Movement Options:**\n   - Determine the possible directions to move: up, down, left, or right.\n   - Assess if moving to each available direction leads to safe tiles or traps due to walls or hazards (like holes).\n\n#### 3. **Utilize Boxes and Create Safe Paths:**\n   - Move toward the boxes (`c`), as they can be used to shield the avatar from lasers. If encountering lasers, boxes can provide necessary protection.\n   - Assess positions of boxes relative to lasers and other hazards. If any box can shield against a laser, it should be prioritized.\n\n#### 4. **Navigate Around Holes:**\n   - As there are many holes present, ensure to avoid falling into them on the next move.\n   - Aim to create a pathway around any clusters of holes to maintain safe movement.\n\n#### 5. **Strategic Planning Towards the Goal:**\n   - Keep the goal (`$`) in mind but also consider how points can be accumulated through interactions with holes if there are safe opportunities.\n   - Plan to move closer to the goal while maximizing potential points from nearby holes, ensuring movement does not lead to immediate danger.\n\n### Suggested Moves\n1. **Vertical Movement**: If the current position allows it, try to move vertically downwards to get closer to the goal and assess more interaction opportunities.\n   - Always check if any upcoming tiles are lined with hazards like walls, holes, or lasers.\n   \n2. **Horizontal Movement**: Depending on potential threats below, consider horizontal movement:\n   - Move left or right to navigate towards better positions\u2014especially to align with the boxes (`c`) for protection in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **Use Existing Boxes**: \n   - If there are boxes adjacent to your current position, attempt to push or use the boxes as barriers against upcoming lasers and other hazards.\n  \n### Example Movement Plan\n- **Step Option 1**: Move downwards to a safe spot that allows assessing future moves while avoiding immediate danger.\n- **Step Option 2**: Move horizontally toward a box to interact with, allowing for potential future placements to shield against hazards.\n  \n### Conclusion\nThe next moves should focus on ensuring safety by avoiding the holes and navigating around walls while strategically positioning near boxes for protection. Maintain a direct line of sight towards the goal and maximize point-accumulating interactions when safe avenues are available. Always survey the environment after each move to adapt the strategy as necessary.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The best next move is to navigate towards the box nearby or explore safe tiles to avoid any holes.\n\n#### 2. **Utilize the Box:**\n   - **Objective:** Push the box to create barriers against any potential hazards (particularly towards the boulders and holes).\n   - Moving towards the box will allow it to be used strategically in subsequent moves.\n\n#### 3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Do not move towards holes or boulders until obstacles are addressed. Carefully analyze the movement paths to ensure holes aren't entered inadvertently during routing.\n\n#### 4. **Maximize Points While Approaching the Goal:**\n   - Aim to navigate towards the goal while collecting points from nearby holes, as long as they don\u2019t jeopardize safety.\n   - If safe, explore surrounding holes to gather points\u2014aiming for a combination of score maximization and movement towards the goal.\n\n#### 5. **Create Safe Passageways:**\n   - After moving the box and assessing surrounding hazards, ensure to create a path that minimizes exposure to obstacles, including boulders.\n\n### Next Move Suggestions\n\n1. **Move Right**: The first action should be to move right towards the box. This will allow the avatar to interact with it on the next turn.\n   \n2. **Push the Box**: On the next turn, push the box into a strategic location:\n   - Place it adjacent to a wall to potentially block any forthcoming hazards, or align it in a way that can shield from boulders down the line.\n\n3. **Plan for Goal Progression**:\n   - Once the box is safely positioned:\n     - Evaluate the paths leading towards the goal. Is there a safe way around the holes?\n     - Can more boxes be used to create barriers as the avatar progresses? \n\n### Timeline of Actions\n- **Current Move (Step 1)**: Move `@` right to `box`.\n- **Next Move (Step 2)**: On the subsequent turn, push the box into a strategically effective position.\n- **Following Actions**: Based on the new arrangement, plan adjacent movements towards the goal while keeping the boulders and holes in mind for safe navigation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe key to success in the next step involves utilizing the box for protection while ensuring that navigation around holes is safe. By strategically moving towards and interacting with the box, the avatar lays the groundwork to approach the goal effectively while also maximizing potential score opportunities along the way.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

It can only move left to (7, 1) or right to (7, 3).\n   - Moving down (to (8, 2)) is blocked by a wall.\n\n#### 2. **Assess Risk:**\n   - Before deciding on the move, ensure the next tile is safe. Both left (to `wall`) and right (to empty tile) are safe.\n   - Potential hazards below or around the immediate area should be noted.\n\n#### 3. **Utilize the Box:**\n   - The box at position (8, 4) can be beneficial for blocking potential threats that may arise from boulders. \n   - However, pushing or moving the box currently requires movement down the line, as it is blocked by the avatar's current position.\n\n#### 4. **Maximize Points:**\n   - The goal is to reach (6, 11); however, the additional holes offer quick scoring opportunities. \n   - Ensure to navigate around holes to keep the avatar safe while also considering how to potentially occupy spaces yielding points.\n\n#### 5. **Next Move:**\n   - **Move Right:** The best immediate action for the avatar is to move to the right (from (7, 2) to (7, 3)). This opens up a channel for further movement or further action in the next turn.\n   - This keeps the avatar safe and allows for future interactions with the box or strategic exploration toward the goal.\n\n### Recommended Next Action\n- **Action 1**: Move `@` from (7, 2) to (7, 3).\n\n### Following Strategic Options (Post-Move)\n1. **Determine Next Moves**:\n   - After moving right, assess options. If you can safely move down toward the box in future turns, consider pushing the box to interact with level mechanics strategically.\n   - Plan a route toward the goal while avoiding holes and strategically maneuvering through the grid.\n\n2. **Long-Term Goals**:\n   - Keep an eye on the goal at (6, 11) and evaluate interactions with the holes for points along the route.\n   - Focus on finding a safe path through gaps, avoiding walls, and maximizing the interaction potential with the remaining objects.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy moving right for the initial action, the avatar creates a pathway towards more opportunities in future moves\u2014whether it\u2019s pushing the box for cover, navigating toward the goal, or interacting with points-yielding tiles. This strategic approach prioritizes safety and future flexibility.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

It combines elements of navigation, obstacle avoidance, and strategy, featuring an avatar that interacts with various other objects and elements within a level.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game utilizes a grid-based mechanic where the player (represented by the 'avatar') interacts with different sprites like walls, holes, boxes, and various dangerous elements, including lasers and boulders. The interactions dictate how the avatar can move, get blocked, or be harmed.\n\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar can navigate the level but is hindered by walls and can be pushed back if it collides with specific objects.\n- **Object Interaction:** There are various objects that can be pushed, blocked, or utilized to shield the avatar from danger (e.g., boxes can shield from lasers).\n- **Laser and Boulders:** Boulders can transform into a more dangerous state (boulderm) upon interaction. Lasers pose a significant risk, killing the avatar if it comes into contact with them from any angle (except potentially frontal protection).\n- **Score System:** The objective includes a scoring mechanism linked to specific interactions, primarily gaining points by reaching the goal and interacting with certain objects correctly.\n\n#### Objectives\nThe primary goal is to navigate the maze while avoiding hazards, manipulating objects, and ultimately reaching the 'goal.' Achieving this will yield a score change of +5, while interacting with holes can grant +1.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win:** The player wins if the 'goal' is reached, confirmed by the counter for the 'goal' sprite going to zero.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the 'avatar' sprite counter is reduced to zero, typically triggered by interactions that result in death (like getting hit by a laser or falling into a hole).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Movement Carefully:**\n   - Before moving, assess upcoming interactions with available sprites. While the avatar can move freely, the player should avoid getting trapped against walls or dangerous objects like lasers and boulders.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Strategically:**\n   - Make use of boxes for protection. For instance, placing a box between the avatar and a laser can allow safe traversal.\n   - Employ the mechanics of bouncing off or shielding to manipulate the position of dangerous objects to your advantage.\n\n3. **Laser Management:**\n   - LASER interactions must be handled with extreme caution due to their lethal nature. The player should explore indirect paths that minimize laser exposure.\n   - If there are multiple lasers, create safe zones before transitioning between sections.\n\n4. **Maximize the Score:**\n   - While reaching the goal is the aim, if feasible, try to manage interactions with holes to maximize scores over just reaching the exit.\n   - Keep an eye on how many points can be earned through various interactions to optimize point collection.\n\n5. **Observe and Learn Patterns:**\n   - Observe how boulders and lasers act in response to your avatar. Understanding their patterns can help navigate effectively.\n   - Create opportunities to clear paths that might initially look dangerous.\n\nBy merging careful planning with tactical application of object interactions, players can effectively navigate through the game's layout, avoid hazards, and accomplish the objectives set forth.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\nboulder -> 'h'\nbox -> 'l'\ngoal -> 'w'\nhole -> 'i'\nlcright lright -> 'j'\nlright -> 'k'\nwall -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nm.....................im\nm.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...h.im\nm...h............m.h..im\nm..m.mmmmmmmmmm.h.i....m\nmhhm...........mm...m..m\nm..m....h.h....mmm.mmm.m\nm..m.....h.....mjk.....m\nmhhm...h.......mjk.....m\nm..m...l..miiii...h...im\nm..m......m..........iim\nm.am......m.........iiwm\nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nGiven the current game state and the mechanics described, here\u2019s a high-level strategy for your avatar\u2019s next step in the puzzle-platformer.\n\n### Current State Overview:\n- **Avatar Position:** The avatar is currently located at (7, 2).\n- **Goal Position:** The goal is located at (6, 11).\n- **Nearby Hazards:** There are holes directly surrounding the avatar in several positions, which can lead to immediate loss if the avatar is not careful. \n- **Objects Around:** There is a box available for potential use and several boulders that may create obstacles.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n#### 1. **Assess Immediate Movement Options:**\n   - The avatar can move left to (7, 1) or right to (7, 3). Moving down is blocked by a wall, and the potential options must be evaluated for safety:\n     - **Left (7, 1):** Blocked by a wall (not an option).\n     - **Right (7, 3):** This is a free space. \n\n#### 2. **Move to a Safe Position:**\n   - The safest immediate move is to the right (to position (7, 3)), where it can assess future interactions and options.\n\n#### 3. **Utilize the Box Strategically:**\n   - The box located at (8, 4) can be pushed later to potentially block some hazards or manage boulders. Plan to push this box into a position that can help navigate around the area safely as the avatar progresses.\n   \n#### 4. **Avoid Hazards and Maximize Points:**\n   - After moving right, keep an eye on the holes and boulders. The immediate goal remains the navigation of safe paths toward the goal at (6, 11).\n   - Ensure that future moves do not lead into holes. Once at (7, 3):\n     - Consider the option to interact with the box on subsequent turns.\n\n### Suggested Moves\n1. **Move Right:** Execute the first move by going from (7, 2) to (7, 3).\n2. **Future Turn Planning:** On the next turn, assess whether to:\n   - Move down to (8, 3) to either prepare for pushing the box or to continue moving around obstacles.\n   - Be cautious of the state of nearby holes in future turns.\n\n### Timeline of Actions\n- **Current Move (Step 1):** Move `@` from (7, 2) to (7, 3).\n\n### Follow-Up Strategy Post-Move (After Moving Right)\n1. **Evaluating Future Movements:**\n   - After moving to (7, 3), evaluate whether to move down to (8, 3) or continue right (to (7, 4)), both of which should be safe moves to avoid holes.\n   - If moving down to (8, 3), plan to subsequently push the box towards a beneficial location during the following turns.\n\n2. **Ensure Safe Passageways:**\n   - Always maintain an awareness of the positions of holes and boulders as you plan the next several moves.\n   - Make use of boxes for blocking potential hazards as the situation evolves.\n\n### Conclusion\nStarting with the move to the right, the strategy aims to maximize the avatar's safe positioning while opening up future interactions with objects that can aid in scoring points and progressing toward the goal. This method ensures safety and flexibility while navigating the hazards present in the current environment.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

Notably, there's a box at (8, 4) which could potentially be useful.\n- **Boulders:** There are boulders present, but they don't currently pose an immediate threat.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n#### 1. **Plan Immediate Movement:**\n   - The avatar can move left to (7, 1), right to (7, 3), or down to (8, 2).\n   - Since moving left (to (7, 1)) is blocked by a wall, the avatar can either move right to (7, 3) or down to (8, 2).\n\n#### 2. **Choose the Safer Move:**\n   - **Right (to (7, 3))** is an empty tile and safer than the option below. This will keep the avatar away from direct hazards and allows further evaluation of the environment.\n   - **Down (to (8, 2))** is also an option, but it places the avatar closer to potential hazards, namely the holes and a boulder.\n\n#### 3. **Utilize Boxes Strategically:**\n   - After moving right to (7, 3), assess the position of the box at (8, 4). This box can later be pushed into positions to help shield against any potential dangers (like boulders) or allow for safe routes toward the goal.\n\n#### 4. **Maximize Future Moves:**\n   - After moving right, plan the next move which might involve pushing the box if needed and continuing to navigate toward the goal without encountering hazards.\n   - The goal at (6, 11) is relatively distant, so optimizing the movement and avoiding hazards needs to be a priority.\n\n### Next Move Suggestion:\n- **Move Right**: The avatar should move to position (7, 3) from (7, 2).\n\n### Follow-Up Moves (Post-Move Considerations):\n1. **Evaluate Options After Moving**:\n   - Post-move, check the nearby interaction opportunities with the box and the surrounding elements. Assess whether pushing the box down to (8, 3) provides a strategic advantage.\n   - Keep an eye on holes and boulders that could pose risk in subsequent turns.\n\n2. **Plan Routes Towards Goal**:\n   - Begin moving towards the direction of the goal (6, 11) while ensuring paths remain safe and possible extra points from holes are collected along the way.\n\n### Conclusion\nStarting with a move to the right, the strategy focuses on maintaining safety while creating opportunities for future moves that can lead to the goal. The overall strategy merges defensive play with the potential for scoring, aiming to navigate the maze efficiently while avoiding immediate hazards.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

Additionally, there are walls surrounding the avatar, limiting movement options.\n- **Objects:** There is a box (`c`) located at (8, 4), which can be used strategically, and a couple of boulders (`b`) nearby that could potentially obstruct the avatar's path.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n#### 1. **Plan Immediate Movement Options:**\n   - The avatar can move:\n     - Left to (7, 1) - blocked by a wall.\n     - Right to (7, 3) - safe.\n     - Down to (8, 2) - safe but positioned close to a boulder.\n   - Moving left is not an option due to the wall, so the potential moves are right or down.\n\n#### 2. **Choose the Best Move:**\n   - **Move Right to (7, 3)**: This is the optimal move. Moving right does not put the avatar at risk of entering a hole and keeps future options open.\n\n#### 3. **Utilize Nearby Box Strategically:**\n   - **Future Interaction with Box**: Once at (7, 3), the next move can involve assessing pushing the box at (8, 4) into a position that might be helpful for future moves, possibly as a barrier or a path-clearer against hazards.\n\n#### 4. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Critical to the strategy is to navigate around the existing hazards (holes) and ensure that future moves don\u2019t lead into them.\n   - After moving right to (7, 3), assess future potential threats, especially when planning any interaction with the boulders.\n\n#### 5. **Maximize Safe Scoring Opportunities:**\n   - Keep in mind that while maximizing movement toward the goal is essential, any opportunity to score points from interacting with holes should be considered in a safe manner.\n   - If future moves make it possible to sweep near holes without risk, they should be explored.\n\n### Next Move Suggestion:\n- **Action 1**: Move right from (7, 2) to (7, 3).\n\n### Follow-Up Actions (Post-Move Planning):\n1. **Post-Move Evaluation**:\n   - After moving right, evaluate whether it is beneficial to:\n     - Move down to (8, 3) to position for box interaction.\n     - Move right to other opportunities.\n   \n2. **Potential for Box Use**:\n   - If moving down to (8, 3) is safe, consider pushing the box in subsequent turns. Evaluate whether this can create safe passageways or interact strategically with the environment.\n\n3. **Long-Term Goal Strategy**:\n   - Continue navigating toward (6, 11), ensuring that paths keep the avatar safe from hazards while potentially collecting points safely along the way.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy executing a move to the right (to (7, 3)), the avatar positions itself safely while creating options for the following turn without risk. This strategy maintains flexibility and emphasizes safety against hazards, paving the way for a structured path toward the goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
