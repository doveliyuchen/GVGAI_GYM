The interaction mechanics and the need to navigate through obstacles suggest puzzle-solving elements, while the avatar's movement across the ground and engagement with various sprites indicate platforming. \n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprites, including walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the avatar. Each sprite has a specific function:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include walls and holes that act as boundaries or hazards.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: These include boxes and boulders, which can interact with the avatar and other elements in complex ways.\n   - **Missiles**: Lasers are dynamic hazards that can kill sprites based on their direction and the interaction with the avatar.\n   - **Spawn Points and Goals**: Elements that dictate the beginning and end conditions of the levels.\n\n2. **Interaction Rules**: The interactions dictate how sprites affect one another based on their types. For example:\n   - The avatar can step back when colliding with walls but can also bounce forward upon interacting with boxes.\n   - The goal can be achieved by reaching the goal sprite, granting points and terminating the level positively.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (such as \"lasers\" and \"boulders\") and utilizing the environment (boxes and walls) effectively to navigate through the level. The player must manipulate objects and avoid lethal interactions to maximize their score and progress.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Achieve a counter limit of 0 for the goal sprite by reaching it; upon doing so, the player is rewarded with a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game will terminate in loss if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, meaning the avatar can no longer move or is \"killed\" by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Observation**: Carefully observe the layout to identify where hazards are positioned, where boulders can be placed, and how to use boxes to shield from laser attacks.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes**: The player should leverage boxes to create barriers against lasers and potentially manipulate boulders to clear paths or push them into holes (to score points). \n\n3. **Timing and Positioning**: When navigating around boulders and lasers, timing movements is crucial. Make sure to avoid lasers when they are directed towards the avatar. \n\n4. **Calculate Hazards**: Understand the behavior of the lasers and boulders to minimize risk. For example, if a laser can kill the avatar from a frontal perspective, ensure to navigate around or use boxes for protection before advancing.\n\n5. **Plan Routes**: Before moving, plan routes that maximize safety and efficiency. Utilize walls to create paths that lead towards the goal while ensuring to account for destructible and passive objects that affect movement.\n\n6. **Score Optimization**: If points are important, consider using boulders to kill sprites that can achieve score changes before heading to the goal.\n\nFollowing this strategy and understanding the mechanics of interactions will increase the chances of successfully navigating through the level and achieving the goals set by the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=11, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=0, x=0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nNext, move the **box (b)** downward to create a safe path for reaching the **goal (g)**, but be prepared to change your action if the surrounding state doesn't allow for a clear passage.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Each sprite has a specific function:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include walls and holes that act as boundaries or hazards.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: These include boxes and boulders, which can interact with the avatar and other elements in complex ways.\n   - **Missiles**: Lasers are dynamic hazards that can kill sprites based on their direction and the interaction with the avatar.\n   - **Spawn Points and Goals**: Elements that dictate the beginning and end conditions of the levels.\n\n2. **Interaction Rules**: The interactions dictate how sprites affect one another based on their types. For example:\n   - The avatar can step back when colliding with walls but can also bounce forward upon interacting with boxes.\n   - The goal can be achieved by reaching the goal sprite, granting points and terminating the level positively.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (such as \"lasers\" and \"boulders\") and utilizing the environment (boxes and walls) effectively to navigate through the level.

Each sprite has a specific function:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include walls and holes that act as boundaries or hazards.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: These include boxes and boulders, which can interact with the avatar and other elements in complex ways.\n   - **Missiles**: Lasers are dynamic hazards that can kill sprites based on their direction and the interaction with the avatar.\n   - **Spawn Points and Goals**: Elements that dictate the beginning and end conditions of the levels.\n\n2. **Interaction Rules**: The interactions dictate how sprites affect one another based on their types. For example:\n   - The avatar can step back when colliding with walls but can also bounce forward upon interacting with boxes.\n   - The goal can be achieved by reaching the goal sprite, granting points and terminating the level positively.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (such as \"lasers\" and \"boulders\") and utilizing the environment (boxes and walls) effectively to navigate through the level. The player must manipulate objects and avoid lethal interactions to maximize their score and progress.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Achieve a counter limit of 0 for the goal sprite by reaching it; upon doing so, the player is rewarded with a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game will terminate in loss if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, meaning the avatar can no longer move or is \"killed\" by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Observation**: Carefully observe the layout to identify where hazards are positioned, where boulders can be placed, and how to use boxes to shield from laser attacks.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes**: The player should leverage boxes to create barriers against lasers and potentially manipulate boulders to clear paths or push them into holes (to score points). \n\n3. **Timing and Positioning**: When navigating around boulders and lasers, timing movements is crucial. Make sure to avoid lasers when they are directed towards the avatar. \n\n4. **Calculate Hazards**: Understand the behavior of the lasers and boulders to minimize risk. For example, if a laser can kill the avatar from a frontal perspective, ensure to navigate around or use boxes for protection before advancing.\n\n5. **Plan Routes**: Before moving, plan routes that maximize safety and efficiency. Utilize walls to create paths that lead towards the goal while ensuring to account for destructible and passive objects that affect movement.\n\n6. **Score Optimization**: If points are important, consider using boulders to kill sprites that can achieve score changes before heading to the goal.\n\nFollowing this strategy and understanding the mechanics of interactions will increase the chances of successfully navigating through the level and achieving the goals set by the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The interaction mechanics and the need to navigate through obstacles suggest puzzle-solving elements, while the avatar's movement across the ground and engagement with various sprites indicate platforming. \n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprite Types**: The game features various sprites, including walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the avatar. Each sprite has a specific function:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include walls and holes that act as boundaries or hazards.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: These include boxes and boulders, which can interact with the avatar and other elements in complex ways.\n   - **Missiles**: Lasers are dynamic hazards that can kill sprites based on their direction and the interaction with the avatar.\n   - **Spawn Points and Goals**: Elements that dictate the beginning and end conditions of the levels.\n\n2. **Interaction Rules**: The interactions dictate how sprites affect one another based on their types. For example:\n   - The avatar can step back when colliding with walls but can also bounce forward upon interacting with boxes.\n   - The goal can be achieved by reaching the goal sprite, granting points and terminating the level positively.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (such as \"lasers\" and \"boulders\") and utilizing the environment (boxes and walls) effectively to navigate through the level. The player must manipulate objects and avoid lethal interactions to maximize their score and progress.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Achieve a counter limit of 0 for the goal sprite by reaching it; upon doing so, the player is rewarded with a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game will terminate in loss if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, meaning the avatar can no longer move or is \"killed\" by hazards such as lasers or boulders.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Observation**: Carefully observe the layout to identify where hazards are positioned, where boulders can be placed, and how to use boxes to shield from laser attacks.\n  \n2. **Use of Boxes**: The player should leverage boxes to create barriers against lasers and potentially manipulate boulders to clear paths or push them into holes (to score points). \n\n3. **Timing and Positioning**: When navigating around boulders and lasers, timing movements is crucial. Make sure to avoid lasers when they are directed towards the avatar. \n\n4. **Calculate Hazards**: Understand the behavior of the lasers and boulders to minimize risk. For example, if a laser can kill the avatar from a frontal perspective, ensure to navigate around or use boxes for protection before advancing.\n\n5. **Plan Routes**: Before moving, plan routes that maximize safety and efficiency.
