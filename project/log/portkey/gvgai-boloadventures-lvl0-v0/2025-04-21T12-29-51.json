    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s a breakdown of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy.\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the **puzzle/strategy** genre. The presence of movable sprites, environmental hazards, and the requirement for strategic planning to achieve goals fit this categorization.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Characters/Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n   - **Goals and Obstacles**: Includes walls, holes, boulders, and laser cannons, each with unique interactions.\n   - **Spawn Points and Missiles**: Lasercannon and lasers that introduce danger, requiring the player to navigate carefully.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Players must manipulate objects like boxes and boulders to navigate the environment while avoiding hazards such as walls and lasers.\n   - The avatar has specific interactions with obstacles (e.g., boulders can harm the avatar and holes can also result in losing points).\n   - Boxes can offer a shield against frontal attacks from lasers, indicating strategic placement is critical.\n\n3. **Movement:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, suggesting a kinetic element to navigating levels. The avatar is also affected by interactions with walls and enemies which can alter or reset their state.\n\n4. **Score System:**\n   - Players can score points by navigating successfully to the goal while eliminating hazards, indicating a risk-reward element in gameplay.\n\n#### Objectives\nThe main objective is to navigate from the starting position marked 'A' to the goal marked 'g', while avoiding or overcoming obstacles like walls, boulders, lasers, and holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (g) while the sprite counter of goals reaches zero, contributing a score of 5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, indicating all chances to play have been exhausted.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout since some paths are blocked by walls and hazards. A high-level understanding of the layout will aid in planning moves.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Leverage boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks while also considering how to bounce back to navigate around obstacles or towards the goal effectively.\n\n3. **Manage Boulders**: Use boulders to manipulate the layout when possible, ensuring that they either clear paths or set off events that can help in reaching the goal more efficiently.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning**: Pay attention to the timing of laser movements and plan your routes to minimize the risk of collision. Moving when lasers are not targeting the avatar or in a safe position is crucial.\n\n5. **Learn from Interactions**: Experimenting with various interactions (e.g., pushing boxes in different orientations, triggering laser movements, etc.) will inform you of the best methods to clear the path to the goal.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to eliminate hazards using the boulders and boxes while advancing towards the goal to maximize points. This dual approach will not only enhance your score but also clear the way.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of victory and successfully navigate through the level while avoiding the hazards present.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(1, 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(0,0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\nAt the current location (1, 11), the avatar 'a' is positioned in a grid that features walls, hazards, and items marked by different symbols. The proximity to various objects indicates potential interactions, and a quick analysis of nearby items gives insight into the next move.\n\n#### Avatar Location Overview\nThe avatar is currently located at (1, 11):\n- It is next to multiple obstacles and interactable items, notably:\n  - To the right (1, 12) is a wall \"*\".\n  - At (2, 11) is a wall \"*\".\n  - At (0, 11) is a wall \"*\".\n  - Directly below (2, 11) is an item grid with more walls and interactive points.\n\n### Potential Interactions\n1. **Walls**: Surrounding walls block movement in all directions except downwards to (2, 11), but this is currently also a wall, so moving down is not an option.\n2. **Boxes/Items**: Directly adjacent to the current position are no collectible items or boxes within the reach of the avatar.\n\nThe best way to analyze the situation is to identify the nearest interactable item and strategize movements based on its availability.\n\n#### Nearby Interactable Items\n- The avatar can potentially reach two observable items through strategic maneuvers:\n  1. **Items marked with \"&\" (located at (6, 10) and (6, 11))** which could be helpful in the future. The direct moves to these are blocked right now.\n  2. **Boulders or boxes** could be further away, requiring positioning for access, but are currently relevant.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\nGiven the current constraints:\n- The avatar cannot move in its immediate area due to walls, but it can plan a maneuver towards (6, 10) or (6, 11) in the future.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Since walls are blocking the avatar's immediate movement, the next best step is to continue around the current state, possibly moving one step downward to (2, 11) as it appears less obstructed or devise another overall route towards the collectable items.\n   \n2. **Potential Interaction**: Upon moving down or directing the move towards (2, 10), monitor for opportunities to interact with the boxes noted earlier.\n\n3. **Evaluate Alternatives**: If no walls can be bypassed, consider using all available openings to reach the \"&\" or effectively pave a successful route by future interaction with boxes or boulders.\n\n4. **Take Careful Steps**: Ensure that every movement considers walls, boulders, and laser positions to avoid unnecessary risks of losing avatar positions.\n\nTo summarize the operation in a single directive:\n\n```**Move down to (2, 11) to seek further opportunities to maneuver towards items while ensuring an optimal path towards the collectibles marked \"&\".**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",

The goal now is to assess the situation and determine the best course of action based on where the avatar can move and what items are nearby.\n\n#### Avatar Location Overview\nIn the current state:\n- The avatar 'a' is surrounded by walls on the left (0, 11) and above (1, 10), and is next to walls both below and around its position (all surrounding positions to the left, right, and below contain \u2018b\u2019 walls).\n- The only open space is below at (2, 11), which is also a wall, but moving directly down is blocked to (6, 11) as there are walls in between.\n\n### Nearby Interactable Items\n1. **Items marked with '&'** are located at (6, 10) and (6, 11), which are further down the grid and currently unreachable directly from (1, 11) due to the walls in the way.\n  \n2. The only surrounding walls prevent lateral movement, thus restraining any maneuvering around obstacles without initially creating space elsewhere.\n\nGiven these limitations and observing the state, the avatar cannot move anywhere immediately. Therefore, it seems the character's movements are confined, and interaction with the '&' items is impossible at this time due to a wall being in between.\n\n### Reasoning for Strategy\nSince the avatar cannot take any actions in its immediate circumstance due to walls, it will become critical to focus on potential forward movement towards the nearest reachable interactable item.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Assess Current Movement**: With only the potential space at (2, 11) being a wall, the next logical step must be to consolidate the point of movement while attempting to clear obstacles in the grid.\n\n2. **Strategize Future Movement**: Given the current constraints, moving will likely require backing away and finding a series of future moves leading towards the \u2018&\u2019 items at (6, 10) and (6, 11).\n\n3. **Explore Immediate Positioning**: If the avatar initiates movement to adjacent spaces or avoids walls dynamically, the chance to create a clear path toward goals will open.\n\n4. **Monitor Item Directionality**: Keeping an eye on any routes leading to future interactions will foster an understanding of how the environment shifts each time a move is made.\n\nConsidering the obstacles now, the immediate recommendation is to evaluate the available positions further down in the grid to pave a way towards those '&' items. While they cannot be reached right now, perhaps the game allows repositioning to better approach them in consecutive moves.\n\nTo encapsulate:\n\n```**Move back to a position conducive for future displacement towards available items, prioritizing an analysis of the routes leading to (6, 10) and (6, 11) next.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding context shows that the only way out of the immediate walls is blocked by more walls, indicating no open paths directly available for movement. Additionally, the objective of the game is to navigate toward finding items or goals while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Avatar Location Overview\nIn the current setup:\n- **Current Position**: (1, 11)\u2014completely surrounded by walls on three sides (left at (0, 11), right at (1, 12), and down at (2, 11)), which severely limits movement options.\n- **Potential Moves**: Only one opportunity exists to move down to (2, 11), but this also is a wall. \n\n### Nearby Interactable Items\nLooking at the map:\n- The only interactable items appear to be two marked with '&' located at (7, 10) and (7, 11). However, both of these positions currently cannot be accessed due to a blockade of walls and distances.\n\n### Reasoning for Strategy\nSince the avatar is blocked, the only available course of action would typically involve finding an alternative route. However, the absence of any paths suggests that a significant reevaluation of immediate gameplay strategy is required.\n\nGiven there are no visible or accessible items nearby and direct moves are restricted:\n1. **Position Assessment**: The avatar must first disengage from being effectively trapped.\n2. **Navigational Strategy**: Without visible options now, either anticipate future movement possibilities towards those '&' items or route around any clear paths that could lead to accessible spots.\n  \n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Movement Exploration**:\n   - The first step must be to reach a position that allows movement toward other potential targets or escape routes. The only path available is downward. While it currently leads to a wall, any alternate action must consider future moves in a series.\n\n2. **Position Toward Future Movement**:\n   - If the situation remains unchanged, the only reasoning remains establishing an indirect route following the walls. \n\n3. **Long-term Positioning**:\n   - Seek ways to 'bypass' immediate walls in upcoming routes towards the '&' beyond them and keeping track of possible fluctuations in positioning based on wall arrangements.\n\nGiven the immediate situation and predictions following it:\n\n```**Move down to (2, 11) if possible; otherwise, evaluate alternative routes until a redirect opens up, ensuring at all times to keep the overall layout in mind for accessing the items marked '&' in subsequent moves.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

However, given the current block of walls, these items cannot be accessed at this moment.\n\n### Reasoning for the Strategy\nSince the avatar is effectively trapped with no current movement available, the strategy must focus on potential next moves rather than immediate actions. The objective is to find a way to reach the interactable items or goal further in the game.\n\n1. **Evaluate Movement Options**: The avatar is currently unable to move, and since the state remains unchanged since the last recommendation, it appears the walls are blocking any potential exit.\n\n2. **Long-term Objective**: The goal is still to reach the interactable items '&', but first, it will require positioning to avoid being blocked in future moves.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\nTo summarize the next steps in an abstract way:\n1. **Assess the State Continuously**: Remain focused on checking all available pathways. Since the avatar can't currently move down, left or right, the objective may need reevaluation to scout upcoming areas in anticipation of being able to maneuver around walls.\n  \n2. **Positioning for Future Moves**: Investigate possibilities for movement that might not be visible immediately, allowing pathways to interact with items in upcoming turns.\n\nGiven the current state where the avatar's movement is completely blocked, the next move is effectively limited to waiting or considering known interactions found at other coordinates. The emphasis remains on understanding the layout and future navigation possibilities.\n\nTo encapsulate the operation in a single directive:\n\n```**Wait and observe for any movement opportunities, considering all pathways towards the items '&' located at (7, 10) and (7, 11), as the current movement is blocked by walls.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

However, directly reaching these items from the avatar's current position is impossible due to being surrounded by walls.\n\n### Reasoning for the Strategy\nSince the avatar cannot perform any movement due to walls, the strategy needs to focus on:\n1. **Waiting**: Given that no action can be taken right now, the avatar is effectively stuck.\n2. **Evaluating State**: Since the state is unchanged from the previous assessment, the walls are confirmed to be blocking the way to any interactable items or movement.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\nThe following abstract strategy can be derived considering the avatar's position:\n1. **Maintain Awareness**: Continuously evaluate the immediate environment; as of now, immediate moves are not possible.\n2. **Position for Future Movements**: Unfortunately, there are no current movements available. Any potential movement must consider future tiles after an observable change in the environment occurs. If another viable path opens, prioritize moving toward that direction.\n\nIn this specific state, the next step needs to accept being unable to progress further until future moves become clear.\n\nTo summarize in directive form:\n\n```**Remain stationary and monitor the surrounding area for any future changes that may allow for movement towards items '&' located at (7, 10) and (7, 11), as the current location is blocked by walls with no opportunity to move.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surroundings consist of walls ('b') that completely block movement in all directions:\n\n- Up (0, 11): Wall ('b')\n- Down (2, 11): Wall ('b')\n- Left (1, 10): Wall ('b')\n- Right (1, 12): Wall ('b')\n\nBecause of this limitation, the avatar cannot move from its current position, making it effectively trapped.\n\n### Nearby Interactable Items\nThe nearest interactable items marked with '&' are located at:\n- (7, 10)\n- (7, 11)\n\nHowever, reaching these items from the current position is impossible due to the walls blocking any pathways.\n\n### Reasoning for the Strategy\nGiven that the state has not changed since the previous assessments, it remains clear that the avatar cannot perform any actions or movements due to the wall barriers. This necessitates a strategy of waiting in place until a route can be observed or opened.\n\n1. **Current Status**: The avatar is immobile and cannot access interactable items or navigate towards the goal.\n2. **Long-Term Strategy**: Stay alert for any changes in the environment or game logic that could allow movement.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\nGiven the current constraints:\n- Focus on persistence and situational awareness. Since no movement can be taking place currently, players should remain in place, keeping an eye out for opportunities to act when the environment allows for movement.\n\nThe specific strategy directive is to stay vigilant and prepared for any forthcoming changes that would enable movement.\n\nTo encapsulate in directive form:\n\n```**Stay in place at (1, 11) and await any changes that might open a pathway toward the items '&' located at (7, 10) and (7, 11), as the current position is completely blocked by walls.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of movable sprites, environmental hazards, and the requirement for strategic planning to achieve goals fit this categorization.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Characters/Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n   - **Goals and Obstacles**: Includes walls, holes, boulders, and laser cannons, each with unique interactions.\n   - **Spawn Points and Missiles**: Lasercannon and lasers that introduce danger, requiring the player to navigate carefully.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Players must manipulate objects like boxes and boulders to navigate the environment while avoiding hazards such as walls and lasers.\n   - The avatar has specific interactions with obstacles (e.g., boulders can harm the avatar and holes can also result in losing points).\n   - Boxes can offer a shield against frontal attacks from lasers, indicating strategic placement is critical.\n\n3. **Movement:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, suggesting a kinetic element to navigating levels. The avatar is also affected by interactions with walls and enemies which can alter or reset their state.\n\n4. **Score System:**\n   - Players can score points by navigating successfully to the goal while eliminating hazards, indicating a risk-reward element in gameplay.\n\n#### Objectives\nThe main objective is to navigate from the starting position marked 'A' to the goal marked 'g', while avoiding or overcoming obstacles like walls, boulders, lasers, and holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (g) while the sprite counter of goals reaches zero, contributing a score of 5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, indicating all chances to play have been exhausted.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout since some paths are blocked by walls and hazards. A high-level understanding of the layout will aid in planning moves.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Leverage boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks while also considering how to bounce back to navigate around obstacles or towards the goal effectively.\n\n3. **Manage Boulders**: Use boulders to manipulate the layout when possible, ensuring that they either clear paths or set off events that can help in reaching the goal more efficiently.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning**: Pay attention to the timing of laser movements and plan your routes to minimize the risk of collision. Moving when lasers are not targeting the avatar or in a safe position is crucial.\n\n5. **Learn from Interactions**: Experimenting with various interactions (e.g., pushing boxes in different orientations, triggering laser movements, etc.) will inform you of the best methods to clear the path to the goal.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to eliminate hazards using the boulders and boxes while advancing towards the goal to maximize points. This dual approach will not only enhance your score but also clear the way.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of victory and successfully navigate through the level while avoiding the hazards present.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The game state has remained unchanged, indicating that the walls are still blocking potential movement options. Therefore, there are no immediate interactions possible until the situation allows for movement.\n\n### Strategic Direction\nGiven the constraints:\n1. **Evaluate Surroundings**: The avatar is currently trapped with no available moves.\n2. **Think Long-Term**: Although immediate options are blocked, the long-term goal of reaching the '&' items remains.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\nSince there are no actions to take at the moment, the focus will be on maintaining awareness for any future opportunities.
