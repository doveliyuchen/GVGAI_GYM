It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles, interacting with various items to solve challenges and reach a goal.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and a goal. Each sprite has defined properties and interactions.\n2. **Avatar Control**: The player controls an avatar which can interact with other sprites such as walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers.\n3. **Interactivity**: The player can utilize the boulders and boxes strategically to block or redirect lasers. The avatar has to avoid certain elements (such as lasers and holes) that would cause death or backtracking.\n4. **Scoring System**: The game has a scoring mechanism based on interactions, such as gaining points from achieving goals or performing specific actions.\n\n### Objectives\nThe primary objective is to get the avatar to the 'goal' sprite while navigating through obstacles. Along the way, players can earn points through various interactions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which also increases the score. Additionally, the avatar must remain in play (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated, indicated by the sprite counter for avatars reaching zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation Planning**: Strategize the path to avoid lasers and pitfalls. Understand the layout of the level well before making moves.\n2. **Utilize Objects**: Use boxes and boulders to shield the avatar from lasers. Move boulders into positions that can block lasers or help navigate around them.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Keep distance from holes and be mindful of your positioning concerning lasers as they can kill the avatar if approached incorrectly.\n4. **Score Management**: Collect points whenever possible but prioritize reaching the goal to win the level.\n5. **Backtracking Wisely**: Recognize when to step back (based on interactions like `avatar wall` and `boulder avatar`) to prevent losing the avatar and rethink your next move.\n6. **Timing and Patience**: Some sprites, like the lasercannons, may have timed attacks or placements which require patience to attack or traverse around.\n\n### Concluding Remarks\nThis game presents a distinctly strategic puzzle element combined with platforming challenges. Solving each level requires critical thinking and planning to manipulate the environment effectively while avoiding dangers.

Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The surrounding squares consist of walls, holes, and the goal, with notable items including multiple holes on the right and a goal just further right. However, the immediate right also contains a wall that blocks direct movement.\n\n### Current Available Items\n1. **Walls ('*')**: Around the avatar are walls on the top, left, and right, which create confinement and restrict movement.\n2. **Holes ('%')**: The area near the avatar features three holes along the x-axis towards the right.\n3. **Goal ('$')**: Located at (y=12, x=7), this is the endpoint that must be reached but is currently obstructed by walls and holes.\n\n### Obstacles\n- The path to the right from the avatar is blocked by walls leading to holes, making direct movement toward the goal impossible.\n- The avatar is surrounded on three sides by walls, limiting immediate movement options.\n\n### Strategy to Progress\nGiven the walls obstructing direct movement to the goal and the presence of holes, the avatar needs to find a way to either navigate around these holes or set up a path towards the goal.\n\nAn effective high-level strategy here would be to **move left or down** and to seek a route that avoids holes while reaching the goal.\n\n### Nearest Interactable Item\nThe nearest item for interaction is the boulder located at (y=11, x=4). While the avatar can't currently push the boulders due to the walls directly above and other restrictions, moving towards it first may open up later avenues to manipulate items for reaching the goal.\n\n### Summary Action Plan\n1. **Move left to (y=12, x=0)**: This spot is clear, allowing for further exploration or strategizing around the obstacles.\n2. **Consider maneuvering around to the boulder**: Explore that route after repositioning.\n\n```**move left to (y=12, x=0)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surrounding area consists of:\n- **Walls ('*')**: To the left (x=0), above (y=11, x=1), and a wall directly to the right (y=12, x=2).\n- **Goal ('$')**: Located at (y=12, x=7).\n- **Holes ('%')**: Present at (y=12, x=3), (y=12, x=4), (y=12, x=5), and (y=12, x=6).\n\nThe avatar is completely boxed in by walls to its sides and has holes directly on its right that pose a danger if the avatar moves toward them. \n\n### Obstacles Identified\n- The path directly to the right is blocked not only by walls but also by holes, making it impossible for the avatar to reach the goal immediately.\n- The avatar can only move up or down the column it is currently in (x=1), as both left and right are also blocked by walls and holes.\n\n### Nearest Interactable Item\nThe nearest item for interaction is the **boulder** located at (y=11, x=4), but currently, all movements toward it are obstructed by walls and holes. \n\n### Strategy for Next Move\nSince the avatar is confined and cannot make any direct progress towards the goal due to walls and holes, the immediate goal should be to explore the available path options and prepare for potential moves that might create better opportunities to navigate.\n\nGiven that the only current move option is downward to (y=13, x=1), which is empty ground, the strategy should prioritize finding a safe path that may eventually lead around to the goal:\n\n```**move down to (y=13, x=1)**``` \n\nThis move opens up potential exploration below and secures a safer position away from the hazards in the immediate area.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Gain access to new ground which can potentially lead to other options for movement.\n\n### Summary Action Plan\nSince no immediate interactions or pathways to the goal are available, the focus is to safely escape the confined space of walls and holes.\n\n```**move down to (y=13, x=1)**``` \n\nThis move opens up the potential for further exploration and strategizing toward the goal in subsequent turns.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This move:\n1. Evades the current blockages of walls and holes.\n2. Opens up potential future pathways to interact with boulders or navigate toward the goal.\n\n### Action Plan\nThe strategy to proceed effectively, given the current state, is as follows:\n\n```**move down to (y=13, x=1)**``` \n\nThis move enables exploration of new spaces, potentially unlocking further interactions with items and obstacles to progress in reaching the goal.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
