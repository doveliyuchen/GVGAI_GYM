It involves moving characters (or avatars) in an environment with obstacles, enemies, and goals, requiring strategic planning to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: The game features various sprites, including walls, boxes, holes, and lasers. The player interacts with these elements in multiple ways, such as colliding with them or pushing them. Specific interactions lead to transformations or changes in state, such as the avatar stepping back, being killed, or bouncing back.\n   \n2. **Avatar Control**: The player controls an avatar that can navigate the environment, deal with obstacles (like walls), and interact with other sprites (like boxes and enemies).\n\n3. **Goals and Obstacles**:\n    - The primary goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which gives points and signifies the level's completion.\n    - Various hazards exist, such as lasers and holes that can kill the avatar if contacted in certain ways.\n   \n4. **Termination conditions**: The game ends in two ways:\n    - Winning: occurs when the avatar interacts with the goal, which results in scoring points.\n    - Losing: occurs when the avatar is eliminated, which is indicated by a SpriteCounter limit reaching zero for the avatar.\n\n### Objectives\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the obstacles to reach the 'goal.' Players must avoid hazards that can lead to their avatar's death, optimize interactions with the environment, and score points via specific interactions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite, which is situated at a specific location on the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed by hazards like lasers or falling into holes until the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Map Awareness**: Players should carefully analyze the level layout to identify pathways, potential hazards, and the positioning of the goal. Recognize key obstacles like walls and boulders that can be manipulated.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious around lasers and holes. Understanding the mechanics of the hazards can prevent unnecessary deaths. For example, players should approach lasers strategically, respecting the \u201ckill if frontal\u201d condition.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Strategically**: The boxes can shield the avatar from the frontal lasers. Use them effectively around hazards to create a \u2018shield\u2019 while continuing to navigate toward the goal.\n\n4. **Manipulate Boulders**: Use the boulders and boxes to create pathways or stabilize positions. Analyzing their interactions can open up new routes.\n\n5. **Incremental Progress**: Move cautiously rather than rushing toward the goal. Consider every interaction's outcome and avoid traps until they are clearly understood and manageable.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can significantly enhance their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving the game objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n# -> '@'\n$ -> '#'\n% -> '$'\n& -> '%'\n* -> '&'\n. -> '*'\n@ -> 'b'\na -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n&*********************$&\n&*&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&***b*$&\n&***b************&*b**$&\n&**&*&&&&&&&&&&*b*$****&\n&bb&***********&&***&**&\n&**&****b*b****&&&*&&&*&\n&**&*****b*****&%******&\n&bb&***b*******&%******&\n&**&***@**&$$$$***b***$&\n&**&******&**********$$&\n&c*&******&*********$$#&\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nBased on the analysis of the game's mechanics, obstacles, and the current level state, here\u2019s a high-level strategy moving forward.\n\n### Strategic Overview\n\n1. **Assess Current Environment and Hazards**\n   - The current level state has multiple types of sprites: walls (`*`), hazards (such as `@` and `%`), special blocks (`#` and `&`), and the goal (`$`).\n   - The avatar is surrounded by engaging obstacles, including potential hazards on the immediate paths. Understanding the layout and the interactions between different sprites is crucial.\n\n2. **Pathfinding Toward the Goal**\n   - The player must navigate through the level to reach the goal located at (`$`). Develop a route that minimizes exposure to hazards such as fire (represented by `@`) and damaging sprites (such as `%`).\n   - Identify the safest routes by assessing linear and direct paths. For instance, observe how many tiles need to be crossed to get to the goal while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n3. **Utilize Available Sprites for Protection**\n\n   - **Manipulation of Sprites**: \n     - Utilize blocks (`#` and `*`) to shield your avatar from hazards while creating potential pathways around walls.\n     - If there are any boxes in the vicinity (represented by `c` areas), consider using them strategically to block or redirect incoming threats, particularly the fire hazards denoted by `@`.\n\n4. **Incremental Movement and Observation**\n   - Move one tile at a time, taking the time to assess the neighboring sprites after each move. This slow and steady approach will prevent unexpected deaths from hazards.\n   - Involve careful observation of each sprite\u2019s behavior and characteristics to predict outcomes before proceeding.\n\n5. **Understanding and Planning for Hazards**\n   - Analyze how hazards such as fire (`@`) and damaging sparks (`%`) behave. Knowing how many tiles they can travel before affecting your avatar will allow for better planning.\n   - Consider planned retreating movements to avoid unexpected deaths. This means, for example, backing up if a hazard becomes too proximate.\n\n6. **Optimize Resource Management**\n   - Monitor your SpriteCounter closely. If any current actions are causing your count to dwindle quickly (such as frequent deaths from hazards), re-evaluate your approach.\n   - Set a goal to hit specific checkpoints (like close to the goal) without losing the avatar. This means taking breaks and making careful, calculated movements.\n\n7. **Final Movement Strategy Towards Goal**\n   - Once the optimal path is identified and cleared of immediate hazards:\n     - Move towards the goal (`$`) by checking each tile to ensure that no hazards are active or nearby that will surface.\n     - Establish a safe exit route, ensuring that if move back is required, it can be executed without encountering death.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, focus on a systematic and careful navigation of the level, utilizing the available sprites for protection, and ensuring that hazards are avoided at all costs. Taking incremental steps, monitoring interactions closely, and dynamically adapting the strategy based on immediate observations will greatly enhance your chances of reaching the goal successfully while minimizing the risk of loss through hazard contact.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The goal (`$`) is located at the bottom of the map.\n- **Obstacles**: There are walls (`*`), and other hazards, with certain areas that might create pathways or block paths effectively.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n1. **Immediate Hazards Check**:\n   - The avatar can currently move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. Assess each potential movement.\n   - Important immediate hazards include fire dynamic (`@`) and damaging blocks (`%`), both of which can eliminate the avatar if collision occurs.\n\n2. **Safe Directions**:\n   - **Up**: The tile above the avatar has no immediate danger (`*`).\n   - **Down**: The tile below the avatar has the goal (`$`) but is surrounded by hazards on the left and potentially right, requiring caution.\n   - **Left/Right**: Each left and right direction contains walls, which can neither be crossed nor offer safe holes.\n\n3. **Strategic Movement Choice**:\n   - **Step Up**: Move the avatar up to `(1, y)` where the sprite is clear. This will allow for a better assessment of the goal\u2019s position without immediately stepping closer into danger.\n   - After moving up, assess the surrounding area to determine the next safest move, especially focusing on the center corridor which leads towards the goal.\n\n4. **Using Blocks for Protection**:\n   - Utilize any surrounding blocks (`*`) strategically to shield the avatar from adjacent hazards when later navigating towards the goal.\n   - Plan movements that bring the avatar within a distance from the blocks while keeping clear of the hazards, treating them as temporary safe zones.\n\n5. **Goal Projection**:\n   - After the initial step, reevaluate the lower row leading to the goal (`$`). Simulate potential moves:\n     - If adjacent hazards are pressed away, consider a safe advance downwards, checking for clear routes around hazards.\n\n6. **Incremental Advances**:\n   - Each move should be taken with extreme caution, analyzing if moving into a new position will expose the avatar to death\u2014the next step should always respect the distance from `@` and `%` hazards.\n   - Avoid moving towards the `@` hazards on the upper paths and maintain awareness of surrounding wall placements.\n\n7. **Escape Plans**:\n   - Identify alternative exit paths as proximity increases to the goal; this could involve using walls or sections of the maze as barriers if hazards on the forward path inhibit progress.\n\n### Moving Forward\nFollowing the completion of the above plan:\n1. Move **Up** to the safe tile.\n2. Assess next moves post that shift, determining the best till you can approach the goal more directly.\n3. Maintain a calculated focus on hazards' movements and actively manage the avatar's position to avoid death during progress toward reaching the goal.\n\nThis strategy will mitigate risks as much as possible while allowing clear strategic thinking in navigating to the goal effectively. Always remember that success here hinges on careful, state-aware movements through the level\u2019s maze-like layout.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The goal is directly above several obstacles and a few tiles away.\n   - Hazards include holes that the avatar cannot cross, so positioning needs to prevent stepping into these traps.\n\n2. **Determine Safe Movements**:\n   - The avatar can move left, right, or up:\n     - **Left**: Will slam into a wall (`*`).\n     - **Right**: Opens a path toward the goal but needs careful management of hazards.\n     - **Up**: There is a wall on the tile above.\n\n3. **Optimal First Move**:\n   - **Move Right**: This is the best initial action since it decreases the distance to the goal and allows assessment afterward without immediate risk from hazards.\n   - After moving right, check surrounding tiles for threats and possible pathways toward the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Subsequent Movements**:\n   - After the right move, the following considerations should be made:\n     - If the tile has become adjacent to multiple holes or hazards, the next move should attempt to circle around available boulders or walls to avoid stepping into traps.\n     - If a safe path exists directly towards the goal, aim for minimal movements towards it while assessing hazards.\n\n5. **Utilize Boulder for Cover**:\n   - If there is a boulder or box (if applicable) in the next vicinity, it may be necessary to maneuver it to shield against hazards such as lasers or to block holes. Utilize blocks as barriers or stepping stones, if movement pathways allow for such strategies.\n\n6. **Incremental Assessment**:\n   - After the right move, evaluate the surrounding tiles after each movement. This will help identify any changes and threats while guarding against previous holes.\n   - Stay cautious with movements towards the goal and focus on keeping an optimal distance from hazards.\n\n7. **Approach the Goal**:\n   - Once the path towards the goal is clear of hazards, systematically move down towards the goal, ensuring that each position being moved into is free of threats.\n   - The movement toward the goal should respect adjacent tiles' accuracy to avoid hazards or dead-ends.\n\n### Final Movement Plan\n1. **First Move Right**: Step into the adjacent tile on the right.\n2. **Evaluate**: After the right move, look at the immediate state of the tiles:\n   - Determine if it\u2019s clear to make any subsequent upward or lateral movements towards the goal.\n3. **Continual Monitoring**: Keep a close watch on the hazards and continually update the path toward minimizing risks while approaching the goal strategically.\n\nBy taking these steps, the avatar should be able to make progress safely through the level while maintaining awareness of potential hazards. Always prioritize movement towards the goal with solid risk management to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
