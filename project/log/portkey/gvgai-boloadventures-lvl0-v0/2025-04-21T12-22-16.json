The presence of walls, movable objects, and various types of interactions suggests it encourages players to think critically about how to navigate the environment and utilize items to achieve their goal.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - The game features various types of sprites including immovable walls, holes, goals, avatars, boxes, boulders, and laser cannons. \n   - Each sprite has unique interactions, e.g., the avatar can push boxes, be killed by lasers, or attract attention from boulders.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can perform specific actions based on the combination of objects it interacts with. \n   - There are potentially harmful interactions (like entering a hole or being hit by a laser) and helpful ones (like bouncing off boxes).\n\n3. **Movement and State Changes:**\n   - Certain sprites can transform into others based on interactions (e.g., boulders can become boulderm when the avatar interacts with them).\n   - There are mechanics for returning to previous states or undoing actions (e.g., box and wall interactions).\n\n4. **Score System:**\n   - The game seems to include a scoring based on certain actions, such as moving toward a goal or interacting with items creatively.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal of the game is to navigate the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers) and leveraging other objects (like boxes and boulders) strategically. Collecting items and effectively managing interactions can lead to success.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal (represented by the sprite corresponding to the goal), which results in a score change (score +5).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar reaches a limit of zero in the SpriteCounter, indicating that the avatar has either been killed (in the case of lasers or boulders) or interacted incorrectly. \n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Environment:** Take the time to understand the layout of the level, including walls, holes, and locations of the goal. Mapping interactions between sprites will be crucial to forming a strategy.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders:** Leverage boxes to shield from lasers and manage boulders strategically to keep them from affecting the avatar negatively. Use the bounce mechanic to navigate safely past obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of holes and lasers whenever possible. Understand how lasers function\u2014whether they can kill from the front or all sides\u2014and utilize the avatar\u2019s movement to avoid them.\n\n4. **Engage Wisely:** Strategically interact with the elements on-screen. For example, manipulate the wall, boxes, and boulders to create pathways or to neutralize threats.\n\n5. **Plan Ahead:** Since some actions can lead back to previous states (e.g., with the 'undoAll' mechanic), be mindful of your moves and their effects on the overall scenario.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can optimize their approach to reach the goal efficiently and with the highest possible score. Careful planning and strategic interaction are key to overcoming the game's challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Notably, the immediate vicinity contains various interactable elements, primarily holes and the wall structure itself. There appears to be a path available through a boulder situated to the north along with other boulders located in various positions that could be manipulated to alter the game state.\n\n### Identifying Interactable Items:\nThe avatar can push the boulders, which may create new pathways or trigger further interactions with other walls or holes. Engaging with boulders represents a strategic approach that could open avenues toward the goal while potentially clearing obstacles in the way.\n\n### High-Level Strategy:\n1. **Push Boulder Upwards:** The avatar should move towards the nearest boulder and attempt to push it upwards. This action could potentially clear an obstruction, allowing for a pathway to evolve, as well as positioning the boulder in a manner that may assist in further moves towards the goal.\n\n2. **Assess Future Moves:** After pushing the boulder, the player must assess the new game state for any additional moves or interactions that can be made, especially checking the position of the holes and ensuring that the avatar does not fall into one.\n\n3. **Continue Towards Goal:** Adjust the strategy based on the outcome of the boulder push to either move towards the next boulder or navigate along the walls towards the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most viable immediate action is to interact with the closest boulder to the avatar by moving towards and pushing it in hopes of creating new opportunities and advancing toward the goal.\n\n```**Push the nearest boulder upwards to open a path toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The closest interactable item to the avatar is the boulder directly to its right. Engaging with this boulder may provide a pathway to navigate toward the goal while minimizing the risk of falling into holes or encountering walls that block movement.\n\n### Identifying Interactable Items:\nThe most suitable item to interact with at this point is the boulder to the right of the avatar. Pushing this boulder would not only free up space but may also help strategize a path that leads closer to the goal while managing the environmental hazards.\n\n### High-Level Strategy:\n1. **Push the Boulder:** The avatar should move right and push the boulder. This interaction is likely to create additional space and may open up new passageways since the surrounding area is quite restrictive.\n\n2. **Reassess the Area:** After pushing the boulder, reassess the new configuration. Look for possible paths to either navigate around obstacles or increase proximity to the goal.\n\n3. **Plan for Holes:** Since there are multiple holes in the vicinity, keep track of their locations and ensure that the avatar's next moves are away from these hazards to maintain safety.\n\n4. **Continue Towards Goal:** Depending on the outcome of the boulder push and the space availability, select the next move towards the goal while avoiding any restrictive paths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe next best action involves engaging with the item to the right by pushing the boulder, which will facilitate further movement towards the goal.\n\n```**Push the boulder to the right to create a path toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The space to the right contains a boulder that can be interacted with. By moving or pushing the boulder, the avatar can potentially create more pathways and opportunities to navigate toward the goal.\n\n### Identifying Interactable Items:\nThe closest interactable item is the boulder positioned directly to the right of the avatar. Pushing this boulder would likely enable new paths and may also affect the layout of the surrounding area, particularly since there are holes nearby.\n\n### High-Level Strategy:\n1. **Push the Boulder Right:** Move to the right and push the boulder. This action will create space and may lead to uncovering new interactions, especially as there are holes in the vicinity that need to be navigated carefully.\n\n2. **Reassess After Interaction:** After the boulder is pushed, reassess the game state for new potential routes toward the goal. There may now be newly accessible paths or boulders to interact with that could further facilitate movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Remain cautious of the holes in the area. Ensure any subsequent moves away from the boulder do not lead the avatar into a hole.\n\n4. **Progress Towards the Goal:** After determining a safe path post-interaction, plan the next series of moves toward the goal while keeping in mind the potential hazards and the overall position of walls.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPushing the boulder presents the most immediate opportunity to create pathways. This will be the primary action, followed by cautious movement toward the goal while avoiding the identified hazards in the environment.\n\n```**Push the boulder to the right to create a path toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Mapping interactions between sprites will be crucial to forming a strategy.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders:** Leverage boxes to shield from lasers and manage boulders strategically to keep them from affecting the avatar negatively. Use the bounce mechanic to navigate safely past obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of holes and lasers whenever possible. Understand how lasers function\u2014whether they can kill from the front or all sides\u2014and utilize the avatar\u2019s movement to avoid them.\n\n4. **Engage Wisely:** Strategically interact with the elements on-screen. For example, manipulate the wall, boxes, and boulders to create pathways or to neutralize threats.\n\n5. **Plan Ahead:** Since some actions can lead back to previous states (e.g., with the 'undoAll' mechanic), be mindful of your moves and their effects on the overall scenario.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can optimize their approach to reach the goal efficiently and with the highest possible score. Careful planning and strategic interaction are key to overcoming the game's challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The immediate surroundings are restricted, but there is a boulder directly to the right of the avatar. This boulder is the nearest interactable object, and pushing it may help create a path for further movement toward the goal.\n\n### Identifying Interactable Items:\nThe only interactable item close to the avatar is the boulder positioned on its right. Moving this boulder is crucial for advancing further in the game, potentially allowing access to new areas and pathways.\n\n### High-Level Strategy:\n1. **Push the Boulder Right:** The primary action is to move to the right and push the boulder. This move is necessary to clear the immediate path, opening up potential routes toward the goal.\n\n2. **Reassess the New Situation:** After pushing the boulder, evaluate the surrounding environment once more to determine any new available paths, ensuring that the avatar stays away from any holes or walls that could block further movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Constantly be mindful of the surrounding holes to prevent falling into them. Visibility of these hazards will aid in planning subsequent moves after interacting with the boulder.\n\n4. **Plan Next Moves Towards the Goal:** Following the boulder push, determine the best course of action to approach the goal. Consider whether additional interactions with boulders or walls can be performed effectively to facilitate progress.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe focus should be on pushing the closest boulder right to navigate the environment effectively, ensuring that risks are managed while progressing toward the goal.\n\n```**Push the boulder to the right to create a pathway toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of walls, movable objects, and various types of interactions suggests it encourages players to think critically about how to navigate the environment and utilize items to achieve their goal.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - The game features various types of sprites including immovable walls, holes, goals, avatars, boxes, boulders, and laser cannons. \n   - Each sprite has unique interactions, e.g., the avatar can push boxes, be killed by lasers, or attract attention from boulders.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can perform specific actions based on the combination of objects it interacts with. \n   - There are potentially harmful interactions (like entering a hole or being hit by a laser) and helpful ones (like bouncing off boxes).\n\n3. **Movement and State Changes:**\n   - Certain sprites can transform into others based on interactions (e.g., boulders can become boulderm when the avatar interacts with them).\n   - There are mechanics for returning to previous states or undoing actions (e.g., box and wall interactions).\n\n4. **Score System:**\n   - The game seems to include a scoring based on certain actions, such as moving toward a goal or interacting with items creatively.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal of the game is to navigate the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers) and leveraging other objects (like boxes and boulders) strategically. Collecting items and effectively managing interactions can lead to success.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal (represented by the sprite corresponding to the goal), which results in a score change (score +5).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar reaches a limit of zero in the SpriteCounter, indicating that the avatar has either been killed (in the case of lasers or boulders) or interacted incorrectly. \n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Environment:** Take the time to understand the layout of the level, including walls, holes, and locations of the goal. Mapping interactions between sprites will be crucial to forming a strategy.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders:** Leverage boxes to shield from lasers and manage boulders strategically to keep them from affecting the avatar negatively. Use the bounce mechanic to navigate safely past obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of holes and lasers whenever possible. Understand how lasers function\u2014whether they can kill from the front or all sides\u2014and utilize the avatar\u2019s movement to avoid them.\n\n4. **Engage Wisely:** Strategically interact with the elements on-screen. For example, manipulate the wall, boxes, and boulders to create pathways or to neutralize threats.\n\n5. **Plan Ahead:** Since some actions can lead back to previous states (e.g., with the 'undoAll' mechanic), be mindful of your moves and their effects on the overall scenario.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can optimize their approach to reach the goal efficiently and with the highest possible score. Careful planning and strategic interaction are key to overcoming the game's challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The immediate available direction for movement is to the right, where a boulder is located. Since this is the only interactable item nearby, engaging with the boulder is essential for progressing toward the goal, which is situated further down the level.\n\n### Identifying Interactable Items:\nThe nearest interactable item is the boulder directly to the right of the avatar. Pushing this boulder appears to be the optimal next action, as it may help clear a path towards the goal.\n\n### High-Level Strategy:\n1. **Push the Boulder to the Right:** The avatar should move right and push the boulder. This action will free up space and potentially open new pathways leading towards the goal.\n\n2. **Reassess Surroundings After the Push:** Once the boulder has been moved, evaluate the new layout. Look for other potential moves or items that can be interacted with further along the path\u2014especially considering the positions of holes that should be avoided.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Throughout this process, be cautious of the holes located on the board. Remaining aware of these will help prevent the avatar from falling into them after pushing the boulder.\n\n4. **Determine Next Moves Towards the Goal:** Depending on the new state after pushing the boulder, plan the next series of moves to ensure the avatar safely approaches the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action should focus on engaging with the boulder to facilitate movement through the level, ensuring that the avatar remains aware of hazards surrounding it.\n\n```**Push the boulder to the right to create a pathway toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
