    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **puzzle-platformer** genre, as it involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a grid-like level filled with obstacles and other sprites requiring strategic movement and interaction to achieve a goal.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various types of sprites (static elements, avatars, projectiles) are in play:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and goals serve as fixed boundaries or targets.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can interact with the environment, affecting gameplay.\n   - **Missiles**: Lasers are likely threats that affect the avatar based on directionality.\n   - **Avatar Movement and Interaction**: The avatar can move and interact with different sprites, with specific interactions giving rise to effects like bouncing, killing, or transforming sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions**: Many interactions govern how the avatar and other objects behave:\n   - **Transformations**: Boulders can transform into boulderm sprites when interacting with other objects.\n   - **Killing Conditions**: The avatar can be killed by lasers depending on how they intersect.\n   - **Score System**: Interacting with holes or goals can change the score, indicating point-based objectives.\n\n3. **Movement Dynamics**: The avatar can perform actions like stepping back, transforming, and bouncing off boxes. This suggests that careful planning of movements and interactions is essential for progression.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary goal is to navigate the avatar to reach the **goal sprite (door)** while avoiding obstacles (like walls, lasers, and holes) and utilizing other sprites to solve puzzles (like boxes and boulders). Successfully reaching the goal results in a score increase.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if there are no goal sprites remaining (limit=0), and reaching the goal increases the score significantly.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar count reaches zero (limit=0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout and interactions of the level\u2019s sprites. Identify the paths to the goal sprite and the potential dangers, like lasers.\n\n2. **Utilize Defensive Mechanisms**: Use boxes to shield against lasers by positioning them correctly in front of the avatar when approaching laser paths.\n\n3. **Careful Navigation**: Always anticipate the movements of the avatar concerning walls, boulders, and holes to avoid accidental interactions that lead to the game ending.\n\n4. **Maximize Score Opportunities**: Aim to carefully maneuver to interaction points that involve holes for quick score adjustments by manipulating boulders and boxes.\n\n5. **Plan Their Movements**: Develop a sequence of movements that allow for avoiding potential hazards while progressively moving closer to the goal. Avoid rushing into interactions, as many lead to transformations or deaths.\n\n6. **Iterate on Failures**: Since failure can be part of the strategic process, use each attempt to learn about the mechanics and layout, refining your approach for subsequent attempts.\n\nThis strategy balances offense (reaching the goal) and defense (avoiding hazards) in a structured manner, enhancing the chances of progressing through the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n@\nc\n#\nd\n$\ne\nb\n*\nf\n%\n&\ng\n@\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nTo develop a high-level strategy for the next steps in your puzzle-platformer game, we will analyze the current state and outline the best course of action based on the provided game mechanics and layout.\n\n### Current State Assessment\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is currently positioned near a wall (it seems to be interacting with other sprites). The avatar has various directions of movement available.\n2. **Goals and Hazards**: The current map contains holes, a goal sprite (though not visible in the current view), various types of obstacles including immovable walls, and projectiles (like lasers).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective remains to navigate to the goal sprite while maximizing score opportunities and avoiding hazards that can lead to losing the avatar.\n\n### Prioritized Strategy Steps\n1. **Immediate Movement Decisions**:\n   - Assess current positions of threats and potential paths to the goal. \n   - Identify any immediate hazards caused by lasers or walls blocking movement.\n\n2. **Using Existing Sprites for Protection**:\n   - Check for any boxes or boulders that could be moved to block lasers. Use them to create a shield when passing through tight spaces where lasers are present.\n\n3. **Optimize Score Opportunities**:\n   - Plan routes that allow for interaction with point-scoring holes while proceeding towards the goal. Aim for paths that allow hitting multiple holes in fewer moves.\n\n4. **Focus on Safe Navigation**:\n   - Move towards safe zones, ideally towards spaces that have no immediate threats. Avoid moving into areas that result in unintended death triggers.\n\n5. **Evaluate Surrounding Areas**:\n   - Use sprite interactions to transform objects strategically (e.g., move boulders to create new paths). This can also reveal new directions and potentially open up ways toward reaching the goal.\n\n6. **Sequential Planning**:\n   - Create a series of moves based on the immediate needs and the layout of surrounding sprites. Think a few moves ahead and predict how interacting with one sprite will influence the movement of others.\n\n### Suggested Actions Based on Current Layout\n1. **Start by Moving Up (if possible)**: Check to see if there\u2019s an immediate pathway up or sideways that avoids the closest threats while leading towards more space.\n   \n2. **Utilize Defensive Objects**: If there are defensive objects (like boxes), move them strategically to block laser paths before moving through.\n\n3. **Count Available Moves**: Each subsequent move should take into account how many avatars remain. If the avatar is nearing a critical number, prioritize reaching safe zones and avoiding risky moves.\n\n4. **Increment Score Through Safe Interactions**: Ensure that every movement toward the goal also provides opportunities to intersect with holes that lead to scoring.\n\n5. **Plan for Subsequent Moves**: After every action, reassess the state of the environment. If any potential opportunities arise to score or gain advantages, incorporate those into future plans.\n\n### Conclusion\nNavigating through the current labyrinth while avoiding hazards and maximizing score requires careful evaluation of each move, including the engagement of surrounding sprites and planning ahead to avoid immediate threats. The combination of strategic movement, effective utilization of items, and cautious interactions with the environment will lead to success in reaching the goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

Let's break down the current state and outline a high-level strategy for the next steps.\n\n### Current State Assessment\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is currently denoted by '@' in the grid, and appears to be surrounded by various sprites (boxes, walls, holes, scoring elements, and threats).\n   \n2. **Goal and Hazards**:\n   - The goal is represented by '$', which is likely positioned near hazards (e.g., lasers and/or walls).\n   - There are holes (denoted by '%') that can potentially be used for scoring but may also be connected to dangerous areas if not maneuvered correctly.\n\n### Objective\nThe immediate goal remains to navigate the avatar toward the goal ($) while avoiding hazards and maximizing score opportunities by interacting with different sprites.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for the Next Steps\n\n1. **Identify Safe Moves**:\n   - Assess the immediate cells around the avatar to determine potential safe moves. Consider moving to any open spaces that are surrounded by less hazardous sprites.\n\n2. **Use Defensive Mechanisms**:\n   - If there are boxes nearby, consider moving one to create shields in front of potential laser paths. This ensures safe avatar navigation while moving closer to the goal.\n\n3. **Prioritize Movement Towards the Goal**:\n   - Plan the next move towards the goal ($). If reaching the goal directly is blocked, trace potential alternate routes that could lead towards the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities with holes.\n\n4. **Maximize Interaction with Holes**:\n   - Analyze which holes the avatar can interact with while making progress towards the goal. This allows you to gain points while navigating the maze.\n\n5. **Map Out Possible Interactions**:\n   - After each move, evaluate the new surroundings and how they can be utilized for further actions. Identify which boulders can be transformed or moved, and plan subsequent moves to keep advancing toward the objective.\n\n6. **Cautious Exploration**:\n   - As the avatar approaches each new section of the map, explore cautiously. Always anticipate the potential interactions that could lead to loss of avatars due to lasers or collisions with walls.\n\n### Suggested Move\nGiven the current position of the avatar, here\u2019s a recommended immediate action:\n- **Move Left to an Open Space**: If not blocked, move the avatar left to an open cell. This keeps you safe while evaluating options ahead and may allow for interactions with surrounding sprites without immediately putting the avatar at risk.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After the Suggested Move\n1. **Reassess Position**: After moving, check which spaces are available next. Evaluate options toward the goal ($) while ensuring hazards are accounted for.\n\n2. **Manipulate Surrounding Sprites**: Move boxes or boulders if they can benefit your position or shield you while targeting the goal.\n\n3. **Continue Planning Ahead**: Look ahead two to three moves to ensure that despite moving towards a goal, you maintain a buffer against hazards.\n\n4. **Iterate on Each Attempt**: Use the game\u2019s mechanics to learn from interactions and refine your strategies based on visual feedback from the environment after each move.\n\nBy following this methodical approach, the avatar will be better positioned to navigate through the level safely while achieving the ultimate goal of reaching the goal sprite and maximizing score opportunities.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The immediate options include moving left towards the wall or downward if there are no more walls blocking.\n\n2. **Use Safe Navigation**:\n   - If possible, move downward (assuming there's no wall blocking that space) to open up further movement options in subsequent turns. This will help better position the avatar away from direct wall interactions.\n\n3. **Evaluate Box and Boulder Interactions**:\n   - See if there are any boxes nearby that could be utilized to shield the avatar from potential hazards, such as lasers or other sprites, in future moves.\n   - If there are still boulders, plan to see if they can be utilized to manipulate the space in favor of reaching the goal.\n\n4. **Maximize Touchpoints with Holes**:\n   - As the avatar navigates downwards or sideways, plan for moves that will interact with as many holes as possible. Each interaction can yield points, helping overall scoring.\n\n5. **Plan Towards the Goal**:\n   - Always keep the movement focused on progressing toward the goal. If movement options lead away from direct interactions with the goal, reassess and find alternate safe routes back to that direction.\n\n6. **Iterative Learning Through Movement**:\n   - Each move should be assessed to understand its impact. If an attempted move fails or leads to undesirable sprite interactions, refine the approach for the next move.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n- **Move Down**: Move the avatar downward to the cell directly below. This may open up new pathways and options in future moves, allowing you to better survey and secure a path to the goal. \n\n### Subsequent Steps After the Suggested Move\n1. **Reevaluate Positioning**: After moving down, observe the potential new cells the avatar can now reach and assess the best way to navigate toward the goal.\n   \n2. **Manipulate Surrounding Objects**: Check for any boxes or boulders that can still be interacted with to provide protective barriers or pathways.\n\n3. **Continuously Aim for Holes**: If another hole can be reached, plan for movement there to score points while still staying on track.\n\n4. **Adjust Based on Surroundings**: As new possibilities appear, remain flexible and ready to pivot in movement strategy based on obstacles that emerge or the positions of other sprites.\n\nBy following this strategic framework, the avatar can progressively navigate toward the goal sprite while maximizing scoring opportunities and minimizing risks. Careful evaluation and planning are key to advancing successfully in this puzzle-platformer game.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

We'll take into account the layout, mechanisms, and behaviors of the sprites in play, particularly focusing on the avatar's safe navigation toward the goal.\n\n### Current State Assessment\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is positioned directly with walls on three sides (above, right, and more walls to the left) with potential holes below.\n   \n2. **Goals and Hazards**:\n   - The immediate goal is nearby but requires careful navigation to reach.\n   - Holes and boulders can be potential scoring opportunities and obstacles respectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe ultimate goal is to navigate the avatar to reach the goal sprite (door) while avoiding hazards and leveraging available sprites to score points.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Move Options**:\n   - Since the avatar is surrounded by walls, the only feasible movement is **downwards** into one of the empty spaces. This might also lead to possible interactions with holes.\n\n2. **Assess Downward Movement**:\n   - Moving downward could reveal new routes or points of interaction, so it\u2019s crucial to analyze that space.\n   - Ensure that moving downward does not lead directly into a hazardous position (e.g., preventing the avatar\u2019s death through an immediate hole).\n\n3. **Score Maximization via Holes**:\n   - If the downward move reveals a hole, this should be prioritized. Touching a hole can often yield a quick score adjustment.\n   - Plan subsequent moves to exploit any holes or other scoring opportunities in the space opened by moving down.\n\n4. **Utilize nearby Sprites for Advantage**:\n   - If there are any boxes or boulders that can be moved to create a path towards the goal or shield from hazards, this should be part of your strategy.\n   - Observe if moving a box could prevent lasers or serve to block paths to keep the avatar safer.\n\n5. **Maintain Map Awareness**:\n   - As you progress, continuously reassess the map based on each move made. Adjust the strategy dynamically to adapt to new insights revealed after each action.\n\n6. **Focus on the Goal**:\n   - After assessing the immediate consequences of moving down, always keep the goal in sight. Each subsequent move should ideally decrease the number of moves needed to reach the goal.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n- **Move Down**: The best initial move is to move downward into an unoccupied cell. If this space opens up interactions with holes or other movable objects, further actions can be taken to capitalize on those opportunities.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After the Suggested Move\n1. **Reassess Position**: After moving down, check the immediate surroundings to see if any holes or scoring opportunities become available.\n  \n2. **Evaluate Next Moves**: Determine how to maneuver closer to the goal while considering interactions with any new objects and hazards.\n\n3. **Create Barriers as Needed**: If applicable, consider moving boxes to block hazard paths while keeping the potential goal visible and accessible.\n\n4. **Iterate Learning**: Each action provides a learning opportunity; assess how the move affects the potential paths to the goal and adapt the overall strategy based on new information.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the avatar can effectively navigate the puzzles of the game while maximizing scoring opportunities and minimizing risks. The next immediate move to go down appears both safe and potentially rewarding.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

We'll assess the current layout and provide actionable steps to navigate toward the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities.\n\n### Current State Overview\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is located in a position fringed by walls, with opportunities mostly vertical and possibly to the right.\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal is positioned above the avatar but requires pathway planning given the array of walls and obstacles.\n3. **Nearby Entities**: There are holes and boulders scattered around that can be interacted with to possibly facilitate reach to the goal.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding potential hazards and utilizing interactions with other sprites to gain points and navigate effectively.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n1. ****Immediate Move Assessment****:\n   - The only immediate safe move for the avatar is **moving down** into the unoccupied space below. This would open up the game space further and allow for subsequent moves toward the goal.\n  \n2. **Explore for Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - Moving downward might place the avatar near multiple holes, which offers immediate scoring opportunities. Evaluate whether these can be accessed in upcoming moves.\n\n3. **Path Planning to the Goal**:\n   - After moving down, scan the layout visually to determine the best routes to the goal. This includes identifying cells reachable in the next few moves. Ascertain paths that may involve interacting with boulders or boxes that can be moved to create new paths.\n\n4. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**:\n   - Post downward movement, evaluate if any adjacent boxes can be displaced to provide shelters against potential threats (e.g., lasers) or to reach more advantageous positions. \n\n5. **Prioritize Survival**:\n   - Avoid clear line-of-sight to lasers (if any exist in the future layout) and position the avatar in a way that minimizes risks associated with the immediate moves.\n\n6. **Adapt to New Information**:\n   - After each action, reevaluate the surrounding context. Depending on changes in layout upon moving downwards, adjust movements to maximize efficiency towards the goal while keeping scoring opportunities in view.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n**Move Down**: As this keeps the avatar safe and opens up new sections of the game that can be explored for scoring opportunities and pathways towards the goal.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After Moving Down\n1. **Reassess and Calculate Options**: After moving down, observe new areas accessible for future moves or potential boulders and boxes to manipulate.\n  \n2. **Maximize Hole Interactions**: Check for nearby holes, consider moving towards them, and establish a route to score points.\n\n3. **Move Towards the Goal**: If viable paths become evident after the downward movement, aim to structure next moves that get closer to the goal via safe openings.\n\n4. **Continuously Plan Adaptively**: Use each move to gather new information, reroute as necessary, and always prioritize moving closer to the goal while staying clear of hazards.\n\n5. **Documentation of Progress**: If the game allows, note interactions and their effects to build a broader understanding for refining future strategies.\n\nBy doing these, the avatar will effectively navigate the grid while maximizing scores and maintaining a clear path towards the ultimate objective\u2014the goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The analysis will consider the layout and mechanics of the game to ensure the avatar navigates effectively towards the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Current State Overview\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is located at the bottom of the grid, surrounded by walls, with a pathway directly below. The goal sprite is located nearby in the grid.\n  \n2. **Nearby Hazards**: The avatar faces walls directly adjacent on the left, right, and above. There are holes scattered throughout the layout and boulders that could potentially obstruct movement or provide scoring points if managed correctly.\n\n### Objective Summary\n\n- **Primary Goal**: Navigate the avatar to reach the goal sprite (door) while avoiding hazards and maximizing score through interactions with holes and other sprites.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Move\n\n1. **Immediate Move Identification**:\n   - **Move Up**: Since the avatar is constrained vertically by walls on either side and there are no immediate threats directly above, moving **up** is the best immediate step. This keeps the avatar in a central location for further movement options.\n\n2. **Exploring Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - After moving up, check for potential holes nearby. If accessible, aim to move toward them in the following turns to gain points.\n   - Evaluate the placement of boulders in adjacent cells; they may be manipulated to assist in scoring or blocking hazards.\n\n3. **Path Planning Toward the Goal**:\n   - After moving up, the next moves should prioritize pathways leading toward the goal directly. Analyze the layout to identify open spaces leading toward the goal sprite.\n   - If needed, plan to interact with boxes or boulders after assessing their placements to create safer pathways.\n\n4. **Utilizing Defense Mechanisms**:\n   - Monitor for any potential future threats, such as lasers. If present, consider moving boxes or boulders in subsequent steps to create barriers.\n   - Maintain a focus on avoiding dead-end situations where the avatar may become trapped by walls or hazards.\n\n5. **Stay Agile and Adaptive**:\n   - Always reassess the situation after each move. New openings or hazards may emerge that require a change in strategy or the direction of movement.\n   - Remember to plan ahead; keep moves towards the goal flexible based on whether immediate paths are obstructed.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move up into the open space. This movement will open further options in subsequent turns and potentially clear a path toward scoring opportunities via holes or other sprites.\n\n### Subsequent Actions After Moving Up\n1. **Reevaluate Position**: After moving up, reassess the surrounding cells for immediate scoring opportunities or paths leading to the goal.\n  \n2. **Maximize Hole Interactions in Upcoming Turns**: If there are holes available after the move, prioritize interactions with those to gain quick scores.\n\n3. **Plan Next Moves Towards the Goal**: Immediately check routes to reach the goal while considering the placement of any boulders or boxes to either assist or protect against hazards.\n\n4. **Utilize Analysis and Iteration**: Ensure each action informs the next; if certain routes aren't yielding helpful results, adapt quickly to new circumstances presented by the current layout.\n\nBy following this strategy, the avatar can navigate effectively towards the goal while maximizing potential scoring opportunities and maintaining a clear strategy to avoid hazards. The immediate upward movement serves as a pivotal step in this process.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

There are holes and boulders nearby.\n\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal sprite (door) is located above the avatar but requires navigating through a potentially complex structure involving walls, boulders, and holes.\n\n3. **Nearby Hazards**: Lasers are not explicitly mentioned in this state, but general caution is needed regarding the existing walls and holes.\n\n### Objective\n\n- **Primary Goal**: Navigate the avatar to reach the goal sprite while accumulating points through interactions with holes and avoiding hazards.\n\n### High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Movement**:\n   - The most logical immediate move is **to move upwards**. This keeps the avatar safe from surrounding walls and opens up space for further movement.\n\n2. **Evaluate Surroundings Post-Move**:\n   - After moving up, reassess the new surroundings for opportunities. Explore potential interactions with holes nearby for scoring, as well as openings for further moves toward the goal.\n\n3. **Maximize Scoring Through Holes**:\n   - If any holes are reachable after moving up, plan subsequent moves to interact with those holes. This not only enhances scoring but also keeps the gameplay moving forward.\n\n4. **Leverage Passive Sprites**:\n   - If boulders are accessible, consider moving them to create barriers against any potential hazards or to further clear paths. The manipulation of passive sprites is key to unlocking pathways and enhancing safety.\n\n5. **Plan Towards the Goal**:\n   - After evaluating the post-move space, ensure to include pathing toward the goal in subsequent plans. Identify routes that keep the avatar clear of hazards and focus on openings leading to the goal sprite.\n\n6. **Iterative Learning**:\n   - Use each game action as a learning opportunity. Each time you assess the layout post-movement, adapt your strategy based on the new insights gained about the level.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n**Move Up**: The best immediate action is to move the avatar one space upward into the open space. This move not only provides new opportunities but also positions the avatar favorably for future actions.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After Moving Up\n1. **Reassess the New Position**: After the upward movement, check to see what holes are available for interaction and evaluate the proximity to the goal.\n  \n2. **Interact with Holes if Possible**: If any holes can be engaged upon moving up, prioritize scoring interactions as these can significantly benefit the strategy.\n\n3. **Plan Next Moves Toward the Goal**: Focus on ensuring that the next steps continually progress toward the goal, maintaining flexibility based on the assessed level layout.\n\n4. **Maintain Safe Distances**: Always ensure that each move maintains a safe distance from potential hazards, especially when considering future moves involving boulders or boxes.\n\n5. **Documentation of Interactions**: If applicable, keep track of scoring moves and pathing; this can help identify effective strategies for subsequent rounds.\n\nBy following these outlined strategies, the avatar can navigate through the complex level successfully while maximizing scoring opportunities and avoiding hazards. The initial upward movement sets off the path toward accomplishing these goals effectively.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

This keeps the avatar safe and opens up new possibilities in the next turn.\n\n2. **After Moving Up**:\n   - **Evaluate Surroundings**: Once moved up, check which holes are adjacent and assess whether the next moves can involve interacting with those holes for scoring.\n\n3. **Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - If there are accessible holes after the upward move, prioritize moving towards them in subsequent turns, as they allow for scoring that could improve the overall progress toward winning.\n\n4. **Use Passive Sprites (Boulders)**:\n   - After assessing the surroundings from the new position, check for any boulders that can be manipulated to create pathways or shield the avatar against hazards.\n   - Ensure you have the opportunity to move boulders away from the path to the goal as needed.\n\n5. **Path Planning Towards the Goal**:\n   - Following upward movement, consider any direct paths toward the goal while remaining aware of pending obstacles or opportunities for scoring through holes.\n   - Prioritize pathways with fewer hazards and maximize opportunities for interaction with holes and boulders.\n\n6. **Iterate on Movement**:\n   - Use each movement as a learning experience. After each turn, reassess the environment for new routes or hazards that influence your strategy going forward.\n\n7. **Balance Offense and Defense**:\n   - Remember to maintain a balance between reaching the goal and ensuring the avatar\u2019s safety from traps or hazards, especially while navigating towards the goal.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Move\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move one cell upward into the next open space. This positions the avatar closer to the goal and opens up new scoring opportunities.\n\n### Subsequent Actions After Moving Up\n1. **Reassess Surroundings**: Check after moving up; note the position of nearby holes and their accessibility.\n  \n2. **Maximize Scoring Interactions**: If holes are available, prioritize planning future moves to touch those holes and accumulate points.\n\n3. **Navigate Towards the Goal**: When moving from this new position, make choices that keep the avatar oriented towards reaching the goal while sidestepping obstacles.\n\n4. **Utilize Iterative Learning**: Each successful step should refine the further strategy based on the layout's feedback, ensuring that the path documentation assists future movements.\n\nTherefore, by following this structured approach, not only will you achieve proximity to the goal, but you\u2019ll also maximize scoring opportunities while keeping the avatar safe from hazards. Moving up is the primary step to progress effectively.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The avatar does have an adjacent row of spaces that are open (including potential holes).\n  \n2. **Goal Position**: The goal sprite (door) is located slightly further up and to the right of the avatar's current position, which requires navigating past obstacles, including walls and boulders.\n\n3. **Nearby Hazards**: The grid contains various holes, which present scoring opportunities but must be approached carefully to avoid unintended deaths.\n\n### Strategic Objectives\n\n- **Move the Avatar**: The immediate goal should be to move the avatar closer to the holes and the goal while maximizing potential scoring opportunities and minimizing risk.\n\n### Suggested High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Move**:\n   - **Move Up**: The best immediate action is to move **upward**. This places the avatar in a better position to access the subsequent row with holes and further options without the risk of immediate hazards.\n\n2. **Reassess New Position**:\n   - After moving up, evaluate the new surroundings closely. Check for:\n     - Accessible holes that can be interacted with to gain points.\n     - Potential pathways leading closer to the goal.\n\n3. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - If any holes are within reach after moving upward, prioritize those in the next turn. Engaging with them will provide quick scoring opportunities, which can help in gaining an advantage toward win conditions.\n\n4. **Manipulate Boulders**:\n   - Observe the boulders in the immediate environment after the upward move. If they can be moved to block hazards or open pathways, plan to interact with them accordingly.\n\n5. **Path Planning**:\n   - Develop a movement sequence that continuously progresses toward the goal and utilizes holes strategically for score adjustments. Avoid paths that lead back into walls or present no scoring opportunities.\n\n6. **Iterative Approach**:\n   - After every move, continue to assess the state of the grid. Adapt the movement strategy based on the changing layout and new opportunities that arise.\n\n7. **Balance Offense and Defense**:\n   - While it's important to reach the goal, don\u2019t forget the avatar's safety. Always prioritize moves that keep the avatar away from potential pitfalls or hazards.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Action\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move one space upwards into the open area. This movement maintains proximity to both holes and the potential goal, enhancing future strategic decisions.\n\n### Next Steps After Moving Up\n1. **Evaluate Post-Move Position**: Once the avatar has moved upward, look for the next possible holes and consider interactions with them for scoring.\n  \n2. **Engage Holes for Points**: Prioritize paths that lead directly to accessible holes for immediate scoring in future moves.\n\n3. **Plan Towards the Goal**: Explore how to manipulate or move surrounding boulders to facilitate progress toward the goal after gathering initial points from holes.\n\n4. **Track Progress and Adjust**: Treat each action as a learning opportunity. If a pathway looks blocked or a strategy fails, adapt quickly based on the outcomes observed.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the avatar will be able to navigate through the grid effectively, maximizing scoring potential while ensuring safety as it moves closer to the goal. The immediate upward movement is the key starting point for these strategies.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

This clears the area below and puts the avatar in a position closer to the goal.\n\n2. **After Moving Up**:\n   - **Evaluate the New Position**: Check the cell above for any holes or further opportunities for interaction and paths to the goal. This will inform the next move.\n\n3. **Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - After moving upward, assess if there are any holes adjacent to the avatar. If available, plan to interact with them in subsequent turns to score points.\n\n4. **Manipulate Surrounding Sprites**:\n   - If there are boulders nearby and it is beneficial to manipulate them, consider moving them into positions where they can create barriers or help progress toward the goal.\n\n5. **Plan Subsequent Moves**:\n   - From the new position, determine the safest and most effective route to continue moving toward the goal. Always seek paths that lead closer toward the goal while keeping an eye on potential hazards.\n\n6. **Iterative Learning**:\n   - Each move should be treated as an opportunity to learn. If a pathway is blocked or restricted, reassess and explore alternative routes or strategies.\n\n7. **Defense and Offense Balance**:\n   - Ensure the moves balance reaching the goal while also managing risks from hazards (like lasers and walls).\n\n### Suggested Immediate Action\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move one cell upward into the open space. This allows for further exploration and maintains proximity to the scoring holes and the goal.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After Moving Up\n1. **Check the New Surroundings**: Once moved up, evaluate the accessibility of nearby holes for scoring. \n   \n2. **Prioritize Scoring from Holes**: If accessible, plan to move to those holes in the next round for quick scoring.\n\n3. **Plan to Move Towards the Goal**: Following steps should continue moving upward whenever possible, or sideways if necessary, maintaining a direct line towards the goal. \n\n4. **Use Iterative Evaluation**: With each move, reassess the state of the board for new strategies or threats. \n\nFollowing this disciplined approach will allow the avatar not only to move closer to the goal but also to utilize scoring opportunities effectively while maintaining safety in the face of obstacles and hazards. Strategies should adapt dynamically based on the new states revealed after each move.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

This strategy will be designed to effectively navigate the avatar toward the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Current State Overview\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is located in a narrow space at the bottom of the grid. It has walls on three sides (the left, right, and above) with a path leading directly up towards a goal sprite (door).\n\n2. **Nearby Hazards**: There are several holes available for scoring points, along with boxes and boulders that can be manipulated.\n\n3. **Objectives**: The immediate goal is to reach the door while taking advantage of the holes for scoring.\n\n### Suggested High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Move**:\n   - **Move Up**: The avatar should move **upward** into the open space above. This is the only viable move and will keep the play area progressing towards the goal.\n\n2. **Post-Move Evaluation**:\n   - After moving up, assess the new surrounding cells. Identify accessible holes and make note of any boulders or boxes that can be manipulated.\n\n3. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - If there is a hole adjacent to the avatar post-move, plan to move toward it in the next step to score points. Engaging with holes will increase the score and could potentially open more pathways.\n\n4. **Assess Passive Sprites**:\n   - After evaluating immediate opportunities for scoring, look at the placement of boulders and boxes. Determine if moving any of them would help create a path or shield against potential hazards in following turns.\n\n5. **Plan Towards the Goal**:\n   - Evaluate if there is a direct path to the goal after moving up. Aim to keep progressing towards reaching the door while managing to score along the way.\n\n6. **Iterative Learning**:\n   - Use each movement as a chance to learn about the board\u2019s dynamics. Adjust strategies based on what works and what doesn\u2019t. \n\n7. **Balance Offense and Defense**:\n   - While focusing on reaching the goal, ensure the avatar's safety by avoiding known hazards. Prioritize safe moves that also contribute toward earning points.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Action\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move one space upward. This keeps options open for the next move and allows progress towards the goal.\n\n### Next Steps After Moving Up\n1. **Reevaluate Surroundings**: After the upward movement, check if there are accessible holes and potential threats or paths leading to the goal.\n\n2. **Engage Holes for Points**: If there are holes within reach, assess the best moves to interact with them for quick scoring. \n\n3. **Continue Moving Toward the Goal**: Structure future movements to consistently advance towards the goal, ensuring to maximize scoring opportunities along the way.\n\n4. **Adjusting to New Information**: Treat every action as an opportunity to reassess the environment. If new threats emerge or paths change, adapt the strategy accordingly.\n\nBy following these steps and keeping the focus on both scoring and reaching the goal, the avatar can effectively navigate the puzzle-platformer while maintaining safety from hazards. The immediate upward movement is a crucial first step in this strategy.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

This strategy will focus on navigating the avatar effectively toward the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Current State Overview\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is located at the bottom of the grid, adjacently right of a boulder and a couple of spaces away from walls on the left and above.\n\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal sprite (door) is located above in the same column but is still somewhat distant, requiring strategic movement to reach it.\n\n3. **Nearby Hazards**: \n   - There are holes available for scoring, and boulders that can be interacted with to potentially change the layout or create barriers.\n   - Walls are in close proximity, making navigation somewhat constrained.\n\n### Immediate Objectives\n\n- **Navigate toward the Goal**: Move the avatar toward the goal sprite while taking advantage of scoring opportunities through hole interactions.\n- **Manipulate Sprites**: Use passive sprites (boulders and boxes) to create safer paths or to navigate around hazards.\n\n### Suggested High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Move**:\n   - **Move Up**: The first move should be to **move upwards** to the open space just above the avatar. This keeps the option to maneuver closer to the goal open and allows for further evaluation of surroundings.\n\n2. **Post-Move Evaluation**:\n   - After moving up, check the adjacent cells for any accessible holes or safe paths leading toward the goal. This includes viewing potential next moves and scoring opportunities.\n\n3. **Engaging with Holes**:\n   - If any holes are within reach after the upward move, prioritize those interactions to earn points and progress toward fulfilling win conditions.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulders**:\n   - After evaluating the current position, assess whether any nearby boulders can be moved to:\n     - Block potential hazards (if any exist in the next few moves).\n     - Create paths to holes or further toward the goal.\n\n5. **Plan Next Moves**:\n   - Based on the state after each move, keep planning the next few moves to consistently advance towards the goal.\n   - Be flexible in adapting to new opportunities or hazards that may emerge with each action.\n\n6. **Iterative Adjustment**:\n   - Treat each move as an opportunity to learn about the environment and adjust your overall strategy accordingly.\n\n7. **Balance Offense and Defense**:\n   - While focusing on reaching the goal, ensure the avatar's safety. Avoid paths leading to dead ends or traps.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Action\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move one cell upward into the open space. This move opens up new possibilities and positions the avatar for further action.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After Moving Up\n1. **Reassess the New Position**: After the upward movement, check for any reachable holes and evaluate the potential routes to the goal.\n  \n2. **Maximize Hole Interactions**: If holes are accessible, plan to move towards them in the next step to score efficiently.\n\n3. **Continue Planning Towards the Goal**: Aim to structure subsequent movements that continue to push the avatar toward the goal while leveraging scoring opportunities.\n\n4. **Use Dynamically Gained Information**: After each action, keep iterating on your strategy based on the new layout insights, ensuring each move is both safe and progressive toward the win.\n\nBy following these steps and focusing on both scoring and safely navigating the puzzle, the avatar will effectively move closer to the goal while maximizing the potential for obtaining points. The immediate upward movement initiates this logical progression.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

This strategy will focus on effectively navigating the avatar toward the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities and managing hazards.\n\n### Current State Overview\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is next to a boulder, with walls on its left and above. The only viable options for movement are up or right.\n   \n2. **Goal Position**: The goal sprite (door) is located at the top of the grid, with several holes and boulders nearby, providing opportunities to score points.\n\n3. **Nearby Hazards**: There are several holes and boulders scattered throughout the surrounding area. There is no immediate threat from lasers, but it's still essential to navigate carefully.\n\n### Objectives\n\n- **Navigate towards the Goal**: Move the avatar closer to the goal while interacting with points that can help in scoring.\n- **Utilize Available Holes**: Ensure that the avatar can maneuver to the holes for quick score increases while avoiding potential hazards.\n\n### Suggested High-Level Strategy Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Move**:\n   - **Move Up**: The first immediate action should be to **move up** into the cell directly above. This continues progressing towards the goal and opens up potential interactions that may allow scoring and further movement options.\n\n2. **Evaluate the New Position**:\n   - After moving up, reassess the surrounding area. Look for accessible holes or pathways that lead towards the goal. This will guide subsequent movements.\n\n3. **Focus on Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - If after moving up there are holes within reach, prioritize those interactions, as they will increase the score and may fulfill certain game conditions.\n\n4. **Manipulate Boulders if Necessary**:\n   - Check if there are nearby boulders that can be manipulated to create safer pathways or protect the avatar from potential hazards. Consider moving boulders to shield against upcoming threats if they present themselves.\n\n5. **Plan Subsequent Moves Towards the Goal**:\n   - Strategy for the next moves should always lean towards reaching the goal as efficiently as possible. If there are alternative paths or holes that allow for scoring without losing progress, consider those routes.\n\n6. **Iterative Learning**:\n   - Each action should serve as a learning opportunity. After every move, continually reassess the board layout and adapt strategies based on the new state.\n\n7. **Balance Offensive and Defensive Strategies**:\n   - While striving to reach the goal, continuously monitor potential hazards that could hinder progress, such as walls and any future encounters with obstacles.\n\n### Suggested Immediate Action\n**Move Up**: The avatar should move one cell upward. This move effectively maintains a trajectory toward the goal while allowing for further assessment after the move.\n\n### Subsequent Steps After Moving Up\n1. **Reevaluate Position**: After the upward movement, assess any holes or new paths that are now accessible for further scoring or movement toward the goal.\n  \n2. **Engage with Scoring Holes**: If accessible holes are identified after the move, prioritize those in the next turn.\n\n3. **Continue Progressing Towards the Goal**: Keep analyzing paths to ensure that the avatar is making progress toward reaching the goal, and adjust movements as necessary based on newly revealed information.\n\n4. **Track Overall Strategy Adaptively**: Use insights gained from each movement to refine the strategy dynamically, ensuring continuous improvement in reaching the win conditions while maximizing points.\n\nImplementing this structured approach will help the avatar navigate the level effectively while balancing scoring potential against the need for safety and progress toward the goal. The immediate upward movement is a key starting point in this strategy.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
