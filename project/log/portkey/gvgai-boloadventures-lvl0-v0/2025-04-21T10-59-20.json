The surroundings of the avatar contain:\n\n- **Above (10, 1):** wall\n- **Below (12, 1):** wall\n- **Left (11, 0):** wall\n- **Right (11, 2):** wall\n\nThe only interactable item visible in the current state is the **box** located at (9, 2), but the path to it is obstructed by walls. The avatar has no available moves in any direction because of walls.\n\n**High-Level Strategy:**\nGiven the analysis, the avatar is currently trapped with no possible moves to reach the box or interact with any other items. The next strategic steps need to identify the nearest interactable item that can be reached with available movements.\n\nSince there are no valid movements in the current state, we will focus on the only marked item, which is the box. However, since the avatar cannot reach the box and all movements are blocked, we must look for the nearest item that may become relevant either in future states or lead toward progress.\n\n**Considering Nearest Interactable Item:**\nThe box at (9, 2) is unreachable due to walls, and the nearest alternative is the hole at (11, 3), which is also non-interactable effectively in terms of progressing towards the goal.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\nAs there are no movements possible to interact with any items, introduce the next reasoning statement that captures this condition and determine the optimal next approach if a separate strategy was viable:\n\n**Action:**\n- **Reasoning:** The avatar is trapped by walls; no movements can be made towards the box or any interactable item. \n\nIf this situation persists without alteration, subsequent analysis should capitalize on refreshing the game state or identifying pathways to clear obstacles, potentially leading to a strategic reset or seeking alternative routes to facilitate interaction with the box defined in future iterations. \n\nIf pursuing further interactions, the avatar may benefit from a strategy focused on adjacent space consideration:\n- **Next Availability of Moves:** Identify a game state at a later point with potential movements to escape from the walls or observe interactions with other invisible spaces surrounding the area.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

However, this box is two spaces away from the avatar and is also currently unreachable due to walls at every possible path toward it.\n\n**High-Level Strategy:**\nGiven that the avatar is encapsulated by walls, there are no moves available to approach the box or any other item. Thus, we must assess the feasibility of reaching the box and consider the context of the current situation.\n\n### Strategy: \n1. **Reasoning:** The avatar 'a' is trapped with no available moves due to walls blocking all potential movements.\n2. **Action Statement:** Since the box at (9, 2) is unreachable, the strategy will focus on identifying the nearest relevant item that can be approached or influenced when the state changes.\n\n### Nearest Interactable Item Consideration: \nIn this scenario, the holes at coordinates (11, 3) (holes are represented as '%') seem like available spaces but do not provide actionable opportunities as they do not interact meaningfully across the identified goals.\n\nSince reaching the box or hollow option seems futile, we must convey that:\n- The next actionable strategy in this current context is stagnant.\n\n### Conclusion:\n1. **Stagnant State Reiteration:** \"The avatar is blocked by walls; no movements can be executed.\"\n2. **Future Potential:** If the game state changes (e.g., walls removed), the focus will shift toward reaching the box located at (9, 2), pending any new developments. \n\n### Next Steps (if applicable):\nOnce the avatar finds a means to break through the walls, the high-level strategy would be to proceed to the box:\n- **Future Action - if Possible:** \"Approach the box.\" \n\nIn its current condition, the game encourages reevaluation once unblocked opportunities emerge.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

However, accessing this box is impossible from the avatar's current location due to the walls preventing movement.\n\n**High-Level Strategy:**\nGiven the constraints of the environment, the strategy must acknowledge the blockage and the current state of the avatar. \n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Reasoning:** The avatar is surrounded by walls, which prevents any movement towards the box or any other item.\n2. **Action Statement:** Since the avatar cannot interact with the box, the immediate next steps cannot progress the game state. In this scenario, we acknowledge the state remains unchanged.\n\nTo summarize the current condition:\n- The avatar 'a' cannot access any interactive items or move due to walls blocking every direction.\n\n### Finding the Nearest Interactable Item:\nThe nearest item of potential interest is the **hole** located at (11, 3), but this doesn't lead to any beneficial action, as it is also not a productive move toward achieving any goals.\n\nIf we consider other nearby items:\n- Other holes nearby (12, 2) and (12, 3) do not provide actionable alternatives either.\n\nGiven the complete blockades and the inability to interact with any items:\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the current environment does not permit any movements, future strategies must focus on scenarios where openings or pathways become available. \n\n### Final Action for Current State:\n- **Stagnant Condition Reiteration:** \"The avatar is boxed in by walls; no movements can be executed, blocking access to the box and other items.\"\n\nThis encapsulation must remain the focal point until further alterations to the game state allow for actionable strategies such as:\n- **Future Action - if Applicable:** \"Attempt to push the box\" upon gaining access, but at this moment, the state remains unaltered and inaccessible.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
