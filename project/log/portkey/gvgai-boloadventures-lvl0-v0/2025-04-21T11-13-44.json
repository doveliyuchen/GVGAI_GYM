There are significant features involving movement and interaction with various sprites, which indicates a focus on strategic planning within the game world.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various types of sprites exist, including the player (avatar), obstacles (walls, boulders), goals (goal sprite), and hazards (lasers, holes).\n2. **Movement & Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can move around the board and interact with other sprites.\n   - The interaction mechanics include bouncing off boxes, being repelled or pulled by walls and boulders, transitioning states (e.g., standard boulder to a moving boulderm), and killing/dying mechanics involving lasers and holes.\n3. **Scoring System**: Points can be accumulated by interacting with certain sprites, such as the goal which yields a score increase when reached.\n4. **Transformations**: Certain interactions cause transformations in sprites (e.g., a boulder can turn into a moving boulderm).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite, which grants points when successfully reached. Players must navigate through the environment filled with obstacles and potential hazards to achieve this.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The avatar reaches the goal sprite, which results in a score change of +5 and the game is considered won (win=True).\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar can be transformed away or killed if certain negative interactions occur, such as:\n  - If there are no remaining avatars (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False).\n  - Colliding with a laser from the lasercannon results in death based on frontal interactions (killIfFrontal).\n  - Falling into a hole leads to the avatar's demise (killBoth).\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Observing the level layout is crucial. Take note of the walls, obstacles, and goal location. The map suggests a winding path indicating strategic navigation is essential.\n   \n2. **Use Allies (Boxes and Boulders)**:\n   - Utilize boxes and boulders to your advantage. Boxes can shield you from frontal laser attacks and allow strategic positioning in front of walls and holes.\n   - Push boulders strategically to block lasers or clear paths that would lead to the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Minimize facing lasers directly and prioritize navigating around them. Techniques like bouncing off boxes or using boulders to obscure line of sight can be crucial to survival.\n\n4. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Given the interactions lead to various outcomes, strategize your movements and predict the results of your interactions. Avoid any action that could lead you into a hole or directly into the path of a laser.\n\n5. **Securing Pathways**: Create secure paths by positioning objects to block hazardous sprites. If necessary, create barriers with boxes or boulders to protect vulnerable areas while advancing.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can optimize their journey through the map, avoid lethal interactions, and ultimately achieve the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

This position is surrounded by walls on most sides, with the goal located at (y=12, x=8). The course to the goal involves navigating through a few box and boulder obstacles, and avoiding holes and walls.\n\n#### Current State Assessment\nFrom the current state provided, the walls surrounding the avatar restrict direct movement in most directions. The avatar has a clear but restricted path to navigate towards the goal but has to interact thoughtfully with other sprites to avoid potential hazards.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Evaluate Nearby Items**: \n   - The avatar cannot move directly to the goal (x=8) due to walls and has no items available to interact with immediately. The closest interactable item is the box located at (y=10, x=3).\n   \n2. **Movement Plan**:\n   - To successfully reach the goal, the avatar should interact with the accessible box at (y=10, x=3) to push it. This could shield the avatar from potential hazards in the lower part of the map on their way towards the goal.\n\n3. **Focus on Prioritizing Interactions**:\n   - By pushing the box, the avatar can create a safer path or possibly block undesirable hazards during the next turns. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the most advantageous move at this moment is to utilize the box to pave a safer route toward the goal.\n\n```**Push the box**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The goal is at (y=12, x=8), which means the avatar needs to navigate horizontally towards the right to reach the goal. However, there are walls, holes, and obstacles (boxes and boulders) ahead that will require careful maneuvering.\n\n#### Current State Assessment\nThe surrounding environment for the avatar is quite restricted:\n- To the immediate north and south (y=11, x=1 and y=13, x=1) there are walls.\n- To the east (y=12, x=2) is an empty space but ultimately leads down to walls.\n- The path to the box located at (y=10, x=3) is accessible as it is the nearest interactable item.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Look for Interactable Items**: The box at (y=10, x=3) is the nearest item that can be interacted with, and pushing it may create a more optimal path for future moves.\n\n2. **Movement Plan**: Since the box is located above the avatar and there is a clear path to it, the avatar should move upward from (y=12, x=1) to (y=11, x=1) and then continue to (y=10, x=1).\n\n3. **Execute Interaction**: The priority will be to push the box once the avatar reaches (y=10, x=3), allowing the avatar to potentially block hazards or create a path towards the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the next logical step for the avatar is to approach and interact with the box. This will help facilitate movement towards the goal while navigating potential hazards along the path.\n\n```**Move up to the box and push it**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Techniques like bouncing off boxes or using boulders to obscure line of sight can be crucial to survival.\n\n4. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Given the interactions lead to various outcomes, strategize your movements and predict the results of your interactions. Avoid any action that could lead you into a hole or directly into the path of a laser.\n\n5. **Securing Pathways**: Create secure paths by positioning objects to block hazardous sprites. If necessary, create barriers with boxes or boulders to protect vulnerable areas while advancing.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can optimize their journey through the map, avoid lethal interactions, and ultimately achieve the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*..*\n*%%..........*......*a.*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*..*\n*%%..........*......*a.*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=2, x=2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=2, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Avatar Location\nThe avatar (represented by 'a') is positioned at (y=12, x=1). The nearest goal is at (y=12, x=8). The environment contains several walls and holes, making movement carefully strategic.\n\n#### Current State Assessment\n- **Nearby Moves**: The avatar can move east to (y=12, x=2).\n- **Obstacles Ahead**: Continuing east to (y=12, x=3) is also possible, but this leads away from leveraging items immediately.\n- The nearest interactable item is the box located at (y=10, x=3), but reaching it will require planning through (y=12, x=2) and (y=12, x=3).\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Immediate Move**: Move from (y=12, x=1) to (y=12, x=2). This will make the next location not obstructed by walls, allowing further exploration and interaction with adjacent sprites.\n  \n2. **Future Planning**: After reaching (y=12, x=2), next move should be to (y=12, x=3). From there, the avatar can explore upward to interact with the box at (y=10, x=3) effectively.\n\n3. **Interacting with the Box**: After approaching the box, push it to possibly block the hole below or open up pathways in further turns. This will help facilitate movement toward the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe next effective step for the avatar is to take a strategic movement eastward, opening pathways and setting up future turns for maximum benefit. Here is the suggested action:\n\n```**Move east to (y=12, x=2)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
