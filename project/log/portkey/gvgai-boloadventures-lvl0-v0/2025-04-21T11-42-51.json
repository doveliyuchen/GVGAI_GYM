It combines elements of strategy, navigation, and obstacle avoidance with a focus on interactive mechanics involving various types of sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - Different types of sprites act in unique ways, such as immovable walls and ground, passively movable boulders and boxes, and potentially harmful lasers and holes.\n   - The player's avatar can interact with these sprites, each with specific outcomes depending on the interaction types described.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The mechanics include transforming certain items (`boulderm` from `boulder`), pushing objects (the `avatar` bounces off walls or is shielded by boxes), and lethal interactions with `laser` and `hole`.\n   - The `avatar` can be killed in different ways depending on its interaction with the `laser` ( frontal or not).\n   - The ultimate goal is to reach the `goal` while avoiding obstacles and traps.\n\n3. **SitREP (Situation Report)**: \n   - Maps show potential paths and placements of various sprites that can either block progress, act as shields, or present dangers.\n   - A limited number of avatars must navigate to the goal, suggesting resource management and tactical movement are necessary.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the `goal` while maximizing the score. Reaching the `goal` while avoiding obstacles increases the score (`scoreChange=5` upon reaching the goal). \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the `goal`. If the `goal` sprite is no longer present (i.e., it is collected), they achieve victory.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends in loss if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero, suggesting that the player has lost all available attempts or lives.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Before making any moves, take a moment to analyze the level layout. Identify the locations of the `goal`, `holes`, and `lasers` to strategize the safest route.\n\n2. **Careful Movement**: Given the interactions, ensure the avatar does not interact inadvertently with the `laser` or collide with walls that could lead to stepping back unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Use Boxes as Shields**: Utilize `boxes` to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks. Position them effectively to reduce risk and clear the path toward the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Boulders and Holes**: Boulders can kill the avatar, whereas holes will reset its position; thus, navigate carefully around or through safe pathways to minimize risk.\n\n5. **Interaction Exploitation**: Take advantage of the interactions, particularly how `boulders` and `boulderm` can be manipulated. Use these to either push or obstruct lasers on the path to your goal. Strategically position items to keep safe distances between the avatar and harmful sprites.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Since score plays an essential role, consider the interactions that can grant additional points (such as `killing` sprites to maximize your score when possible). Ensuring you don't lose avatars unnecessarily allows more opportunities to score.\n\n7. **Plan Ahead**: Every move matters, and while it may be tempting to rush, careful planning will allow for gauging risks and rewards, leading the avatar more efficiently to the goal.\n\nBy following these strategic guidelines, a player can successfully navigate the puzzles and obstacles to achieve the game\u2019s objectives while maximizing scoring potential.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

It's surrounded by a wall on three sides (top, left, and right). The only available movements are downward (to the `boulder` at (12, 2)) or upward (but it would just bump into a wall). \n\n#### Current State Evaluation:\n- The wall blocks any movement left, right, or up.\n- Moving down to the `boulder` at (12, 2) would be the only possible option at this point, as it will lead further exploration.\n- After moving down, the avatar would have access to several more paths.\n  \n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Move Down**: The first action should be to move the avatar down to the `boulder`. This will open up new possibilities since the avatar's current position is isolated by walls.\n  \n2. **Assess Future Moves**: After moving to the `boulder`, reassess the surroundings to determine the next best action, which will likely involve either:\n   - Attempting to interact with another `boulder` nearby to potentially clear pathways or push it to handle obstacles that are blocking the way further down.\n   - Moving left to explore potential pathways around `holes`.\n\n3. **Prioritize Reaching the Goal**: All moves should be assessed with the goal of eventually navigating toward the `goal`, ensuring to avoid hazards such as `holes`.\n\n4. **Avoid Immediate Threats**: While pushing boulders or navigating, always stay clear of any `holes` and `lasers` to prevent loss of avatars or to avoid reset.\n\n5. **Utilization of Boulders**: Given that interaction with boulders can allow for navigation, actively look for opportunities to manipulate them to create safer paths.\n\nBy executing these strategies, the avatar will begin progressing toward the `goal`, ensuring maximum safety and exploration potential.\n\n```**Move down to the boulder at (12, 2) to access further pathways.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This location is surrounded by walls on both sides, and a `hole` is present directly below it at row 12, column 2. The only options available are to move down to the `boulder` located below or to remain stationary, since left and right movement is blocked by walls.\n\n#### Current State Evaluation:\n- Moving down to the `boulder` at (12, 2) is the only possible option at this stage since all other directions are blocked by walls.\n- Once there, the avatar will gain new potential moves available to continue progressing toward the goal.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Move Down**: The immediate action should be to move the avatar down to the `boulder` at (12, 2). This allows for further exploration and interaction since the avatar is currently limited by walls.\n\n2. **Evaluate New Position**: After the avatar moves to the `boulder`, assess what options are available:\n   - The new position would provide potential pathways to the left, right, or further down, depending on the layout of neighboring states.\n   - Look for opportunities to push the `boulder` in the next move, as it could potentially open up new paths or clear obstacles.\n\n3. **Prioritize Reaching the Goal**: The ultimate aim is to navigate towards the `goal`, so every subsequent decision should reflect Routes leading toward it.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Maintain awareness of the `holes`, which will reset the avatar position, and any potential traps or harmful sprites (like imaginary lasers), ensuring they are not inadvertently crossed.\n\n5. **Utilize Available Sprite Interactions**: If given the chance, use the `boulders` to either shield from hazards or clear the path. Keeping a distance from `holes` is crucial to ensuring progress remains uninterrupted.\n\nBy executing these strategies, the avatar can begin to navigate effectively toward the `goal`, setting a path through the level while preserving the opportunity for high scoring.\n\n```**Move down to the boulder at (12, 2) to explore further options for interaction and navigation towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This position is surrounded by walls on the left, right, and above, blocking any vertical or lateral movement except downward. Directly below the avatar is a `boulder`, and further downward at (12, 2) is a `hole`.\n\n#### Current State Evaluation:\n- The only available movement for the avatar is to move down to the `boulder` at (12, 2).\n- The `hole` is directly beneath the `boulder`, indicating that if the avatar moves down to the `boulder`, the next move could either lead to a `hole` or backtrack to the original position.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Move Down to Boulder**: Since that is the only option available, move the avatar down to the `boulder` at (12, 2). This interaction reveals the next stage and may provide more options for movement.\n\n2. **Assess After Moving**: Upon the avatar\u2019s new position on the `boulder`, assess the surrounding environment:\n    - The immediate goal should be to look for possible paths that can safely navigate towards the goal without encountering holes or walls afterward.\n    - If another path opens up (such as left to potentially avoid the hole), plan the next move accordingly.\n\n3. **Prepare for Hazard Evaluation**: Whenever moving to the `boulder`, maintain caution about eventual steps that could lead downward (to the `hole`). Planning moves in a timely manner avoids potential resets caused by falling into holes or being trapped by walls.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulder Interactions**: If the opportunity arises to push the `boulder` further, strategically position it to block hazards or clear the way to other safe paths leading to the goal.\n\n5. **Focus on Outcome**: Each move should always be directed toward reaching the `goal` while considering scoring opportunities (by avoiding loss of avatars).\n\nBy executing this plan, progress can be made towards the goal while maintaining safety and strategic evaluation of the next moves.\n\n```**Move down to the boulder at (12, 2) to evaluate new potential paths while planning next safe moves.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surroundings consist of walls to the left, right, and above. The only potential move is downward to the `boulder` located at row 12, column 2, just below the avatar.\n\n#### Current State Evaluation:\n- Moving directly down to the `boulder` at (12, 2) is the only feasible option at this moment.\n- The `hole` is also directly beneath the `boulder`, highlighting a potential hazard that could lead to a reset if the avatar moves down without careful consideration.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Move Down to Boulder**: The avatar must move down to the `boulder` at (12, 2) as this is the only available move. It's crucial for advancing through the level.\n\n2. **Reassess After Move**: After moving to the `boulder`, quickly evaluate the surrounding area:\n   - The possible next moves would need strict caution since the hole below can reset the avatar.\n   - Ensure there are no other immediate hazards such as walls on left or right side that could limit the avatar's options.\n\n3. **Determine Next Steps**: The possible next steps after moving down could include:\n   - Pushing the `boulder` if there's a practical purpose for it, such as using it to block future hazards or to clear a path.\n   - Assessing if there are pathways left or right to maneuver around any impending hazards.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay alert for the `hole`, as moving directly down from the `boulder` would lead to a loss. Plan moves carefully to prevent falling into the `hole`.\n\n5. **Focus on Goal-Oriented Movement**: Every action should keep the avatar oriented towards the goal. Calculate if pushing any objects helps reach the goal or increases scoring opportunities.\n\nBy adopting this approach, the avatar can begin progressing effectively, managing risks as they move closer to the goal.\n\n```**Move down to the boulder at (12, 2) to continue progressing through the level, while being cautious of the hole beneath it.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

It combines elements of strategy, navigation, and obstacle avoidance with a focus on interactive mechanics involving various types of sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - Different types of sprites act in unique ways, such as immovable walls and ground, passively movable boulders and boxes, and potentially harmful lasers and holes.\n   - The player's avatar can interact with these sprites, each with specific outcomes depending on the interaction types described.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The mechanics include transforming certain items (`boulderm` from `boulder`), pushing objects (the `avatar` bounces off walls or is shielded by boxes), and lethal interactions with `laser` and `hole`.\n   - The `avatar` can be killed in different ways depending on its interaction with the `laser` ( frontal or not).\n   - The ultimate goal is to reach the `goal` while avoiding obstacles and traps.\n\n3. **SitREP (Situation Report)**: \n   - Maps show potential paths and placements of various sprites that can either block progress, act as shields, or present dangers.\n   - A limited number of avatars must navigate to the goal, suggesting resource management and tactical movement are necessary.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the `goal` while maximizing the score. Reaching the `goal` while avoiding obstacles increases the score (`scoreChange=5` upon reaching the goal). \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the `goal`. If the `goal` sprite is no longer present (i.e., it is collected), they achieve victory.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends in loss if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero, suggesting that the player has lost all available attempts or lives.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Before making any moves, take a moment to analyze the level layout. Identify the locations of the `goal`, `holes`, and `lasers` to strategize the safest route.\n\n2. **Careful Movement**: Given the interactions, ensure the avatar does not interact inadvertently with the `laser` or collide with walls that could lead to stepping back unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Use Boxes as Shields**: Utilize `boxes` to shield the avatar from frontal laser attacks. Position them effectively to reduce risk and clear the path toward the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Boulders and Holes**: Boulders can kill the avatar, whereas holes will reset its position; thus, navigate carefully around or through safe pathways to minimize risk.\n\n5. **Interaction Exploitation**: Take advantage of the interactions, particularly how `boulders` and `boulderm` can be manipulated. Use these to either push or obstruct lasers on the path to your goal. Strategically position items to keep safe distances between the avatar and harmful sprites.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Since score plays an essential role, consider the interactions that can grant additional points (such as `killing` sprites to maximize your score when possible). Ensuring you don't lose avatars unnecessarily allows more opportunities to score.\n\n7. **Plan Ahead**: Every move matters, and while it may be tempting to rush, careful planning will allow for gauging risks and rewards, leading the avatar more efficiently to the goal.\n\nBy following these strategic guidelines, a player can successfully navigate the puzzles and obstacles to achieve the game\u2019s objectives while maximizing scoring potential.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The immediate surroundings include walls to the left, right, and above, with a `boulder` directly below it at (12, 2). Additionally, there is a `hole` located at (12, 3) which would instantly reset the avatar if it were to move directly down from the `boulder`.\n\n#### Current State Evaluation:\n- The only viable move at this point is to move down onto the `boulder`. However, caution is necessary because the next potential move down could lead directly into the `hole`.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Move Down to Boulder**: The avatar must move down to the `boulder` at (12, 2). This is the only option available and will lead to potential new interactions.\n\n2. **Evaluate Surroundings After Moving**: After moving down onto the `boulder`, reassess the environment:\n   - The immediate goal should be to avoid falling into the `hole` at (12, 3). If possible, determine if the `boulder` can be pushed to provide a safer route or alternative navigation.\n   - Consider whether pushing the `boulder` away will create a gap or safe path around the `hole` for future moves.\n\n3. **Use Caution**: When planning the next moves after moving to the `boulder`, ensure that the `hole` is not directly imminent:\n   - Look for potential paths that allow movement left or right from the boulder's position, even if only for exploration or further strategy.\n\n4. **Strategize Toward the Goal**: Focus every move on moving toward the `goal` while simultaneously managing hazards:\n   - After positioning on the `boulder`, any further movement should aim to weave past the `hole` toward the `goal` that is located at (10, 7).\n\n5. **Prepare for Obstacles**: Anticipate and plan for how to maneuver around any `boulders`, walls, or hazards in the next steps that could impede the route.\n\nBy following these strategies, the avatar can continue moving toward the goal while navigating the constraints of the game.\n\n```**Move down to the boulder at (12, 2) to progress further and carefully evaluate the next steps toward avoiding the hole.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

It is enclosed by walls on the left, right, and top, limiting movement options primarily to downward. There is a `boulder` directly below at (12, 2), and further down at (12, 3) is a `hole`, which poses a significant risk of resetting the avatar if moved directly into it.\n\n#### Current State Evaluation:\n- The only viable move for the avatar is to move down to the `boulder` at (12, 2).\n- However, moving down does not provide a safe path, as any further downward movement would lead directly to the `hole`.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Move Down to Boulder**: The immediate action is to move down to the `boulder` at (12, 2). Given the constraints, this is the only available move.\n\n2. **Assess New Position**: After moving down, the avatar should evaluate the new surroundings:\n   - The immediate concern is that moving directly down from the `boulder` would lead the avatar into the `hole`. Therefore, further downward movement should be avoided.\n\n3. **Explore Alternatives for Next Moves**: The potential next options should include:\n   - Pushing the `boulder` left or right, if possible. This could create a potential safe pathway for subsequent moves or could serve as a blockade against hazards like holes.\n   - Observing if there are any openings around the boulder to shift toward a different column (if permitted by the game mechanics) to navigate towards the goal more effectively.\n\n4. **Avoid the Hole**: The `hole` at (12, 3) is an imminent threat, so every effort must be made to prevent the avatar from moving down into it. \n\n5. **Goal-Oriented Movement**: Each move should prioritize reaching the goal located at (10, 7). After assessing potential push actions with the boulder, find the safest route while ensuring the goal priority is maintained.\n\nBy executing these strategies, the avatar will proceed with caution, taking the only available action while maintaining a clear plan to avoid hazards and work towards the goal.\n\n```**Move down to the boulder at (12, 2) and immediately assess options to maneuver safely around the hole without risking falling into it.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
