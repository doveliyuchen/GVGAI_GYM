It incorporates elements of strategy as players must navigate various sprites (obstacles and items) to achieve an objective.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game includes various static and dynamic objects. Key sprites include the avatar (player character), ground, goal, walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers.\n- **Interactions:** The interactions showcase various functionalities:\n  - The avatar must avoid certain sprites (like lasers and boulders) that can lead to a penalty or kill.\n  - Players can use boxes as shields and manipulate boulders strategically.\n- **Movement:** The avatar appears to bounce off boxes and step back when hitting walls or certain other sprites.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the goal ('0') while avoiding lethal sprites and utilizing the environment (like boxes and walls) to protect the avatar or create pathways.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal ('0') with the avatar. Achieving this may yield a score change (in this case, +5).\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is killed by lasers or loses all lives (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout, noting where dangerous sprites are located and how they interact with the avatar.\n2. **Use of Boxes:** Utilize boxes to shield against horizontal lasers and potentially manipulate boulders.\n3. **Avoid Lasers:** Be cautious regarding the placement and orientation of lasers; always approach them from a non-frontal angle to avoid immediate death.\n4. **Movement Planning:** Carefully plan your moves, especially in tight corridors. Avoid making hasty decisions, as certain sprites can cause you to step back or die unexpectedly.\n5. **Boulder Management:** Use boulders strategically to block paths or create pathways. Be aware of their interaction with holes which can cause both the boulder and the avatar to \"die\".\n\n### Conclusion\nSuccess in this game relies heavily on strategic movement planning, effective use of available objects (like boxes and walls), and a good understanding of the interaction mechanics between sprites. Solving the obstacles to successfully reach the goal while avoiding pitfalls requires both logical thinking and timing. Players should exercise caution as they navigate through deadly areas and should adapt their strategies based on the layout and the interactions of different sprites.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

It incorporates elements of strategy as players must navigate various sprites (obstacles and items) to achieve an objective.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game includes various static and dynamic objects. Key sprites include the avatar (player character), ground, goal, walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers.\n- **Interactions:** The interactions showcase various functionalities:\n  - The avatar must avoid certain sprites (like lasers and boulders) that can lead to a penalty or kill.\n  - Players can use boxes as shields and manipulate boulders strategically.\n- **Movement:** The avatar appears to bounce off boxes and step back when hitting walls or certain other sprites.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the goal ('0') while avoiding lethal sprites and utilizing the environment (like boxes and walls) to protect the avatar or create pathways.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal ('0') with the avatar. Achieving this may yield a score change (in this case, +5).\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is killed by lasers or loses all lives (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout, noting where dangerous sprites are located and how they interact with the avatar.\n2. **Use of Boxes:** Utilize boxes to shield against horizontal lasers and potentially manipulate boulders.\n3. **Avoid Lasers:** Be cautious regarding the placement and orientation of lasers; always approach them from a non-frontal angle to avoid immediate death.\n4. **Movement Planning:** Carefully plan your moves, especially in tight corridors. Avoid making hasty decisions, as certain sprites can cause you to step back or die unexpectedly.\n5. **Boulder Management:** Use boulders strategically to block paths or create pathways. Be aware of their interaction with holes which can cause both the boulder and the avatar to \"die\".\n\n### Conclusion\nSuccess in this game relies heavily on strategic movement planning, effective use of available objects (like boxes and walls), and a good understanding of the interaction mechanics between sprites. Solving the obstacles to successfully reach the goal while avoiding pitfalls requires both logical thinking and timing.
