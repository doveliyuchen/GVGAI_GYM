The core elements rely on manipulating the environment (like moving boxes and avoiding hazards) to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Environment**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and the goal are immovable elements that structure the level.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can be moved, while laser cannons and lasers are hazards that can deal damage.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites in specific ways, such as bouncing off boxes, being killed by lasers, or stepping back when hitting walls.\n   - Boulders can transform into moving missiles, and certain interactions can change the sprite state (e.g., from boulder to boulderm).\n   - Players gain points by successfully avoiding hazards and must navigate towards the goal.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a win when the avatar reaches the goal (indicated by the goal sprite) and a loss if the avatar is removed from the game (limit of 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective is to navigate the avatar through the level, overcoming obstacles and avoiding hazards to reach the goal. Players must also manage interactions with the environment, especially those involving the boulders, boxes, and lasers.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player successfully reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (by collisions with lasers or other environmental hazards), leading to a SpriteCounter limit of zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand Sprite Behavior**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with the avatar. Knowing that certain sprites can shield the avatar (e.g., boxes) while others can hurt (e.g., lasers, boulders) is critical.\n\n2. **Environmental Navigation**: Identify paths to the goal that minimize interactions with hazards. Use the layout of walls, holes, and moving entities to plan a safe route.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Leverage boxes to create barriers against lasers or to block pathways that would otherwise be hazardous. For example, position boxes to shield the avatar from frontal lasering.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulders Wisely**: Boulders can transition into hazards; therefore, use them deliberately to disable lasers or to draw them away from critical pathways.\n\n5. **Predict Enemy Movements**: If the game involves moving hazards or enemy sprites, try to predict their movements and find safe windows to traverse.\n\n6. **Test and Retry**: If obstacles seem insurmountable, don't hesitate to restart the level or try different tactics until you find a pathway to success.\n\n7. **Point Accumulation**: While reaching the goal grants points, gaining score through interactions with other sprites (such as pushing boulders or boxes) should be considered. This suggests the game may have a scoring component that could influence gameplay in a larger context (e.g., time limits or competition).\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of winning while effectively managing risk throughout the level. The combination of puzzle-solving and platform mechanics suggests a game that rewards both thoughtfulness and quick reflexes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Since the only option to proceed safely is to push the box back left to (row = 11, col = 1), I avoid moving right towards the hole. This action also plays into the existing strategy of box alignment to ensure a clear path forward.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nI will push the box back to the left (to (row = 11, col = 1)). This decision aligns with the box strategy of clearing pathways and optimizing movement toward the goal while ensuring safety from hazards. I expect this action will help create a better navigational layout in future turns.",

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Game Genre\nBased on the description of sprites, interactions, and the mechanics present, this game fits into the **puzzle/platformer** genre. The core elements rely on manipulating the environment (like moving boxes and avoiding hazards) to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Environment**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, walls, holes, and the goal are immovable elements that structure the level.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites**: Boxes and boulders can be moved, while laser cannons and lasers are hazards that can deal damage.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites in specific ways, such as bouncing off boxes, being killed by lasers, or stepping back when hitting walls.\n   - Boulders can transform into moving missiles, and certain interactions can change the sprite state (e.g., from boulder to boulderm).\n   - Players gain points by successfully avoiding hazards and must navigate towards the goal.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a win when the avatar reaches the goal (indicated by the goal sprite) and a loss if the avatar is removed from the game (limit of 0).\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective is to navigate the avatar through the level, overcoming obstacles and avoiding hazards to reach the goal. Players must also manage interactions with the environment, especially those involving the boulders, boxes, and lasers.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player successfully reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (by collisions with lasers or other environmental hazards), leading to a SpriteCounter limit of zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand Sprite Behavior**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with the avatar. Knowing that certain sprites can shield the avatar (e.g., boxes) while others can hurt (e.g., lasers, boulders) is critical.\n\n2. **Environmental Navigation**: Identify paths to the goal that minimize interactions with hazards. Use the layout of walls, holes, and moving entities to plan a safe route.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Leverage boxes to create barriers against lasers or to block pathways that would otherwise be hazardous. For example, position boxes to shield the avatar from frontal lasering.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulders Wisely**: Boulders can transition into hazards; therefore, use them deliberately to disable lasers or to draw them away from critical pathways.\n\n5. **Predict Enemy Movements**: If the game involves moving hazards or enemy sprites, try to predict their movements and find safe windows to traverse.\n\n6. **Test and Retry**: If obstacles seem insurmountable, don't hesitate to restart the level or try different tactics until you find a pathway to success.\n\n7. **Point Accumulation**: While reaching the goal grants points, gaining score through interactions with other sprites (such as pushing boulders or boxes) should be considered. This suggests the game may have a scoring component that could influence gameplay in a larger context (e.g., time limits or competition).\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of winning while effectively managing risk throughout the level. The combination of puzzle-solving and platform mechanics suggests a game that rewards both thoughtfulness and quick reflexes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'h'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 11, col = 2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**boulder strategy: Utilize boulders to block hazards and open pathways toward the goal, ensuring safer navigation through the area** without **Alert**\n\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
