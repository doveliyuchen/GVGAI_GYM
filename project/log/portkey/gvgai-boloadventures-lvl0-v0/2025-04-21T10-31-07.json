    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle platformer with elements of skill-based navigation and strategic interactions with various objects. The use of sprites, environmental obstacles, and the need to maneuver your avatar in complex layouts suggest that it is a platforming puzzle game.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n   - **Ground**: Provides a stable platform for movement.\n   - **Holes**: Acting as traps that can cause loss of a player or an object.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the endpoint that must be reached to win.\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player, which interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes and Boulder Mechanics**: Used for creating pathways, obstacles, or traps (manipulated to shield from lasers or serve as stepping stones).\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Indicate danger zones that can kill the avatar if approached incorrectly.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers influencing movement and strategies.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boulders, holes, and boxes.\n   - Movement mechanics include bouncing off of boxes, stepping back when colliding with walls, and transformations based on interactions with certain sprites.\n   - Taking damage from lasers depends on the avatar's orientation while in proximity (killIfFrontal or killIfNotFrontal).\n\n### Objectives\n- The objective of the game is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while navigating through the various obstacles presented in the level. The player scores points by reaching the goal or defeating specific sprites (like killing the avatar with the laser).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the \"goal\" sprite. In doing so, the player receives a score change of +5. The presence of the `SpriteCounter` for the goal suggests that upon reaching it, it is counted down to zero, indicating accomplishment.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is removed from the level by being killed (e.g., reaching a laser) or if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero as indicated by the `SpriteCounter`.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation and Planning**: Take time to observe the layout before attempting to move. Identify the locations of walls, holes, and lasers to plan your route carefully.\n2. **Box Manipulation**: Use the boxes strategically either to create pathways or as shields against the lasers while avoiding getting crushed by boulders. Move boxes to control the space effectively.\n3. **Avoid Lasers**: Keep track of laser orientations and move the avatar carefully to avoid getting killed, ensuring to face lasers only from the correct direction (i.e., frontal).\n4. **Use the Environment**: Leverage the immovable sprites (like walls) as barriers against dangers and utilize the boulders for effective blocking or creating new paths. Experiment with bouncing off boxes to navigate difficult areas.\n5. **Seek Power-ups**: If the game offers potential items or sprites that boost capabilities (like shields against lasers), prioritize their acquisition to facilitate navigation to the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires thoughtful strategy and precise control over your avatar while navigating through a perilous environment filled with obstacles and traps. The combination of puzzle mechanics and platforming skills establishes a challenging gaming experience, appealing to fans of the genre.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(y=11, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=0, x=0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Next Strategy: Push the Box\n\nGiven the current game state, the next logical strategy is to **push the box** in order to interact with it and potentially create a pathway or maneuver that leads towards the goal.\n\n**Warning:** If the game state remains unchanged after executing this strategy, it may be necessary for the agent to consider alternative actions. \n\n**Nearest Item to Interact With:** The nearest box is available for interaction, which should be prioritized as it will aid in progressing towards the goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The use of sprites, environmental obstacles, and the need to maneuver your avatar in complex layouts suggest that it is a platforming puzzle game.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n   - **Ground**: Provides a stable platform for movement.\n   - **Holes**: Acting as traps that can cause loss of a player or an object.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the endpoint that must be reached to win.\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player, which interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes and Boulder Mechanics**: Used for creating pathways, obstacles, or traps (manipulated to shield from lasers or serve as stepping stones).\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Indicate danger zones that can kill the avatar if approached incorrectly.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers influencing movement and strategies.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boulders, holes, and boxes.\n   - Movement mechanics include bouncing off of boxes, stepping back when colliding with walls, and transformations based on interactions with certain sprites.\n   - Taking damage from lasers depends on the avatar's orientation while in proximity (killIfFrontal or killIfNotFrontal).\n\n### Objectives\n- The objective of the game is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while navigating through the various obstacles presented in the level. The player scores points by reaching the goal or defeating specific sprites (like killing the avatar with the laser).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the \"goal\" sprite. In doing so, the player receives a score change of +5. The presence of the `SpriteCounter` for the goal suggests that upon reaching it, it is counted down to zero, indicating accomplishment.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is removed from the level by being killed (e.g., reaching a laser) or if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero as indicated by the `SpriteCounter`.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation and Planning**: Take time to observe the layout before attempting to move. Identify the locations of walls, holes, and lasers to plan your route carefully.\n2. **Box Manipulation**: Use the boxes strategically either to create pathways or as shields against the lasers while avoiding getting crushed by boulders. Move boxes to control the space effectively.\n3. **Avoid Lasers**: Keep track of laser orientations and move the avatar carefully to avoid getting killed, ensuring to face lasers only from the correct direction (i.e., frontal).\n4. **Use the Environment**: Leverage the immovable sprites (like walls) as barriers against dangers and utilize the boulders for effective blocking or creating new paths. Experiment with bouncing off boxes to navigate difficult areas.\n5. **Seek Power-ups**: If the game offers potential items or sprites that boost capabilities (like shields against lasers), prioritize their acquisition to facilitate navigation to the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires thoughtful strategy and precise control over your avatar while navigating through a perilous environment filled with obstacles and traps. The combination of puzzle mechanics and platforming skills establishes a challenging gaming experience, appealing to fans of the genre.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle platformer with elements of skill-based navigation and strategic interactions with various objects. The use of sprites, environmental obstacles, and the need to maneuver your avatar in complex layouts suggest that it is a platforming puzzle game.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n   - **Ground**: Provides a stable platform for movement.\n   - **Holes**: Acting as traps that can cause loss of a player or an object.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the endpoint that must be reached to win.\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player, which interacts with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes and Boulder Mechanics**: Used for creating pathways, obstacles, or traps (manipulated to shield from lasers or serve as stepping stones).\n   - **Lasercannons and Lasers**: Indicate danger zones that can kill the avatar if approached incorrectly.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers influencing movement and strategies.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boulders, holes, and boxes.\n   - Movement mechanics include bouncing off of boxes, stepping back when colliding with walls, and transformations based on interactions with certain sprites.\n   - Taking damage from lasers depends on the avatar's orientation while in proximity (killIfFrontal or killIfNotFrontal).\n\n### Objectives\n- The objective of the game is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while navigating through the various obstacles presented in the level. The player scores points by reaching the goal or defeating specific sprites (like killing the avatar with the laser).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the \"goal\" sprite. In doing so, the player receives a score change of +5. The presence of the `SpriteCounter` for the goal suggests that upon reaching it, it is counted down to zero, indicating accomplishment.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is removed from the level by being killed (e.g., reaching a laser) or if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero as indicated by the `SpriteCounter`.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation and Planning**: Take time to observe the layout before attempting to move. Identify the locations of walls, holes, and lasers to plan your route carefully.\n2. **Box Manipulation**: Use the boxes strategically either to create pathways or as shields against the lasers while avoiding getting crushed by boulders. Move boxes to control the space effectively.\n3. **Avoid Lasers**: Keep track of laser orientations and move the avatar carefully to avoid getting killed, ensuring to face lasers only from the correct direction (i.e., frontal).\n4. **Use the Environment**: Leverage the immovable sprites (like walls) as barriers against dangers and utilize the boulders for effective blocking or creating new paths. Experiment with bouncing off boxes to navigate difficult areas.\n5. **Seek Power-ups**: If the game offers potential items or sprites that boost capabilities (like shields against lasers), prioritize their acquisition to facilitate navigation to the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires thoughtful strategy and precise control over your avatar while navigating through a perilous environment filled with obstacles and traps. The combination of puzzle mechanics and platforming skills establishes a challenging gaming experience, appealing to fans of the genre.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(y=11, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Next Strategy: Push the Boulder\n\nGiven that the previous strategy did not achieve the desired progress, the next logical action is to **push the boulder** in order to manipulate the environment effectively. This action may help in creating a pathway or clearing an obstacle that allows for advancing toward the goal.\n\n**Warning:** If the game state remains unchanged after executing this strategy, it may be necessary for the agent to change its action.\n\n**Nearest Item to Interact With:** The nearest item relevant to this strategy is the boulder, which is essential for progressing through the level and facilitating movement toward the goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
