Players must navigate the level to collect opportunities that could lead to a successful conclusion while managing the threats posed by various sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The avatar successfully reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar is killed (by lasers or boulders), leading to game termination.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Mapping the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, and the placement of cannons. Understanding the levels can prevent premature deaths.\n  \n2. **Using Boxes and Boulders**: \n   - Utilize boxes as shields against lasers, knowing that they can also be moved.\n   - Be strategic in placing boulders since they can attract danger towards the player or block paths, but also allow for clever movement around obstacles.\n\n3. **Laser Management**: \n   - Ensure to avoid frontal engagement with lasers since the avatar will be killed instantly.\n   - Use the environment, such as walls and obstacles, to block or redirect laser paths.\n\n4. **Calculate Risks**: Before taking any action, consider the potential consequences, especially when pathways might lead to immediate dangers.\n\n5. **Explore Alternate Paths**: If you encounter a pattern that leads to danger, retrace your steps and seek alternative routes that may provide safer access to the goal.\n\nOverall, success will hinge on strategic movement, environmental manipulation, and tactical planning based on the various interactive elements present in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The goal will be to interact with the Laser Cannon mechanism in order to manage lasers on the playfield strategically. However, the avatar cannot directly reach the cannon due to adjacent walls.\n\n### Choice of Interaction:\nWhile the current state does not allow the avatar to reach an interactable object or move to a new position, the next best step is to assess an alternate pathway that could yield a consistent strategy while remaining cautious of what's immediately around.\n\nThe closer interaction would thus involve planning a route leading to a more accessible item like the **Boulder** (represented by *). However, this requires moving to a position where the boulders can be manipulated.\n\n### Reasoning for Current State:\n- **Blocked Movement**: The avatar is currently blocked by walls and cannot interact with the laser cannons. The holes and walls present barriers that restrict movement to potentially valuable interactables.\n  \n### Long-term Strategy:\nFocus on moving towards the nearest accessible item, which can manipulate or redirect obstacles and threats to reach the goal. In this case, the **Boulders** located near (6,1) and (6,2) could create a pathway or block dangerous areas.\n\n```**Move down to (5, 1) to interact with the Boulder, which may help in managing threats or opening up new paths.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Thus, the immediate next step must focus on identifying the closest interactive object (such as a boulder or other sprites) that could be used to escape a dead-end scenario.\n\n### Nearest Interactable Item:\nThe nearest interactable items are the **Boulders** ('*') located nearby:\n- **At (8, 1)** and **(8, 2)** on the left side of the current avatar position.\n\nGiven the restrictions from the walls, moving to (8, 1) or (8, 2) is not possible for the avatar currently situated at (10,0). \n\n### Reasoning for Current State:\n- **Blocked Movement**: The avatar cannot escape from the current position as all nearby options are walls, and the blocked pathways prevent interaction with any significant elements.\n\n### Strategy:\nFocus on moving toward the nearest interactable boulders once the avatar is in an open path. The current state limits movement from the wall. The next feasible approach is to prioritize a route toward the nearest boulders once those pathways are available.\n\n```**Wait for a future turn to maneuver toward the boulders at (8, 1) and (8, 2) as the next step after repositioning the avatar.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Essentially, the current state remains unchanged from the last analysis due to the walls.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe immediate plan must focus on waiting for an unseen state change or unblock access to the necessary boulders or further movements. However, as there are no actions available to proceed immediately, a strategy that evaluates the nearest boulders ('*') must be the focus when pathways become available. In the meantime, acknowledging that the state does not change means preparing for the next move as pathways open up in future turns.\n\n```**Wait for an opportunity to move towards the nearest boulders at (8, 1) and (8, 2) once pathways open.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
