Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

This location is surrounded by walls to the left and right represented by `*`, and there are several ground spaces around. The objective, represented by `$`, is located at (y=11, x=6). There are boxes and boulders nearby, which the avatar can potentially interact with, but it's crucial to assess the immediate interactions available to progress towards the goal.\n\n#### Immediate Surroundings:\n- To the right (at (y=11, x=2)) is an empty ground space `.`\n- Further right at (y=11, x=3) is a box `#`. \n- Beyond that (at (y=11, x=4) and (y=11, x=5)) are more ground spaces `.`\n- The goal is at (y=11, x=6), immediately after the ground spaces.\n\n### Available Interactions\n1. **Moving Right to Interact with Box `#`**: The avatar can move right to (11, 2) and (11, 3) to eventually reach the box at (11, 3). Moving onto the box or pushing it could be a strategic advancement towards the goal.\n  \n2. **Pushing Box `#`**: If the avatar occupies (11, 3) and pushes the box, the box would move to (11, 2) or (11, 4), depending on the push direction. This could help clear the area to reach the goal.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the analysis, the most effective step is to move right and begin interacting with the box to set up a pathway towards the goal.\n\n```**Move right to (y=11, x=2) and then right again to (y=11, x=3) to interact with the box (#) for potential movement towards the goal ($).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding area presents the following configuration:\n\n- Directly above (y=10, x=2) is a wall (`b`), blocking upward movement.\n- Below (y=12, x=2) is also a wall (`b`), blocking downward movement.\n- To the left (y=11, x=1) is a wall (`b`), blocking leftward movement.\n- To the right (y=11, x=3) is an empty ground space (`.`).\n- Further right (y=11, x=4) is a box (`#`), which can be pushed.\n- The goal ('$') is at (y=11, x=6), which is reachable if the obstacles in between are navigated effectively.\n\nIn essence, as it stands, there are no immediate options to move left, up, or down, leaving only rightward movement toward the box (y=11, x=3) a viable option.\n\n### Available Interactions\n1. **Moving Right (to (y=11, x=3))**: The avatar can move right to (y=11, x=3) where the box is located. Pushing the box will serve as the primary action to clear a path towards the goal.\n2. **Pushing the Box (#)**: Once at (y=11, x=3), the avatar can push the box either to (y=11, x=4) or behind it to (y=11, x=2). This clear path could subsequently be followed to continue towards the goal.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven that the avatar is confined with walls on three sides, the only strategic movement is to push the box rightwards to eventually reach the goal. \n\n```**Move right to (y=11, x=3) and push the box (#) towards the goal to create a clear path.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The surrounding tiles are as follows:\n\n- **Left (y=11, x=1):** Wall (`b`), blocking movement left.\n- **Right (y=11, x=3):** Ground (`.`), allowing movement into this space.\n- **Up (y=10, x=2):** Wall (`b`), blocking upward movement.\n- **Down (y=12, x=2):** Wall (`b`), blocking downward movement.\n\nThis means the only available movement option is to the right into (y=11, x=3).\n\n### Available Interactions\n1. **Moving Right to (y=11, x=3):** The avatar can move into this ground space.\n2. **Pushing the Box (#) at (y=11, x=4):** Once the avatar moves to (y=11, x=3), it will be perfectly positioned to push the box located at (y=11, x=4) on the following turn.\n\n### Objective Clarification\nThe goal sprite (`$`) is located at (y=11, x=6). To successfully reach this goal, the avatar must take the following actions:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Move to the right into (y=11, x=3).\n2. **Step 2:** On the next turn, push the box from (y=11, x=4) to (y=11, x=5), which will then clear the path to the goal.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\nConsidering the analysis above, the best course of action is to move right into the available space. This will set up the necessary action to push the box in the subsequent turn.\n\n```**Move right to (y=11, x=3) to prepare for pushing the box (#) on the next turn towards the goal ($) at (y=11, x=6).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Given the strategic nature of the interactions, obstacles, and objectives, it may also feature elements common in **platformer** games due to the avatar's movement and the environmental hazards (like lasers and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Interactions**: The game employs various sprites (ground, hole, goal, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers) that interact in complex ways. The interactions suggest physics-based gameplay where pushing and bouncing are crucial to navigate the environment.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other objects, and has constraints such as being blocked by walls or harmed by lasers.\n- **Score System**: Points can be scored by interacting with certain sprites, particularly through the goal achievement and eliminating obstacles.\n  \n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite while avoiding obstacles and enemies (lasers, boulders).\n- Points may be accumulated through various interactions such as successfully avoiding traps or destroying certain sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which contributes to scoring.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is completely eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This can occur due to collisions with traps or hazards like lasers or being crushed by boulders.\n\n### Strategies:\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout from the level map to anticipate where hazards and goals are, allowing for a strategic plan of movement.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can shield the avatar from lasers (as per the `avatar box > shieldFrom ftype=killIfFrontal stype=laser` interaction). Use this to create safe pathways through laser traps.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Learn to control the boulder interactions. You can push boulders into certain positions to create barriers or clear paths. Pay attention to how boulders interact differently with walls, boxes, and the avatar.\n   \n4. **Avoid Laser Cannons**: Plan your movements carefully to avoid direct confrontations with lasers. The laser has a specific directionality; if not approached head-on, it can be avoided. Use boxes strategically to shield your avatar while moving past these dangers.\n\n5. **Leverage Points**: Aim to maximize the score by targeting situations that will both progress towards the goal and yield points from traps or other interactive sprites.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the various interactions and potential hazards, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of movements and interactions. Understanding the consequences of each action will enhance your strategic approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game presents a fascinating blend of strategic interactions and environmental puzzles centered around navigation and obstacle avoidance. By using the environment effectively and understanding the interactions between sprites, players can optimize their play to reach the goal while maximizing points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.
