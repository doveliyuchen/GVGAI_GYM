Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards. By leveraging mechanics effectively and planning moves, players can navigate to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards. By leveraging mechanics effectively and planning moves, players can navigate to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards.

Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards. By leveraging mechanics effectively and planning moves, players can navigate to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards.

Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards. By leveraging mechanics effectively and planning moves, players can navigate to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards.

Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, as well as win/loss conditions and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits within the **Puzzle-Platformer** genre. It involves navigating through a level while solving a variety of environmental puzzles and using platforming skills to advance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent elements of the game world:\n   - **Immovable Sprites** (e.g., wall, ground, goal): These cannot be moved, setting the boundaries and layout of the level.\n   - **Passive Sprites** (e.g., box, boulder): These can be pushed or interacted with to influence gameplay.\n   - **Missiles** (e.g., laser, boulderm): These can actively harm the player or other sprites.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for various interactions:\n   - **Collision-based**: The avatar can step back from walls and other sprites, indicating non-linear movement.\n   - **Transformations**: Different states (e.g., boulderm from boulder) suggest physics-driven mechanics.\n   - **Killing conditions**: Collisions with lasers or holes can result in eliminating the avatar, making positioning critical.\n   - **Score Changes**: Players can score points by reaching the goal or utilizing other interactions effectively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal sprite**, which yields a score change of +5. Along the way, players must avoid hazards like lasers and holes while managing interactions with boxes, boulders, and other game elements.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You **lose** if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (the avatar is eliminated).\n- You **win** if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (the avatar successfully reaches the goal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each interaction can affect the avatar's path. Moving a box or boulder can create a safer route or obstruct hazards temporarily.\n\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Pay attention to the positioning of lasers and holes. Since the avatar can be killed by a laser in both frontal and non-frontal collisions, always approach with caution.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**: Leverage the boxes to create shields against lasers or to redirect hazards. Interact with the environment smartly to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Be aware of the level layout. Ensure that movements do not lead to places where the avatar can become trapped between obstacles without escape routes.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Since interactions may create opportunities for points (e.g., encountering the goal), try to maximize your score through careful planning and utilizing the environmental mechanics efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and Learn**: If you encounter a failure, break down what went wrong and where placement of blocks or movement strategies could be improved.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this puzzle-platformer game emphasizes careful interaction, strategic movement, and environmental manipulation to achieve the goal while avoiding hazards. By leveraging mechanics effectively and planning moves, players can navigate to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbbbb.*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbbbb.*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbbbb.*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbbbb.*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*.a*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=2, x=2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nNext, push the box '#' upwards to create a clearer pathway for the avatar 'a' to advance toward the goal '$', and be ready to change your action if the surrounding situation does not change.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
