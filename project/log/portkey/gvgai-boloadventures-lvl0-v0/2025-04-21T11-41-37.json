Players likely navigate a series of levels by avoiding obstacles and utilizing interactions within the environment to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites such as ground, walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, wall, hole, and goal represent static elements in the environment.\n  - **Passive Objects**: Boxes and boulders that can interact with the avatar and other sprites.\n  - **Active Sprites**: The laser and boulders can pose threats or obstacles based on their interactions with the avatar.\n  \n- **Avatar**: The player's character (the \"avatar\") has various interactions with the environment. The avatar can move, bounce off boxes, and potentially be transformed or killed based on interactions with other sprites like boulders and lasers.\n\n- **Laser Cannons**: These introduce dynamic hazards that require the player to avoid or shield against attacks, adding a layer of strategy to movement.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards and ensuring the avatar survives. Scoring is tied to interactions, particularly:\n- Achieving a score change through certain actions (e.g., killing sprites or reaching the goal).\n- Maximizing the score while ensuring the avatar does not reach a \"SpriteCounter limit\" which would denote a loss condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar interacts with the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), leading to a score increase.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's \"SpriteCounter\" limit reaches zero (`limit=0 win=False`), which suggests that the avatar's existence might be tied to avoiding deaths.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the positions of walls, holes, lasers, and boulders. Move strategically to avoid being hit by lasers and to prevent falling into holes. \n\n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Wisely**: Utilize passive sprites (boxes and boulders) to create paths or shields. For instance, bouncing off boxes can navigate around walls. \n\n3. **Careful Movement**: Since collisions with boulders and lasers can be fatal, cautiously plan movements. Take note of how your avatar reacts to various interactions (step back, forward, attract gaze, etc.).\n\n4. **Plan Ahead for Lasers**: The dynamic nature of the laser cannons means players should anticipate movement patterns and potential placements. Moving cautiously in their vicinity will be crucial.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Focus on reaching the goal to maximize score while also looking for opportunities to increase score through interactions (such as the interactions with boulders and holes).\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions**: Some mechanics suggest that players can undo certain actions. Experimenting with various combinations of interactions can lead to successful outcomes.\n\nIn essence, the player must combine careful navigation, strategic thinking regarding object interaction, and awareness of hazards to successfully reach the goal and maximize score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The surrounding environment consists primarily of walls, with various interactable objects like boulders and boxes positioned away from the avatar's immediate vicinity.\n\n**Current Avatar Position Analysis**\n- **Walls**: The avatar is surrounded by walls, limiting its movement options. Moving right leads into a hole, which is not favorable.\n- **Interactable Items**: The nearest items are boulders and a box, located further down the level. The boulder seems more strategically beneficial for later moves as it can potentially be used to clear paths.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\n1. **Immediate Threat**: The hole to the right prevents movement in that direction, so it is essential to identify alternative pathways or interactions.\n   \n2. **Assess Interactable Items**: \n   - **Boulders**: These can be useful for both redirecting movement and obstructing hazards later.\n   - **Box**: Also a potential item for bouncing or connecting pathways.\n\n3. **Movement Options**: Since the current position is restricted, the avatar should consider moving vertically or in other directions where interactions can be initiated.\n\n### Next Action\n\nGiven that a direct move into the hole is blocked, the best course of action is to look at what item can be engaged to set up for a future move.\n\nThe nearest boulder at (5, 3) and (6, 3) can be utilized strategically:\n- Create a path towards the goal by planning to manipulate the boulders in the upcoming moves in further turns.\n\n### Final Strategy Statement\n\nGiven the analysis, the avatar should take the following action:\n\n```**Move down (to (1, 1)) to engage with more potential interactable items while avoiding the hole and limited movement options.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding area does not allow for direct movement into either the hole or the next viable paths.\n\n1. **Immediate Threats**: The hole on the right is not a valid move since stepping into a hole would result in a negative outcome.\n2. **Environment Composition**: The walls make movement options very limited. The only viable moves are to explore below (downward) where there are potential boulders and boxes available.\n   \n3. **Potential Moves**: The next viable move should allow the avatar to explore options for interaction with nearby items.\n\n### Item Interaction Review\n\n1. **Boulders**: The boulders appear further down the path. However, the path to access them is blocked by walls and therefore cannot be accessed immediately. \n2. **Box**: There is a box nearby (at coordinates (5, 3)), but the path to it is also blocked. The nearest boulder at (3, 3) is farther down from the avatar's current location.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\nThe avatar can consider moving downward to potentially access spaces where it can later interact with boulders or manipulate other elements to progress through the level.\n\n### Path Forward\n\nSince the current state blocks immediate interactions but reveals potential next steps if the avatar moves downwards:\n- The best course is to simply move down (to (1, 1)) as it will not directly approach the hole nor move further into walls, allowing options for future interactions.\n\n### Final Strategy Statement\n\nGiven the analysis of the current state, the strategy for the next step is as follows:\n\n```**Move down (to (1, 1)) to open up more routes for potential interactions with items and avoid the hole.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate environment is restrictive, primarily composed of walls, with limited potential for immediate movement or interaction.\n\n1. **Immediate Threats**: The hole (0, 2) directly adjacent to the avatar makes movement to the right untenable. The surrounding walls further restrict movement.\n   \n2. **Potential for Interaction**: Directly below the current position, however, is (1, 1), which remains an accessible position, and there are more options opened up in future moves should the avatar take this path.\n\n### Next Steps to Take\n\nThe nearby interactable items consist of:\n- **Boulders** further along the level.\n- **Box** positioned at (5, 3) in the lower part of the layout, but access to it is also blocked currently.\n\nNeither of these items can be engaged directly from the current position due to wall constraints.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\nGiven the limitations, the best immediate step is to move down to (1, 1). This will:\n- Provide more access to further pathways.\n- Open up the possibility of exploring interactions with nearby boulders in subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the avatar can't move into the hole or continue right due to the wall and another hole, the logical action is downwards where further routes may become available for interaction.\n\n### Final Strategy Statement\n\nThus, the strategy for the next step is as follows:\n\n```**Move down (to (1, 1)) to explore more viable pathways and set up for future interactions with additional items.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Players likely navigate a series of levels by avoiding obstacles and utilizing interactions within the environment to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites such as ground, walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, wall, hole, and goal represent static elements in the environment.\n  - **Passive Objects**: Boxes and boulders that can interact with the avatar and other sprites.\n  - **Active Sprites**: The laser and boulders can pose threats or obstacles based on their interactions with the avatar.\n  \n- **Avatar**: The player's character (the \"avatar\") has various interactions with the environment.

The immediate surroundings are comprised entirely of walls except for the area below it. Notably, the avatar's possible actions are limited because:\n\n1. **Wall** to the left (0, 0)\n2. **Wall** above (0, 2), leading to a hole that cannot be traversed.\n3. **Wall** below (1, 1), which blocks downward movement.\n4. **Wall** right at (0, 2), which leads to a hole that would cause a negative outcome.\n\nTherefore, the avatar is currently stuck in a position with no immediate paths available.\n\n### Potential Interactions\nThe nearest accessible items, while unreachable in the immediate next move, are:\n1. **Boxes** located further down (around (5, 3)).\n2. **Boulders** which could potentially be used for interactions, but they are also blocked by walls from the current location.\n\n### Reasoning About Movement Options\nGiven the state:\n- All paths around the avatar are blocked by walls or lead into a hole.\n- The best approach considers moving down to open avenues for future actions.\n\n### Strategy Outline\n\nSince immediate movement options lead to a wall or a hole, the best alternative step is to strategically analyze the next available move, which involves exploring downward to (1, 1) for possible interactions in future turns with the environment.\n\n### Final Strategy Statement\nThus, based on the analysis of the current position and the surrounding constraints, the strategy for the next step is:\n\n```**Move down (to (1, 1)) to unlock further pathways and options for interacting with nearby boulders and boxes in subsequent turns.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the avatar\u2019s environment:\n\n1. **Current Surroundings**:\n   - **Left**: Wall at (0, 0) \n   - **Above**: Wall at (-1, 1) (not traversable)\n   - **Right**: Wall at (0, 2) which is a hole (not traversable).\n   - **Below**: Wall at (1, 1) (not traversable).\n\nOverall, the avatar has no viable moves from its current position due to walls and the adjacent hole.\n\n### Potential Interactions\nThe following items are located in the game but are inaccessible from the current position:\n1. **Box**: Located at (5, 3).\n2. **Boulder**: Located at (3, 3).\n\n### Evaluation of Movement Options\nGiven the position and immediate surroundings:\n- The avatar cannot move left, right, up, or down.\n- All paths are blocked by walls or the hole, which limits any possible interaction with objects in the game.\n\n### Next Action\nSince no movements are possible from the current position, the focus should shift to planning potential future interactions:\n1. Exploring down to (1, 1) would have provided access to paths towards items.\n2. Unfortunately, since everything is blocked, the strategy must focus on preparing for future availability of routes.\n\n### Final Strategy Summary\nSince the current state allows for no feasible movements, the suggestion is directed towards awareness of future circumstances. The lack of any possible action leads to the identification that no interactable items are accessible currently, and thus moving down will not help.\n\nIn light of the state remaining unchanged and there being no potential to move or interact, the strategy will involve preparing for anticipating future moves.\n\n### Final Strategy Statement\nTaking into account the current constraints around the avatar:\n\n```**Identify the nearest interactable item and plan to move towards it once paths become available. Since no action can be taken now, focus on evaluating future moves instead.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Players likely navigate a series of levels by avoiding obstacles and utilizing interactions within the environment to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites such as ground, walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, wall, hole, and goal represent static elements in the environment.\n  - **Passive Objects**: Boxes and boulders that can interact with the avatar and other sprites.\n  - **Active Sprites**: The laser and boulders can pose threats or obstacles based on their interactions with the avatar.\n  \n- **Avatar**: The player's character (the \"avatar\") has various interactions with the environment. The avatar can move, bounce off boxes, and potentially be transformed or killed based on interactions with other sprites like boulders and lasers.\n\n- **Laser Cannons**: These introduce dynamic hazards that require the player to avoid or shield against attacks, adding a layer of strategy to movement.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards and ensuring the avatar survives. Scoring is tied to interactions, particularly:\n- Achieving a score change through certain actions (e.g., killing sprites or reaching the goal).\n- Maximizing the score while ensuring the avatar does not reach a \"SpriteCounter limit\" which would denote a loss condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar interacts with the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), leading to a score increase.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's \"SpriteCounter\" limit reaches zero (`limit=0 win=False`), which suggests that the avatar's existence might be tied to avoiding deaths.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the positions of walls, holes, lasers, and boulders. Move strategically to avoid being hit by lasers and to prevent falling into holes. \n\n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Wisely**: Utilize passive sprites (boxes and boulders) to create paths or shields. For instance, bouncing off boxes can navigate around walls. \n\n3. **Careful Movement**: Since collisions with boulders and lasers can be fatal, cautiously plan movements. Take note of how your avatar reacts to various interactions (step back, forward, attract gaze, etc.).\n\n4. **Plan Ahead for Lasers**: The dynamic nature of the laser cannons means players should anticipate movement patterns and potential placements. Moving cautiously in their vicinity will be crucial.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Focus on reaching the goal to maximize score while also looking for opportunities to increase score through interactions (such as the interactions with boulders and holes).\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions**: Some mechanics suggest that players can undo certain actions. Experimenting with various combinations of interactions can lead to successful outcomes.\n\nIn essence, the player must combine careful navigation, strategic thinking regarding object interaction, and awareness of hazards to successfully reach the goal and maximize score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Take note of how your avatar reacts to various interactions (step back, forward, attract gaze, etc.).\n\n4. **Plan Ahead for Lasers**: The dynamic nature of the laser cannons means players should anticipate movement patterns and potential placements. Moving cautiously in their vicinity will be crucial.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Focus on reaching the goal to maximize score while also looking for opportunities to increase score through interactions (such as the interactions with boulders and holes).\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions**: Some mechanics suggest that players can undo certain actions. Experimenting with various combinations of interactions can lead to successful outcomes.\n\nIn essence, the player must combine careful navigation, strategic thinking regarding object interaction, and awareness of hazards to successfully reach the goal and maximize score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Players likely navigate a series of levels by avoiding obstacles and utilizing interactions within the environment to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites such as ground, walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Ground, wall, hole, and goal represent static elements in the environment.\n  - **Passive Objects**: Boxes and boulders that can interact with the avatar and other sprites.\n  - **Active Sprites**: The laser and boulders can pose threats or obstacles based on their interactions with the avatar.\n  \n- **Avatar**: The player's character (the \"avatar\") has various interactions with the environment. The avatar can move, bounce off boxes, and potentially be transformed or killed based on interactions with other sprites like boulders and lasers.\n\n- **Laser Cannons**: These introduce dynamic hazards that require the player to avoid or shield against attacks, adding a layer of strategy to movement.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards and ensuring the avatar survives. Scoring is tied to interactions, particularly:\n- Achieving a score change through certain actions (e.g., killing sprites or reaching the goal).\n- Maximizing the score while ensuring the avatar does not reach a \"SpriteCounter limit\" which would denote a loss condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar interacts with the goal sprite (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), leading to a score increase.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's \"SpriteCounter\" limit reaches zero (`limit=0 win=False`), which suggests that the avatar's existence might be tied to avoiding deaths.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the positions of walls, holes, lasers, and boulders. Move strategically to avoid being hit by lasers and to prevent falling into holes. \n\n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Wisely**: Utilize passive sprites (boxes and boulders) to create paths or shields. For instance, bouncing off boxes can navigate around walls. \n\n3. **Careful Movement**: Since collisions with boulders and lasers can be fatal, cautiously plan movements. Take note of how your avatar reacts to various interactions (step back, forward, attract gaze, etc.).\n\n4. **Plan Ahead for Lasers**: The dynamic nature of the laser cannons means players should anticipate movement patterns and potential placements.

The immediate surroundings show the following details:\n\n- **Left (0, 0)**: Wall\n- **Right (0, 2)**: Wall leading to a hole, which is not a valid move.\n- **Above (-1, 1)**: Out of bounds (invalid move).\n- **Below (1, 1)**: Wall\n\nAs such, every direction is blocked, preventing any movement from the current position.\n\n### Potential Interactable Items\nCurrently, the environment includes:\n- **Boulders** at (3, 3) and (4, 3), both of which are unreachable due to the walls.\n- **Box** at (5, 3), also unreachable from the current position.\n\nDespite the resources available within the level, no items can be accessed due to the constraints on movement.\n\n### Movement Options\nGiven the analysis above:\n- Moving left results in collision with a wall.\n- Moving to the right leads into a hole.\n- Moving down is blocked by a wall.\n- Moving up is out of bounds.\n\n### Reasoning\nThe avatar is completely trapped with no legal movement options. This situation means that the avatar must wait for the game environment to change in a future turn, allowing for movement possibilities.\n\n### Future Strategy Planning\nSince the current state leaves no options for immediate action or interaction, the focus should shift to preparing for the potential movement once the state changes. This preparation could involve strategizing on how to interact with boxes or boulders encountered after a downward move becoming available.\n\n### Final Strategy Statement\nGiven the overall constraints allowing no movement or interaction, the strategy from this position should be:\n\n```**Acknowledge that the current position is entirely blocked by walls and a hole, preventing movement or interaction. Wait for future moves to open up potential pathways toward interactable items once they're reachable.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
