The game involves maneuvering a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles and using different sprites (objects) to overcome challenges and reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Interactions:**\n  - Multiple types of sprites interact with each other in various ways, such as bouncing, shielding, and transforming.\n  - The avatar can interact with boulders, walls, holes, and boxes in specific manners that affect movement and protection or lead to consequences like death from lasers.\n  \n- **Player Interaction:**\n  - The player controls the avatar to navigate the environment.\n  - The avatar can sustain interactions with walls, boxes (for bouncing), and hazards (like lasers).\n  - There are moving elements (such as lasers and boulders) that react differently based on the avatar's movements.\n  \n- **Collision and Effects:**\n  - Certain interactions can result in the avatar being killed ('killIfFrontal' and 'killIfNotFrontal' interactions with lasers), while others yield positive impacts, such as gaining points or advancing the game (reaching the goal).\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objectives of the game are:\n- **Reach the Goal:** The player's primary aim is to reach the goal sprite (`goal avatar`), which results in the player winning and scoring points (5 points).\n- **Avoid Hazards:** The player must avoid being killed by lasers or falling into holes, which would prevent them from successfully completing the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they can reach the goal and destroy it, as indicated by the `goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches 0, which indicates that the avatar has been killed.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Assess the Environment:** Start by analyzing the level layout to understand where walls, holes, and boulders are located.\n2. **Utilize Boxes:** Use boxes strategically to bounce off of walls or to create a shield against frontal hazards like lasers. The application of boxes seems crucial in avoiding death while maneuvering.\n3. **Avoid Lasers and Holes:** Be cautious of laser directions and the location of holes. Trail around them where feasible, utilizing terrain to shield oneself from lasers or to redirect their paths using other sprites.\n4. **Plan Moves:** Since there seem to be various interactions based on relative sprite positioning, the player should plan each move in relation to potential hazards and objectives to ensure they do not inadvertently cause a death or set themselves up in an unfavorable position.\n5. **Leverage Score Changes:** If possible, aim to maximize score changes in the process to facilitate progress in the game while reaching the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid obstacles, and achieve victory by reaching the goal while remaining aware of the dangers presented by lasers and other sprites.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

However, to progress towards the goal, the best course of action involves manipulating items nearby to reach the goal efficiently.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe ultimate goal is to reach the goal sprite (`$`), which is located at (y=11, x=11). To achieve this, the avatar needs to navigate through obstacles, avoid hazards, and interact with objects as necessary.\n\n### Item of Interaction\n\nIn the current position, since the avatar can't immediately interact with items like boxes or boulders due to walls surrounding it, the focus shifts toward the nearest beneficial action. The next step is to move downward into the space at (y=1, x=1).\n\n### Reasoning for Next Step\n\nMoving to the empty space at (y=1, x=1) opens up additional movement options for the avatar, potentially leading to paths where boulders or boxes can be manipulated in future turns. Since this space does not contain any hazards, it is safe for the next action.\n\n### Summary of Strategy\n\nThe best recommended action at this point is to move downwards to (y=1, x=1) in order to explore more of the environment and get closer to potential interactable items later on.\n\n```**move down into the empty space (y=1, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

From this location, the surroundings are as follows:\n\n- Up (y=-1, x=1): wall (*)\n- Down (y=1, x=1): empty space (.)\n- Left (y=0, x=0): wall (*)\n- Right (y=0, x=2): empty space (.)\n\n### Objective Overview\n\nThe primary goal of the game is to reach the goal sprite (`$`), which is situated at (y=11, x=11). The pathway to the goal is obstructed by walls and hazards like holes, requiring careful maneuvering through the environment.\n\n### Nearest Interactable Items\n\nGiven the current constraint of the avatar being surrounded by walls and facing limited movement options, the nearest interactable item is at (y=1, x=1)\u2014an empty space directly below the avatar. However, this does not present an actionable object for the avatar to manipulate.\n\n### Next Action Strategy\n\nSince the avatar is currently boxed in with walls to the left and above, and the nearest empty space below does not contain an interactable item, the most plausible action is to move down into the empty space at (y=1, x=1). Moving down will open up more possible movements in subsequent turns, allowing the avatar to navigate further through the area.\n\n### Summary of Reasoning\n\nAt this moment, the avatar has limited options due to walls confining its position. However, moving down to the unblocked path will enable continued exploration and access to new interactions in upcoming moves. It is therefore essential to create opportunities for future actions, especially considering that the next steps afterward may involve pushing boxes or maneuvering past boulders.\n\n```**move down into the empty space (y=1, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

To navigate successfully toward this endpoint, the avatar must find a way around walls and other obstructions.\n\n### Nearest Interactable Items\n\nThe options for immediate interaction are limited:\n- Both left and up positions are walls and therefore impassable.\n- Directly below (y=1, x=1) is an open space.\n- To the right (y=0, x=2) is also an open space.\n\nHowever, both immediate adjacent spaces do not contain any significant interactive objects like boxes or boulders, meaning any movement will primarily serve to gain access to other potential paths.\n\n### Next Action Strategy\n\nWith the avatar currently surrounded by walls, the most effective action is to move down into the space at (y=1, x=1). This move does not lead to a direct interaction, but it expands the avatar's potential movements in the next turn. Moving down opens up further exploration downwards or to the right as the next step.\n\n### Reasoning for the Next Step\n\nProceeding downward clears the way for future movements without immediate danger. It is essential to create options for moving toward the goal in subsequent turns, especially when the other directions are blocked by walls.\n\n### Summary of Strategy\n\nConsidering the current constraints and surroundings, moving down into the open space will set the avatar on a better trajectory toward reaching reachable items and navigating past obstacles, including walls and ultimately the goal.\n\n```**move down into the empty space (y=1, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The closest empty spaces (down and right) provide opportunities to explore other regions of the map.\n\n### Strategy Discussion\n\nSince the avatar cannot interact with any visible items and is confined by walls to its left and above, the most logical move is to go down to (y=1, x=1). This will open up more potential paths in the next turn. \n\n- **Down (y=1, x=1)**: This space is clear and will provide a safe area to explore further options afterward.\n- **Right (y=0, x=2)**: This space is also empty but does not lead to any further immediate interaction with any items.\n\nIn summary, moving down will allow continued advancement toward navigating toward the goal located at (y=11, x=11) while avoiding getting stuck in confined areas.\n\n### Reasoning for Next Step\n\nMoving down opens additional pathways for exploration. This movement seems optimal because it allows for continued engagement with the game without encountering immediate walls or hazards. The goal is to find a more favorable route eventually leading toward the goal sprite.\n\n### Summary of Strategy\n\nGiven the constraints and objectives, an effective action is to move down into the empty space at (y=1, x=1), creating a pathway for subsequent moves.\n\n```**move down into the empty space (y=1, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Trail around them where feasible, utilizing terrain to shield oneself from lasers or to redirect their paths using other sprites.\n4. **Plan Moves:** Since there seem to be various interactions based on relative sprite positioning, the player should plan each move in relation to potential hazards and objectives to ensure they do not inadvertently cause a death or set themselves up in an unfavorable position.\n5. **Leverage Score Changes:** If possible, aim to maximize score changes in the process to facilitate progress in the game while reaching the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, the player can effectively navigate the level, avoid obstacles, and achieve victory by reaching the goal while remaining aware of the dangers presented by lasers and other sprites.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, you dont need to fully follow him. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*.a*\n*%%..........*......*..*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*.a*\n*%%..........*......*..*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Current Location Analysis\n\nThe avatar (`a`) is currently located at (y=0, x=1). The surrounding positions are analyzed as follows:\n\n- **Up (y=-1, x=1)**: wall (`b`)\n- **Down (y=1, x=1)**: empty space (.)\n- **Left (y=0, x=0)**: wall (`b`)\n- **Right (y=0, x=2)**: empty space (.)\n\n### Action and Strategy Overview\n\nThe goal of the game is to navigate toward the goal sprite (`$`), which is located at (y=1, x=11). The nearest interactable spaces available to the avatar are empty spaces below and to the right. However, there are no boxes or boulders nearby to interact with immediately. \n\n### Potential Movements\n\nThe available movements are:\n1. **Down (to (y=1, x=1))**: This space is clear and allows for further exploration.\n2. **Right (to (y=0, x=2))**: This space is also empty but does not provide immediate interaction opportunities.\n\nGiven that both movements do not directly lead to creating impactful interactions with items, the move downward into the open space would facilitate more options in the following turn.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Movement\n\nMoving downward (to (y=1, x=1)) opens up the possibility for better exploration of the area, as it allows access to the next lower row where there could be opportunities to influence the state of objects on the board.\n\n### Summary of Reasoning for Next Step\n\nMoving down is preferable as it does not confine the avatar's movement options going forward and enables the avatar to explore potential paths leading toward the goal. Right also offers options but is more limited in its potential for fruitful challenges. The goal is to increase movement freedom and thus maintain strategic advantage in progressing towards the ultimate goal!\n\n### Final Strategy \n\nTo summarize, the next action for the avatar, considering its current position and objectives, is:\n\n```**move down into the empty space (y=1, x=1)**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
