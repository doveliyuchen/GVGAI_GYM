    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game falls under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players need to navigate through a level using various interactive elements (such as boxes and lasers) to reach the goal while overcoming obstacles and using logical reasoning to complete the puzzles.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game contains various sprites, including the player avatar, ground, walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers. Each type of sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n- **Interactions**: The interactions indicate how different sprites interact with one another, such as:\n  - The avatar can manipulate boxes to shield against lasers, transform boulders, and step back from walls.\n  - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction and positioning.\n  - Boulders and boxes can collide with other sprites, affecting gameplay.\n- **Movement**: The avatar has limited moves and must navigate through the environment, avoiding obstacles to reach the goal.\n- **Score System**: Players can gain score points by performing certain interactions, such as reaching the goal or killing specific sprites.\n\n### Objectives\nThe player's main objective is to guide the avatar to reach the **goal** represented by the 'goal' sprite while managing interactions with other sprites effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (scoreChange=5).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably when the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit = 0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understand Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how different entities interact, particularly focusing on the boulders, lasers, and walls. This knowledge can help avoid traps and leverage the mechanics to your advantage.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Boxes can act as shields against lasers. Players should move boxes strategically to protect the avatar while navigating through the level.\n\n3. **Plan Movement**: Do not rush; analyze potential paths, especially when lasers are involved. Moving incrementally and considering each action's consequences can prevent instant failure.\n\n4. **Exploit Boulders and Holes**: Try using boulders wisely to open pathways or eliminate threats. Make sure not to over-depend on them, as their interactions can lead to other unexpected results.\n\n5. **Evaluate Safety**: Always assess the surrounding area for possible threats (like lasers coming from the lasercannon) before moving. Utilize the step-back movement to reset positioning when necessary.\n\n6. **Aim for High Scores**: If possible, engage in actions that grant points, like successfully killing threatening sprites, while still keeping a focus on reaching the goal.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: Given the puzzle elements, some scenarios might require experimentation to discover successful strategies and interactions.\n\n### Game Level Layout\nThis level layout features walls and various interactive elements, with optimal paths to navigate towards the goal while avoiding hazards. The layout suggests a need for careful maneuvering to avoid boulders activated by the avatar and effectively navigating through lasers.\n\nIn summary, this puzzle/platformer demands strategic movement and understanding of interactions among various sprites while avoiding dangers and leveraging the environment to reach the goal successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n@\nc\n#\nd\n$\ne\nb\n*\nf\n%\n&\ng\n@\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nBased on the provided state of the game, here's a high-level strategy for the next steps, incorporating an analysis of the current levels, the environment, and potential player interactions.\n\n### Current Game Analysis\n- **Player Positioning**: The avatar (represented by \u201cA\u201d) is near the lower left of the layout, facing various interactive sprites, such as walls (*), boulders (#), and a series of objective items including goals (% and $).\n- **Goals**: The primary goal appears as the dollar sign ($), and the percentage signs (%) may denote different scoring targets or additional goals.\n- **Obstacles**: The player must navigate through walls, avoid dangers (like @), and interact with the glowing symbols (&) that might indicate important entities in the game. \n\n### High-Level Strategy\n1. **Identify Safe Movement**:\n   - Begin by assessing the immediate vicinity around the avatar. Ensure no immediate threats (the @ symbols) are nearby before any movement action is taken. If needed, take a step back to reposition safely.\n\n2. **Path to the Goal ($)**:\n   - Highlight the shortest route towards the goal ($). The safest path must be evaluated free of obstacles that could jeopardize the avatar (like @ hazards). \n\n3. **Utilize Walls for Protection**:\n   - Identify how the walls (*) can be used as barriers against any moving threats while allowing the avatar to push forward toward the goal. Movement should aim to keep the avatar hidden behind obstacles where possible.\n\n4. **Experiment with Box Interactions**:\n   - Leverage any box sprites (*) nearby for potential shield interaction against hazards (@). If interaction with boxes is possible, explore moving boxes to create barriers or to access areas that weren\u2019t previously reachable.\n\n5. **Clear High-Risk Threats**:\n   - Target threats (@) where possible using a strategic combination of pushing boulders (#) or moving across interactive points to eliminate them. This action might grant additional score points while reducing hazards in the area.\n\n6. **Monitor Resource Limits**:\n   - Keep an eye on the SpriteCounter limit. Confirm that all potential actions can be undertaken without quickly depleting sustainability. The goal is to manage interactions efficiently without leading the avatar to an unfavorable state.\n\n7. **Stay Flexible**:\n   - The game encourages adaptability under trial and error mechanics. If a certain path fails, don\u2019t hesitate to reevaluate strategies or explore alternatives. The level design may hide opportunities that become apparent through different perspectives.\n\n8. **Maximize Score Opportunities**:\n   - Whenever situation permits, seek opportunities to score high points (possibly related to interacting with collectible items %). Focus on completing challenges that seem feasible without risking life for minute score differences.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n- **First Move Choices**:\n   1. Analyze surroundings and confirm immediate threat data.\n   2. Move the avatar towards a wall or box for protection while heading toward an unobstructed path toward ($).\n   3. Identify any naive moves that can result in quick subsequent actions: moving boxes, adjusting threats.\n   \n- **Next Actions**:\n   - Based on outcomes from the first moves and immediate surrounding changes, choose routes that prioritize reaching the goal and minimizing damage or threat responses. Continuous assessment should filter into the next decisions based on drawn outcomes from the avatar's interactions and movements.\n\nIn essence, your approach should balance safe navigation towards completing the goal with maximizing available resources and opportunities for scoring, ensuring a blend of strategic thinking and tactical maneuvering in this engaging puzzle/platformer environment.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
