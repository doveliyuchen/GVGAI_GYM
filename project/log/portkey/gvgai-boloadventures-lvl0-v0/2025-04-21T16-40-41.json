    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game appears to be a puzzle-platformer. The combination of movable sprites (avatar, boxes) and static obstacles (walls, holes) suggests a requirement for strategic planning to solve puzzles, navigate the level, and achieve specific objectives.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:**  \n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can interact with various elements.\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include walls, ground, and goals that set the physical bounds and objectives of the game.\n   - **Passive and Missile Sprites:** The presence of boxes and boulders indicates that they can be used to interact with the environment dynamically. Missiles (like lasers) add an element of danger that the player must navigate.\n\n2. **Interactions:**  \n   - The game features a variety of interactions. The avatar can bounce off boxes, be pushed back by walls, and is affected by various types of missiles (like lasers), which can kill the avatar depending on their orientation.\n   - Laser cannons suggest an additional layer of challenge, where players must avoid or strategically use these hazards.\n   - Colliding with the goal (door) gives a score increase, indicating level completion.\n\n3. **Killing Conditions:**  \n   - The avatar can die by colliding with walls, lasers, or holes under certain conditions, which introduces a tactical element to avoid death while navigating.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective appears to be reaching the goal sprite while avoiding hazards and overcoming obstacles. Players can score points for actions like killing enemies or successfully navigating to the goal. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite (scoring 5 points).\n- **Losing:** The player loses if the avatar (controlled character) is killed, resulting in the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Path Planning:** Before making any moves, survey the layout to determine potential pathways to the goal and possible hazards. Look for safe routes allowing for box interactions to potentially create barriers against lasers.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Use boxes to shield the avatar from lasers or to create blockades. Certain interactions make boxes valuable in controlling movements of boulders and redirecting lasers.\n\n3. **Avoiding Lasers:** Since lasers can kill the avatar based on direction, always move with caution, ensuring you're not in their line of fire. Use walls and boxes to shield yourself while planning your next move.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning:** Timing is crucial, especially when navigating near lasers and moving boulders. Position the avatar to anticipate the movement and timing of the laser cannons.\n\n5. **Exploit Hazard Interactions:** Some interactions (like boulders and holes) may allow for creative solutions by manipulating the environment. Be mindful of these interactions to gain an advantage.\n\nIn summary, strategic navigation through careful planning, environmental manipulation using boxes, and timing will be crucial to successfully reaching the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = *, col = *)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Interact with the '*' symbols to manipulate boxes and create barriers against hazards, ensuring safety first before engaging with the '&' symbol for potential further progress or points.**\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n",

    "content": "In the current game state, the avatar is positioned at (11, 1) and has access to several items around it, including boxes ('*') and the goal ('$'). Per the high-level plan, the immediate focus should be on interacting with the '*' symbols to create barriers before proceeding to the '&' symbols. \n\nThe nearest '*' symbols are at (10, 1) and (10, 2). Interacting with the box at (10, 1) would be beneficial to create a barrier against any hazards while keeping an eye on the ultimate goal.\n\nI'll choose to move downward to interact with the box.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy as it allows for box manipulation, which is crucial for creating barriers and ensuring safety while progressing toward the goals and points.",
