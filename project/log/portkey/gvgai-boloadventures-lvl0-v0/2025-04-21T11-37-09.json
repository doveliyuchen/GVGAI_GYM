The mechanics involve manipulating objects (boxes and boulders) to navigate through a level and reach a goal while avoiding various hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites** - There are different character and environment types (sprites) which have specific roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character.\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: Objects that can interact with the avatar and other environmental elements.\n   - **Lasers**: Act as hazards that can kill the avatar under certain conditions.\n   - **Walls and Holes**: They limit movement or can eliminate the avatar if positioned incorrectly.\n   - **Goal**: The target the player needs to reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions** - The game features various interactions:\n   - **Transformations**: The ability for boulders to become animated (boulderm) and interact with other objects.\n   - **Killing Conditions**: The avatar can die when confronted with lasers or falls into holes.\n   - **Shielding Mechanism**: Boxes can provide temporary protection against lasers.\n   - **Bouncing Mechanism**: When the avatar collides with a box, it may bounce away, using or needing spatial awareness to navigate.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to get the **avatar** to the **goal** sprite while maneuvering around obstacles, avoiding hazards, and manipulating other sprites to create a safe path.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal (score change of 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit of the avatar reaches 0) or if the avatar falls into holes, as this can lead to a loss state as well (both the avatar and hole are removed from the game).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Players should familiarize themselves with the layout to anticipate moving hazards (lasers, boulders) and plan a route to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes for Protection**: Strategically place boxes to block lasers when navigating through risky areas. The avatar can shield itself from frontal laser attacks using boxes.\n\n3. **Plan Boulder Interactions**: Understand the properties of boulders. Players can use them to create paths or as obstacles for other hazards. Keep away from the boulders to avoid becoming a boulderm.\n\n4. **Move Carefully**: Since hitting walls pushes the avatar back, players should steer clear of excessive wall contact. Calculate movements to avoid falling into holes, especially by predicting bounce movements.\n\n5. **Enemy Management**: If lasers are stationary or facing a direction, determine the safest route to avoid triggering their kill conditions while proceeding toward the goal.\n\nBy focusing on interaction mechanics and strategic movement, players can efficiently navigate through the level and achieve the objective successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The immediate surrounding tiles include:\n- (10, 1): A wall ('*')\n- (12, 1): A boulder ('@')\n- (11, 0): A box ('#')\n- (11, 2): An open space ('.')\n\nCurrently, the avatar is surrounded by the wall to the left and below, a boulder to the right, and a box upwards, which are potential items for interaction. The goal is to navigate towards the goal sprite ('$') located at (11, 11) while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Obstacles and Potential Moves\n- The wall at (10, 1) prevents movement to the left.\n- The boulder at (12, 1) is directly below the avatar, and pushing this boulder is not viable as it will block potential paths.\n- The box at (11, 0) can be moved and may help in reaching the goal indirectly by creating a structure to maneuver better in the future.\n\n### Available Actions\nConsidering the immediate items around the avatar:\n- The box ('#') at (11, 0) is the most strategic item to interact with as pushing it will create space for movement upward (if possible) or sideways towards the right, leading us potentially closer to the goal.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n1. Push the box at (11, 0) one step downwards into the space occupied by the avatar.\n2. This will clear the path and open movement towards the goal later.\n\nThis move would create more potential paths for the avatar to navigate, and it allows for further strategic plays with the box that might shield the avatar from hazards or help create pathways.\n\n```**Push the box (#) located at (11, 0) down to (11, 1) to clear the path and open up new movement options towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The current game state reveals that the avatar is enclosed by walls on both the left (x=0) and the right (x=2) sides and a wall above (y=10). The spaces around the avatar include:\n\n- (10, 1): Wall ('b')\n- (12, 1): Wall ('b')\n- (11, 0): Box ('#')\n- (11, 2): Ground ('.')\n\nThe only item the avatar can interact with in this position is the box ('#') at (11, 0).\n\n### Obstacles and Possible Actions\n- The walls surrounding the avatar prevent movement to the left and right (up and down).\n- The box is positioned below the avatar, allowing it to be pushed to create movement opportunities.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe most logical action for the avatar is to push the box at (11, 0) to (12, 0). This will create an opportunity for the avatar to move right on its next turn. The box can also potentially help in later maneuvers or shielding against any hazards that may arise.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n1. Push the box ('#') at (11, 0) downwards to (12, 0). This will clear space for the avatar to move to (11, 2) in the next step while keeping the way towards the goal (11, 11) available.\n\nThis move is strategic because it allows for more options in the following steps, while preparing to navigate further right toward the goal.\n\n```**Push the box (#) located at (11, 0) down to (12, 0) to clear the path for future moves toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding tiles are as follows:\n\n- (9, 1): Wall ('b')\n- (11, 1): Wall ('b')\n- (10, 0): Box ('#')\n- (10, 2): Ground ('.')\n\nVertical movement isn't possible because both left (9, 1) and right (11, 1) tiles are walls. The options left for interaction come down to either pushing the box at (10, 0) down (11, 0) or moving to the free space at (10, 2).\n\n### Obstacles and Possible Actions\n1. **Walls**: Walls at (9, 1) and (11, 1) restrict movement.\n2. **Box**: The box at (10, 0) can be moved downward to (11, 0), potentially allowing space for the avatar to go up afterward.\n3. **Ground**: The tile at (10, 2) is a valid move but does not interact with any item.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe strategic action here would be to **push the box (#) at (10, 0) downward to (11, 0)**. This move creates room for the avatar to potentially navigate up later or to the right towards the goal. Given the configuration, it's a necessary step to create space since the immediate goal is to advance towards the goal at (11, 11).\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n1. **Push the box (#) located at (10, 0) down to (11, 0)** to clear the way for future moves. This will allow the avatar to access the space at (10, 2) on the next turn and eventually progress towards the goal.\n\nThis move positions the avatar better for navigating around walls and toward the goal.\n\n```**Push the box (#) located at (10, 0) down to (11, 0) to clear space for future movement towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The mechanics involve manipulating objects (boxes and boulders) to navigate through a level and reach a goal while avoiding various hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites** - There are different character and environment types (sprites) which have specific roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character.\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: Objects that can interact with the avatar and other environmental elements.\n   - **Lasers**: Act as hazards that can kill the avatar under certain conditions.\n   - **Walls and Holes**: They limit movement or can eliminate the avatar if positioned incorrectly.\n   - **Goal**: The target the player needs to reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions** - The game features various interactions:\n   - **Transformations**: The ability for boulders to become animated (boulderm) and interact with other objects.\n   - **Killing Conditions**: The avatar can die when confronted with lasers or falls into holes.\n   - **Shielding Mechanism**: Boxes can provide temporary protection against lasers.\n   - **Bouncing Mechanism**: When the avatar collides with a box, it may bounce away, using or needing spatial awareness to navigate.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to get the **avatar** to the **goal** sprite while maneuvering around obstacles, avoiding hazards, and manipulating other sprites to create a safe path.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal (score change of 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit of the avatar reaches 0) or if the avatar falls into holes, as this can lead to a loss state as well (both the avatar and hole are removed from the game).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Players should familiarize themselves with the layout to anticipate moving hazards (lasers, boulders) and plan a route to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes for Protection**: Strategically place boxes to block lasers when navigating through risky areas. The avatar can shield itself from frontal laser attacks using boxes.\n\n3. **Plan Boulder Interactions**: Understand the properties of boulders.

By doing this, the avatar can later move into (11, 2) or further utilize the newly created space to move along the path toward the goal (11, 11).\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n1. **Push the box (#) located at (11, 0) down to (12, 0)**. This will create more room for the avatar for potential movements and keep options open towards reaching the goal located at (11, 11).\n\nThis action is necessary as it will aid in navigating the next steps and facilitate future moves.\n\n```**Push the box (#) located at (11, 0) down to (12, 0) to create space for future movement towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The mechanics involve manipulating objects (boxes and boulders) to navigate through a level and reach a goal while avoiding various hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites** - There are different character and environment types (sprites) which have specific roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character.\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: Objects that can interact with the avatar and other environmental elements.\n   - **Lasers**: Act as hazards that can kill the avatar under certain conditions.\n   - **Walls and Holes**: They limit movement or can eliminate the avatar if positioned incorrectly.\n   - **Goal**: The target the player needs to reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions** - The game features various interactions:\n   - **Transformations**: The ability for boulders to become animated (boulderm) and interact with other objects.\n   - **Killing Conditions**: The avatar can die when confronted with lasers or falls into holes.\n   - **Shielding Mechanism**: Boxes can provide temporary protection against lasers.\n   - **Bouncing Mechanism**: When the avatar collides with a box, it may bounce away, using or needing spatial awareness to navigate.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to get the **avatar** to the **goal** sprite while maneuvering around obstacles, avoiding hazards, and manipulating other sprites to create a safe path.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal (score change of 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit of the avatar reaches 0) or if the avatar falls into holes, as this can lead to a loss state as well (both the avatar and hole are removed from the game).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Players should familiarize themselves with the layout to anticipate moving hazards (lasers, boulders) and plan a route to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes for Protection**: Strategically place boxes to block lasers when navigating through risky areas. The avatar can shield itself from frontal laser attacks using boxes.\n\n3. **Plan Boulder Interactions**: Understand the properties of boulders. Players can use them to create paths or as obstacles for other hazards. Keep away from the boulders to avoid becoming a boulderm.\n\n4. **Move Carefully**: Since hitting walls pushes the avatar back, players should steer clear of excessive wall contact. Calculate movements to avoid falling into holes, especially by predicting bounce movements.\n\n5. **Enemy Management**: If lasers are stationary or facing a direction, determine the safest route to avoid triggering their kill conditions while proceeding toward the goal.\n\nBy focusing on interaction mechanics and strategic movement, players can efficiently navigate through the level and achieve the objective successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The mechanics involve manipulating objects (boxes and boulders) to navigate through a level and reach a goal while avoiding various hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites** - There are different character and environment types (sprites) which have specific roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character.\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: Objects that can interact with the avatar and other environmental elements.\n   - **Lasers**: Act as hazards that can kill the avatar under certain conditions.\n   - **Walls and Holes**: They limit movement or can eliminate the avatar if positioned incorrectly.\n   - **Goal**: The target the player needs to reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions** - The game features various interactions:\n   - **Transformations**: The ability for boulders to become animated (boulderm) and interact with other objects.\n   - **Killing Conditions**: The avatar can die when confronted with lasers or falls into holes.\n   - **Shielding Mechanism**: Boxes can provide temporary protection against lasers.\n   - **Bouncing Mechanism**: When the avatar collides with a box, it may bounce away, using or needing spatial awareness to navigate.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to get the **avatar** to the **goal** sprite while maneuvering around obstacles, avoiding hazards, and manipulating other sprites to create a safe path.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal (score change of 5).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit of the avatar reaches 0) or if the avatar falls into holes, as this can lead to a loss state as well (both the avatar and hole are removed from the game).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Players should familiarize themselves with the layout to anticipate moving hazards (lasers, boulders) and plan a route to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes for Protection**: Strategically place boxes to block lasers when navigating through risky areas. The avatar can shield itself from frontal laser attacks using boxes.\n\n3. **Plan Boulder Interactions**: Understand the properties of boulders. Players can use them to create paths or as obstacles for other hazards. Keep away from the boulders to avoid becoming a boulderm.\n\n4. **Move Carefully**: Since hitting walls pushes the avatar back, players should steer clear of excessive wall contact. Calculate movements to avoid falling into holes, especially by predicting bounce movements.\n\n5. **Enemy Management**: If lasers are stationary or facing a direction, determine the safest route to avoid triggering their kill conditions while proceeding toward the goal.\n\nBy focusing on interaction mechanics and strategic movement, players can efficiently navigate through the level and achieve the objective successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=1, x=22)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=22)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Current Analysis\nThe avatar ('a') is positioned at (11, 1). The surrounding tiles are as follows:\n\n- (10, 1): Wall ('b')\n- (12, 1): Wall ('b')\n- (11, 0): Box ('#')\n- (11, 2): Ground ('.')\n\nThe walls on both the left (10, 1) and right (12, 1) block lateral movement, restricting access to any horizontal positions. Thus, the avatar cannot move left or down.\n\n### Obstacles and Possible Actions\n1. **Walls**: The walls prevent horizontal movement, making it crucial to utilize vertical movement or interactions with the box.\n2. **Box Interaction**: The box at (11, 0) can be pushed downward to (12, 0), which will provide more opportunities for movement.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe most effective action is to **push the box ('#') located at (11, 0) down to (12, 0)**. By executing this move, space will be cleared, allowing the avatar to navigate towards (11, 2) in the next turn.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n1. **Push the box (#) down from (11, 0) to (12, 0)**. This action will open a path for future movement, enabling the avatar to access the ground above and ultimately approaching the goal (located at (11, 11)).\n\nThis critical action allows the avatar to continue progressing and aids in the successful navigation through the level.\n\n```**Push the box (#) located at (11, 0) down to (12, 0) to create space for future movement toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
