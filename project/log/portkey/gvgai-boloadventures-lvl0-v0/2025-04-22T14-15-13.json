The player controls an avatar that interacts with various environmental elements to achieve specific objectives while navigating a level.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of different sprites including walls, holes, goals, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the avatar itself. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The player can manipulate the environment by moving the avatar into other sprites, leading to various consequences such as bouncing, killing sprites, or transforming the avatar.\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar is subject to movement restrictions and has to navigate around walls, which can also bounce back when collided with. The avatar can also use boxes as shields against lasers when in the correct position.\n4. **Scoring System**: Players can gain scores through certain interactions, such as entering the goal or killing specific sprites.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective of the game is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite. Achieving this will provide a score boost (score change of +5) and change the win status. The avatar must strategically navigate through the dangers posed by lasers, boulders, and holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having the avatar reach the goal, at which point the game terminates with a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count goes to zero. This can happen if the avatar is killed by various threats (e.g., lasers, falling into holes).\n\n**Overall Strategy**:\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Study the layout of the level before making moves. The level grid shows walls and the layout of holes, so planning optimal paths is crucial.\n2. **Using Boxes Wisely**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from lasers and manipulate the environment to block laser paths. Be aware of the boulders' potential as both obstacles and tools to create safe paths.\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Stay clear of holes and be cautious around lasers. Learning their patterns and timing can open safe paths.\n4. **Movement Considerations**: Since the avatar cannot step through walls, ensure movements are calculated to avoid backtracking into walls and potentially cause further hindrance.\n5. **Managing Boulders and Boulderm**: Knowing when to transform the boulder into the boulderm (which attracts gaze) can create diversions or block paths that would otherwise be dangerous.\n6. **Keep an Eye on Score**: As scoring can be affected by taking specific actions, be mindful of opportunities to score and prioritize actions that will lead to a safer path toward the goal.\n\nBy employing strategic movement, environmental manipulation, and careful consideration of hazards, players can maximize their chances of successfully navigating the level to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n**Game Analysis**\n\n**Genre**: \nBased on the rules and mechanics described, this game appears to belong to the puzzle-platformer genre. The player controls an avatar that interacts with various environmental elements to achieve specific objectives while navigating a level.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of different sprites including walls, holes, goals, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the avatar itself. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The player can manipulate the environment by moving the avatar into other sprites, leading to various consequences such as bouncing, killing sprites, or transforming the avatar.\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar is subject to movement restrictions and has to navigate around walls, which can also bounce back when collided with. The avatar can also use boxes as shields against lasers when in the correct position.\n4. **Scoring System**: Players can gain scores through certain interactions, such as entering the goal or killing specific sprites.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective of the game is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite. Achieving this will provide a score boost (score change of +5) and change the win status. The avatar must strategically navigate through the dangers posed by lasers, boulders, and holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having the avatar reach the goal, at which point the game terminates with a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count goes to zero. This can happen if the avatar is killed by various threats (e.g., lasers, falling into holes).\n\n**Overall Strategy**:\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Study the layout of the level before making moves. The level grid shows walls and the layout of holes, so planning optimal paths is crucial.\n2. **Using Boxes Wisely**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from lasers and manipulate the environment to block laser paths. Be aware of the boulders' potential as both obstacles and tools to create safe paths.\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Stay clear of holes and be cautious around lasers. Learning their patterns and timing can open safe paths.\n4. **Movement Considerations**: Since the avatar cannot step through walls, ensure movements are calculated to avoid backtracking into walls and potentially cause further hindrance.\n5. **Managing Boulders and Boulderm**: Knowing when to transform the boulder into the boulderm (which attracts gaze) can create diversions or block paths that would otherwise be dangerous.\n6. **Keep an Eye on Score**: As scoring can be affected by taking specific actions, be mindful of opportunities to score and prioritize actions that will lead to a safer path toward the goal.\n\nBy employing strategic movement, environmental manipulation, and careful consideration of hazards, players can maximize their chances of successfully navigating the level to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.
