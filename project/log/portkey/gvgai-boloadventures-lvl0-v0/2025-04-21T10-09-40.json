The player navigates a defined space (the grid) while interacting with various objects to solve challenges.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites including the avatar, boxes, boulders, lasers, and obstacles (walls, holes, goal).\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, holes, and lasers.\n   - The goal is to reach a specific point (the goal sprite) while navigating through obstacles and traps.\n   - Specific interactions lead to different effects, such as transforming objects or killing the avatar.\n3. **Lasers**: These can kill the avatar based on frontal encounters or general proximity, adding a layer of strategic movement required for the player.\n4. **Boulders**: Acting as both obstacles and tools for progression, they can be used against walls, lasers, or boulders, further influencing movement and strategies.\n5. **Score System**: The score changes based on the interactions (e.g., reaching the goal or killing sprites).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding deadly interactions (like lasers) and navigating the level's layout effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite count reaches 0, meaning the avatar is eliminated through interactions (e.g., being hit by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the layout thoroughly to understand the positions of obstacles and the goal.\n   - Identify safe pathways and potential hazards (like concentrated lasers or tightly packed walls).\n2. **Manage Interactions**: Use boxes effectively as shields against lasers, and leverage boulders to create pathways or block hazards.\n   - Anticipate how boulders and boxes interact and be prepared to use them strategically.\n3. **Timing and Movement**: Learn to time movements wisely around laser cannons; knowing when to advance and when to step back is crucial.\n   - Practice anticipation of the lasers' firing to find safe pathways.\n4. **Incremental Advancements**: Make small, cautious movements toward the goal and reassess after each action.\n   - Avoid unnecessary risks as losing the avatar resets progress.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires strategic planning, precise movement, and problem-solving skills. By understanding the mechanics, utilizing the available sprites wisely, and planning routes while avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate the environment and reach their goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The player navigates a defined space (the grid) while interacting with various objects to solve challenges.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites including the avatar, boxes, boulders, lasers, and obstacles (walls, holes, goal).\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, holes, and lasers.\n   - The goal is to reach a specific point (the goal sprite) while navigating through obstacles and traps.\n   - Specific interactions lead to different effects, such as transforming objects or killing the avatar.\n3. **Lasers**: These can kill the avatar based on frontal encounters or general proximity, adding a layer of strategic movement required for the player.\n4. **Boulders**: Acting as both obstacles and tools for progression, they can be used against walls, lasers, or boulders, further influencing movement and strategies.\n5. **Score System**: The score changes based on the interactions (e.g., reaching the goal or killing sprites).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding deadly interactions (like lasers) and navigating the level's layout effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite count reaches 0, meaning the avatar is eliminated through interactions (e.g., being hit by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the layout thoroughly to understand the positions of obstacles and the goal.\n   - Identify safe pathways and potential hazards (like concentrated lasers or tightly packed walls).\n2. **Manage Interactions**: Use boxes effectively as shields against lasers, and leverage boulders to create pathways or block hazards.\n   - Anticipate how boulders and boxes interact and be prepared to use them strategically.\n3. **Timing and Movement**: Learn to time movements wisely around laser cannons; knowing when to advance and when to step back is crucial.\n   - Practice anticipation of the lasers' firing to find safe pathways.\n4. **Incremental Advancements**: Make small, cautious movements toward the goal and reassess after each action.\n   - Avoid unnecessary risks as losing the avatar resets progress.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires strategic planning, precise movement, and problem-solving skills.

The player navigates a defined space (the grid) while interacting with various objects to solve challenges.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites including the avatar, boxes, boulders, lasers, and obstacles (walls, holes, goal).\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, holes, and lasers.\n   - The goal is to reach a specific point (the goal sprite) while navigating through obstacles and traps.\n   - Specific interactions lead to different effects, such as transforming objects or killing the avatar.\n3. **Lasers**: These can kill the avatar based on frontal encounters or general proximity, adding a layer of strategic movement required for the player.\n4. **Boulders**: Acting as both obstacles and tools for progression, they can be used against walls, lasers, or boulders, further influencing movement and strategies.\n5. **Score System**: The score changes based on the interactions (e.g., reaching the goal or killing sprites).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding deadly interactions (like lasers) and navigating the level's layout effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite count reaches 0, meaning the avatar is eliminated through interactions (e.g., being hit by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the layout thoroughly to understand the positions of obstacles and the goal.\n   - Identify safe pathways and potential hazards (like concentrated lasers or tightly packed walls).\n2. **Manage Interactions**: Use boxes effectively as shields against lasers, and leverage boulders to create pathways or block hazards.\n   - Anticipate how boulders and boxes interact and be prepared to use them strategically.\n3. **Timing and Movement**: Learn to time movements wisely around laser cannons; knowing when to advance and when to step back is crucial.\n   - Practice anticipation of the lasers' firing to find safe pathways.\n4. **Incremental Advancements**: Make small, cautious movements toward the goal and reassess after each action.\n   - Avoid unnecessary risks as losing the avatar resets progress.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires strategic planning, precise movement, and problem-solving skills. By understanding the mechanics, utilizing the available sprites wisely, and planning routes while avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate the environment and reach their goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The player navigates a defined space (the grid) while interacting with various objects to solve challenges.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites including the avatar, boxes, boulders, lasers, and obstacles (walls, holes, goal).\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, holes, and lasers.\n   - The goal is to reach a specific point (the goal sprite) while navigating through obstacles and traps.\n   - Specific interactions lead to different effects, such as transforming objects or killing the avatar.\n3. **Lasers**: These can kill the avatar based on frontal encounters or general proximity, adding a layer of strategic movement required for the player.\n4. **Boulders**: Acting as both obstacles and tools for progression, they can be used against walls, lasers, or boulders, further influencing movement and strategies.\n5. **Score System**: The score changes based on the interactions (e.g., reaching the goal or killing sprites).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding deadly interactions (like lasers) and navigating the level's layout effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite count reaches 0, meaning the avatar is eliminated through interactions (e.g., being hit by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the layout thoroughly to understand the positions of obstacles and the goal.\n   - Identify safe pathways and potential hazards (like concentrated lasers or tightly packed walls).\n2. **Manage Interactions**: Use boxes effectively as shields against lasers, and leverage boulders to create pathways or block hazards.\n   - Anticipate how boulders and boxes interact and be prepared to use them strategically.\n3. **Timing and Movement**: Learn to time movements wisely around laser cannons; knowing when to advance and when to step back is crucial.\n   - Practice anticipation of the lasers' firing to find safe pathways.\n4. **Incremental Advancements**: Make small, cautious movements toward the goal and reassess after each action.\n   - Avoid unnecessary risks as losing the avatar resets progress.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires strategic planning, precise movement, and problem-solving skills. By understanding the mechanics, utilizing the available sprites wisely, and planning routes while avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate the environment and reach their goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the game's rules and layout provided, let\u2019s break down the game into its key aspects:\n\n### Genre\nGiven the mechanics and nature described, this game appears to belong to the \"Puzzle\" genre, with elements of platforming. The player navigates a defined space (the grid) while interacting with various objects to solve challenges.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites including the avatar, boxes, boulders, lasers, and obstacles (walls, holes, goal).\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, holes, and lasers.\n   - The goal is to reach a specific point (the goal sprite) while navigating through obstacles and traps.\n   - Specific interactions lead to different effects, such as transforming objects or killing the avatar.\n3. **Lasers**: These can kill the avatar based on frontal encounters or general proximity, adding a layer of strategic movement required for the player.\n4. **Boulders**: Acting as both obstacles and tools for progression, they can be used against walls, lasers, or boulders, further influencing movement and strategies.\n5. **Score System**: The score changes based on the interactions (e.g., reaching the goal or killing sprites).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding deadly interactions (like lasers) and navigating the level's layout effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite count reaches 0, meaning the avatar is eliminated through interactions (e.g., being hit by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Study the layout thoroughly to understand the positions of obstacles and the goal.\n   - Identify safe pathways and potential hazards (like concentrated lasers or tightly packed walls).\n2. **Manage Interactions**: Use boxes effectively as shields against lasers, and leverage boulders to create pathways or block hazards.\n   - Anticipate how boulders and boxes interact and be prepared to use them strategically.\n3. **Timing and Movement**: Learn to time movements wisely around laser cannons; knowing when to advance and when to step back is crucial.\n   - Practice anticipation of the lasers' firing to find safe pathways.\n4. **Incremental Advancements**: Make small, cautious movements toward the goal and reassess after each action.\n   - Avoid unnecessary risks as losing the avatar resets progress.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires strategic planning, precise movement, and problem-solving skills. By understanding the mechanics, utilizing the available sprites wisely, and planning routes while avoiding hazards, players can successfully navigate the environment and reach their goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Next Step Strategy**: Move the avatar down towards the boulder to use it as a protective barrier while advancing toward the goal, but be prepared to quickly alter your action if the laser threat escalates or remains unchanged.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This action also positions the avatar to quickly respond to any new threats or changes in the environment that may arise after the move.",
