For instance, the avatar can shield against lasers using boxes, and there are multiple ways to push or transform boulders.\n- **Hazard Management**: The game includes lethal interactions with obstacles (like lasers) that can result in the avatar\u2019s demise based on positioning, indicating careful movement is essential.\n- **Goal and Scoring**: Players need to reach a goal while maximizing score through specified interactions, such as performing actions that change sprite states favorably. Otherwise, encountering hazards results in penalty.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the goal (the door) represented by the sprite `goal avatar`, which gives a score change of 5 points.\n- Players can also score through interactions that involve killing other sprites or successfully navigating obstacles.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- A win occurs if the avatar successfully reaches the goal before running out of avatars (SpriteCounter limit = 0).\n- The game ends in a loss if the avatar count reaches zero or if the player fails to reach the goal.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore Wisely**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the layout. Identify areas that are safe and those that contain hazards (like walls or lasers).\n2. **Object Manipulation**: Utilize boxes strategically for protection against lasers. Position them to hide behind when necessary to avoid frontal attacks.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Keep a safe distance from obstacles that can kill your avatar (lasers and walls). Pay attention to how to navigate the layout without triggering lethal interactions.\n4. **Prioritize Movement**: Focus on reaching the goal while planning routes that can dodge hazards. Take caution when interacting with boulders; they can either help you (by blocking paths) or hinder you (if they connect with your avatar).\n5. **Score Maximization**: Look for additional opportunities to gain points via interactions outside of reaching the goal. Consider the bonus from transforming and eliminating sprites.\n6. **Plan for Backtracking**: If you are in a situation where you get blocked, consider how you might undo moves or reposition sprites effectively without losing your avatar.\n7. **Practice Positioning**: Since players can 'step back' when encountering walls, practice your movement to conserve avatar numbers while ensuring you are in a position to advance strategically.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can enhance their chances of success in navigating the complexities of the game, reaching the goal, and maximizing their score effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

There are no immediate interactable items (like boxes or boulders) adjacent to the avatar. However, in the vicinity, there is a box at (y=2, x=20) that can possibly be pushed.\n\n### Strategy\nTo make progress in this state, the best course of action is to move toward the nearby box located at (y=2, x=20). This box will allow the avatar to potentially block hazards or be used to navigate different sections of the level. Moving toward the box can help facilitate further actions like pushing the box towards the desired goal or clearing a path.\n\n#### Looking forward, if moving towards the box does not yield further interactions or changes in state (e.g. due to walls), the strategy would need to adapt, focusing on the next closest interactable object (which would be other available boxes or boulders).\n\nConsidering all the elements discussed, the action plan is as follows:\n\n```**Approach the box**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surroundings are as follows:\n- **Left (y=2, x=21)**: The avatar is adjacent to an empty space that provides an open path.\n- **Left again (y=2, x=20)**: There is a box (`#`), which can be pushed.\n- **Below (y=3, x=22)**: There is a wall (`b`).\n- **Above (y=1, x=22)**: There is also a wall (`b`).\n\nSince the box is located at (y=2, x=20) and the avatar is positioned such that it can push the box left into an open area, this action would help clear the path and allow for further movement or interaction in subsequent moves.\n\n### Strategy\nTo facilitate movement and potentially set up further progress towards the goal, the optimal action is to push the box located at (y=2, x=20). This will create more space in the environment and allow for more strategic positioning of the objects in future turns.\n\nFurthermore, since the game state indicates that outputs have changed indicating potentially additional walls or items, it would be prudent to push the box first and reassess the area for any new opportunities afterward.\n\nGiven the conditions, the recommended action is:\n\n```**Push the box left**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

For instance, the avatar can shield against lasers using boxes, and there are multiple ways to push or transform boulders.\n- **Hazard Management**: The game includes lethal interactions with obstacles (like lasers) that can result in the avatar\u2019s demise based on positioning, indicating careful movement is essential.\n- **Goal and Scoring**: Players need to reach a goal while maximizing score through specified interactions, such as performing actions that change sprite states favorably. Otherwise, encountering hazards results in penalty.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the goal (the door) represented by the sprite `goal avatar`, which gives a score change of 5 points.\n- Players can also score through interactions that involve killing other sprites or successfully navigating obstacles.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- A win occurs if the avatar successfully reaches the goal before running out of avatars (SpriteCounter limit = 0).\n- The game ends in a loss if the avatar count reaches zero or if the player fails to reach the goal.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore Wisely**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the layout. Identify areas that are safe and those that contain hazards (like walls or lasers).\n2. **Object Manipulation**: Utilize boxes strategically for protection against lasers. Position them to hide behind when necessary to avoid frontal attacks.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Keep a safe distance from obstacles that can kill your avatar (lasers and walls). Pay attention to how to navigate the layout without triggering lethal interactions.\n4. **Prioritize Movement**: Focus on reaching the goal while planning routes that can dodge hazards. Take caution when interacting with boulders; they can either help you (by blocking paths) or hinder you (if they connect with your avatar).\n5. **Score Maximization**: Look for additional opportunities to gain points via interactions outside of reaching the goal. Consider the bonus from transforming and eliminating sprites.\n6. **Plan for Backtracking**: If you are in a situation where you get blocked, consider how you might undo moves or reposition sprites effectively without losing your avatar.\n7. **Practice Positioning**: Since players can 'step back' when encountering walls, practice your movement to conserve avatar numbers while ensuring you are in a position to advance strategically.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can enhance their chances of success in navigating the complexities of the game, reaching the goal, and maximizing their score effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

The ability to clear this box can lay the groundwork for future movement towards the goal at (y=1, x=1).\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the current layout and the opportunity available, the best action is to push the box at (y=2, x=20). Pushing this box will not only create an open space but will also set up future routes toward the goal while avoiding being blocked by walls.\n\nAfter pushing the box, the subsequent steps can be evaluated based on the new arrangement of objects and possible advanced moves.\n\nBased on this strategic assessment, the high-level action recommendation is:\n\n```**Push the box left**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Otherwise, encountering hazards results in penalty.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the goal (the door) represented by the sprite `goal avatar`, which gives a score change of 5 points.\n- Players can also score through interactions that involve killing other sprites or successfully navigating obstacles.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- A win occurs if the avatar successfully reaches the goal before running out of avatars (SpriteCounter limit = 0).\n- The game ends in a loss if the avatar count reaches zero or if the player fails to reach the goal.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore Wisely**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the layout. Identify areas that are safe and those that contain hazards (like walls or lasers).\n2. **Object Manipulation**: Utilize boxes strategically for protection against lasers. Position them to hide behind when necessary to avoid frontal attacks.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Keep a safe distance from obstacles that can kill your avatar (lasers and walls). Pay attention to how to navigate the layout without triggering lethal interactions.\n4. **Prioritize Movement**: Focus on reaching the goal while planning routes that can dodge hazards. Take caution when interacting with boulders; they can either help you (by blocking paths) or hinder you (if they connect with your avatar).\n5. **Score Maximization**: Look for additional opportunities to gain points via interactions outside of reaching the goal. Consider the bonus from transforming and eliminating sprites.\n6. **Plan for Backtracking**: If you are in a situation where you get blocked, consider how you might undo moves or reposition sprites effectively without losing your avatar.\n7. **Practice Positioning**: Since players can 'step back' when encountering walls, practice your movement to conserve avatar numbers while ensuring you are in a position to advance strategically.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can enhance their chances of success in navigating the complexities of the game, reaching the goal, and maximizing their score effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*..*\n*%%..........*......*.a*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*..*\n*%%..........*......*.a*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=10, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=10, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Current Location Analysis\nThe avatar **'a'** is located at (y=2, x=22). Let\u2019s summarize the surroundings:\n- **Left (y=2, x=21)**: An empty space (`.`).\n- **Left again (y=2, x=20)**: A box (`#`), which is interactable.\n- **Above (y=1, x=22)**: A wall (`b`), blocking upward movement.\n- **Below (y=3, x=22)**: A wall (`b`), blocking downward movement.\n\n### Potential Actions\nSince the box at (y=2, x=20) is directly interactable, the avatar can push this box left into (y=2, x=19). This is the only viable action in this state, as it will not only create an additional open space for movement but also set up potential further interactions with the box or other items in the game.\n\n### Strategy\nPushing the box left will effectively create an opportunity for continued navigation toward the goal, which is at (y=1, x=1). This action is the best choice to increase options for the next moves and get closer to the goal without encountering walls or hazards.\n\nThe high-level action plan for the next step is:\n\n```**Push the box left**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",

Here\u2019s an analysis of the immediate surroundings:\n- **Left (y=2, x=21)**: An empty space (`.`), which allows for movement.\n- **Left again (y=2, x=20)**: A box (`#`), which is an interactable object that can be pushed.\n- **Above (y=1, x=22)**: A wall (`b`), blocking upward movement.\n- **Below (y=3, x=22)**: A wall (`b`), blocking downward movement.\n\nThe box at (y=2, x=20) is the only interactable object that the avatar can work with right now. Pushing this box will create space for further movement and open opportunities for future actions.\n\n### Strategy\nThe most effective action in this situation is to push the box located at (y=2, x=20) to the left into (y=2, x=19). This action will help free up space and allow for better navigation toward the goal in subsequent turns. \n\nBy pushing the box, the avatar will not only keep pressing toward objectives on the game board but also be able to explore further interactions or clearer pathways toward the goal, which is expected to reside in the top-left area of the grid.\n\nThus, the action plan for the next step is:\n\n```**Push the box left**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
