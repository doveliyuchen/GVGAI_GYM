    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here is an analysis of the game, including its genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. It combines elements of problem-solving (puzzles involving sprites and interactions) with navigational challenges that require the player to maneuver through a level.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - The game features various sprites, including walls, goals, avatar, boxes, boulders, and lasers.\n   - The avatar interacts with these sprites in various ways, such as being transformed, killed, or bounced back.\n   - Certain actions (like pushing boxes or avoiding lasers) will impact the avatar\u2019s movement and survivability.\n\n2. **Movement and Combat**:\n   - The avatar can move through the grid-like environment, but certain interactions will restrict movement (e.g., hitting a wall).\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers based on the interaction context (if they approach them from the front or not).\n\n3. **Score System**:\n   - The game also has a scoring system. Successfully navigating to the goal increases the score, while certain actions involving the boulders and the holes yield points.\n\n### Objective\n- The primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** (represented as 'g' in the level layout) while avoiding hazards, such as lasers and the risk of being crushed or transformed by boulders.\n- Players should aim to collect points by manipulating boulders into holes and avoiding danger.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal. This condition is represented by the SpriteCounter for the goal reaching a limit of 0, which indicates the goal has been successfully reached.\n- The player loses if the avatar is transformed to a state that removes it from play (limit of 0 for avatar).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movement**:\n   - Before making a move, plan ahead to avoid walls and lasers. Consider safe routes from the starting position ('A') to the goal ('g').\n   \n2. **Manipulate Sprites**:\n   - Use boxes effectively to shield from lasers or manipulate boulders into positions that can lead to advantageous placements (e.g., into holes).\n   - Utilize the boulder interaction creatively by pushing or attracting them to clear paths or block lasers.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Maintain awareness of laser positions. Navigate using obstacles to block potential harm and always consider frontal approaches carefully.\n   - If facing a boulder or laser head-on, have a strategy ready to retreat to avoid being transformed or killed.\n\n4. **Score Maximization**:\n   - Whenever possible, score points by causing boulders to interact with holes before heading to the goal. This can enhance the score and may provide helpful advantages or new paths.\n\n5. **Use Shielding Objects**:\n   - Make use of boxes as shields when confronting lasers and ensure safe navigation by positioning them wisely to create safe zones within the level layout.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the interactions thoroughly, players can navigate through complex scenarios while increasing their score and successfully reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map, the key information I see is my avatar's position, which is located at (10, 2). \n\n### Current Position\n- The avatar ('a') is situated in a space surrounded by walls. The nearest objects of interest are:\n  - A hole ('%') at (10, 21) and (10, 22)\n  - A goal ('$') at (11, 22)\n  \n### Potential Moves\n- From my current position, I can move:\n  - Left (to (10, 1)): Open space.\n  - Right (to (10, 3)): Wall.\n  - Down (to (11, 2)): Accessible path with a boulder ('@').\n  - Up (to (9, 2)): Open space.\n\n### Considering Actions\n1. **If I move left** (to (10, 1)), I will be in an open space, but it provides no immediate advantage toward moving toward the goal.\n2. **If I move right** (to (10, 3)), it's blocked by a wall, so that's not an option.\n3. **If I move down** (to (11, 2)), I will move to a space occupied by a boulder ('@'). While I can occupy this space, it doesn't help me get closer to my goal right away.\n4. **If I move up** (to (9, 2)), it's also an open space, but again won't lead me closer to the goal immediately.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince the goal is located at (11, 22) and I need to move through the grid toward the rightmost and downward sections, I should focus on moving towards spaces that will help clear the path.\n\nThe most logical action, avoiding walls and advancing in the direction of the goal, is to **move up to (9, 2)**, which keeps my position flexible for future moves while assessing further options.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should allow me to navigate a bit more freely, and I hope to find a better route towards my ultimate goal while maintaining options for future moves.",
