An essential item to consider is the ampersand ('&'), representing an interactive object that may provide benefits such as blocking hazards or creating a protected path. Another important aspect is the presence of hazards, primarily the lasers and boxes.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The avatar is adjacent to walls, hazards (indicated by the presence of '*' symbols), and additional items (particularly an ampersand '*&*' located at positions (10, 6) and (9, 6))\n2. The avatar cannot directly move through walls or hazards, hence making strategic interactions with accessible items necessary for progress.\n3. The ampersand ('&') has the potential to assist in the navigation across the board by clearing or blocking paths, depending on its properties.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nGiven the location of the ampersands in relation to the avatar, a beneficial strategy now is to interact with one of the ampersands ('&') to either use it as a shield against incoming hazards or manipulate it to create a safer route. The surrounding hazards, especially the lasers, need consideration during this interaction to avoid detriment to the avatar's position.\n\nTo summarize this high-level strategy:\n- Approach one of the ampersands to interact with it, utilizing it effectively to create a shield or allowing for a movement path that minimizes risk against the hazards.\n\n```**Interact with the ampersand ('&') to utilize it as a shield against any nearby laser hazards, creating a safer passage for future moves.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The strategic objective involves managing interactions with items while avoiding the threats present in the environment.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The walls (represented as 'b') prohibit movement in multiple directions, concentrating focus on the interaction possibilities with items.\n2. The available items nearby include the ampersands ('&') on the positions (9, 6) and (9, 5). These have the potential to be used for strategic advantage either by clearing a path or creating a block against hazards.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nGiven the current constraints of walls surrounding the avatar, the most beneficial strategy is to interact with one of the ampersands ('&'). By doing so, the avatar can utilize the ampersand either to shield itself from any hazards that may arise or potentially manipulate the surrounding area to create a path that leads to the goal.\n\nTo summarize this high-level strategy:\n- Interact with one of the ampersands ('&') to create either a protective barrier or a functional component of the path that aids in circumventing hazards, thereby allowing a safer navigation strategy for the next moves.\n\n```**Interact with one of the ampersands ('&') to utilize it for blocking hazards or to create a clear path forward, reducing risks of encountering dangers in the next moves.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Its immediate environment comprises walls (represented by 'b'), a clear goal (%), and multiple hazards (lasers and possibly other obstacles). The surrounding structures limit the avatar's movement options, making strategic interactions critical for progressing toward the goal.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The walls surrounding the avatar prevent movement in many directions, effectively isolating the avatar. The only immediate item available for interaction is the ampersands ('&') located at (9, 5) and (9, 6).\n2. Interacting with these ampersands is critical because they may be used to create barriers against hazards or provide a pathway through the challenging layout.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nGiven the constraints of the environment and the available interacting options, the most effective strategy is to interact with one of the ampersands ('&'). This will either serve to block potential hazards from the lasers or provide a temporary standing point for the avatar, allowing for safer navigation in the next moves.\n\nTo summarize this high-level strategy:\n- Engage one of the ampersands ('&') to manipulate it effectively, either to act as a protective barrier against hazards or to pave the way for further movement towards the goal.\n\n```**Interact with one of the ampersands ('&') to use it to shield against hazards or create a pathway that circumvents obstacles, contributing to safer navigation towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This location is strategically important as it severely limits possible movement options. Moreover, the avatar is facing a situation where hazards exist in the environment, namely lasers or obstacles, alongside opportunities to interact with certain items.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The surrounding walls block movement, meaning the avatar cannot directly traverse to nearby areas without careful planning.\n2. There is an ampersand ('&') located at (9, 5) and (9, 6) nearby which can be interacted with to either create a temporary barrier or facilitate movement towards the goal.\n3. The goal represented by the '%' is also in the same column but at a higher row, indicating that a safe route must be created or found to reach it.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nIn the current situation, interacting with the ampersand ('&') is essential. By doing so, the avatar can use it as a means of either obstructing lasers from posing a risk or to manipulate surrounding mechanisms to open up potential pathways toward the goal.\n\nTo summarize this high-level strategy:\n- Engage with the ampersand ('&') to create a protective structure against hazards or facilitate ongoing movement towards the goal, thus improving safety and advancing the overall strategy.\n\n```**Interact with the ampersand ('&') to either create a protective barrier against hazards or use it to facilitate a pathway towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This position places it at the bottom row of the game area, with walls surrounding it to the left and below, making movement options limited. The avatar needs to find a way to navigate towards the goal ('%') while avoiding hazards presented by the environment.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The presence of walls ('b') on the left and below prevents lateral or downward movement, constraining options to either interact with an object or wait for the next opportunity.\n2. Possible items to interact with are the ampersands ('&'), which can be found at positions (9, 5) and (9, 6). However, given the current position of 'a', these ampersands are not directly reachable without moving.\n3. The objective is to navigate toward the goal at (1, 19), while considering the hazards represented by the surrounding walls and any other obstacles in the pathway.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nIn this scenario, the optimal strategy involves focusing on the utilization of the ampersands ('&') located at (9, 5) and (9, 6). Interacting with these will help to manipulate the game state\u2014potentially using them to create a barrier against hazards or facilitate a later pathway towards the goal.\n\nTo summarize this high-level strategy:\n- Interact with one of the ampersands ('&') to create a safer path or block hazards, indirectly assisting in navigation toward the end goal.\n\n```**Interact with the ampersand ('&') to create a protective barrier against hazards or to pave the way for future movement toward the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

In this position, the surrounding walls ('b') on the left and bottom sides restrict movement options severely, as does the presence of obstacles in the path to the goal. The most consequential strategy will depend on interacting with nearby items while considering hazards.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The avatar has limited mobility due to the walls and the structure of the environment. The only potential interaction available is with the items nearby, particularly the ampersands ('&').\n2. There are ampersands ('&') located at (9, 5) and (9, 6) which can be leveraged strategically to either block hazards or create safe pathways toward the goal (which is located at (1, 19)).\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nGiven the current restrictions due to walls and the avatar's location, the best strategy involves interacting with the ampersands ('&'). By doing this, the avatar can either use them to obstruct hazards or to set up for a safer trajectory toward the goal.\n\nTo encapsulate this strategy:\n- Interact with one of the ampersands ('&') to either create a barrier against any potential hazards or to help facilitate a more advantageous route in subsequent moves toward the goal.\n\n```**Interact with the ampersand ('&') to create a barrier against hazards or facilitate a pathway towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The nearby ampersands ('&') and other potential interactive elements will be critical in formulating the next decision.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The walls block the avatar from moving to the left and below, restricting vertical and lateral motion, which necessitates proactive engagement with nearby items.\n2. The only relevant objects nearby are the ampersands ('&') located at (9, 5) and (9, 6) which the avatar can interact with. However, these are not immediately accessible due to the surrounding walls. \n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nSince the avatar cannot reach any immediate items and given the surrounding constraints, the strategy should focus on preparing for the next turn. Interacting with the ampersand is a potential future move, but immediate action should consider the overall layout and hazards.\n\n1. **Preparation for Future Moves**: Since directly interacting with the ampersands ('&') isn't currently feasible due to the restrictions imposed by the walls and lack of accessibility, the strategy will focus on steps that allow access to those ampersands in subsequent turns.\n   \n2. **Plan for Interaction**: In preparation to interact with the ampersands in future turns as options become available, the avatar should aim for strategic positioning to navigate towards them safely.\n\nThus, the strategy will be to assess the next potential steps to create a pathway to reach the ampersands ('&') in the upcoming moves.\n\n```**Plan to create a pathway for future movement towards the ampersands ('&'), which will assist in blocking hazards or facilitating movement toward the goal in subsequent turns.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

In this position, the avatar is one step above the last row of the game area (where both walls and hazards are present). The constraints of the surrounding walls ('b') are important to note, as they restrict movement. However, there are interactive elements nearby, specifically the ampersands ('&'), which play a key role in potential next steps.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The walls to the left and below the avatar block movement, meaning the options are limited to potential interactions with items.\n2. The ampersands ('&') are located at (9, 5) and (9, 6). While the avatar cannot reach these immediately, they present important interaction opportunities for future steps.\n3. The goal ('%') is positioned on the far right side of the grid, thus the overall strategy involves creating a viable path toward reaching this goal while avoiding lasers and other hazards.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nGiven the current constraints and the presence of hazards, the most effective strategy involves preparing for future interaction with the ampersands ('&'). The objective will be to navigate toward a position from which the avatar can effectively interact with the ampersands in subsequent turns.\n\n1. **Preparation for Future Interaction**: The avatar should look to position itself closer to the ampersands, optimizing the path in future moves that may allow direct engagement with them when accessible.\n   \n2. **Utilization of Ampersands**: Once positioned to interact with the ampersands, the avatar can use them to either block potential hazards or create pathways towards the goal.\n\nIn summary, the next strategic step focuses on optimizing movement toward the ampersands while prioritizing future actionable opportunities.\n\n```**Position the avatar to prepare for interaction with the ampersands ('&') in future turns, enhancing the ability to block hazards or create pathways towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This location is critical as it limits immediate movement due to the presence of walls ('b') on the left and hazards above, constraining options for advancing toward the goal ('%') at (1, 19).\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The walls block the avatar from directly moving left or downward, making it impossible to navigate laterally at current coordinates.\n2. The only nearby interactive element is the ampersand ('&'), which is presented as a potentially strategic block or aid in navigating around hazards.\n3. Given the location of ampersands ('&') at (9, 5) and (9, 6), interaction with these will be essential for creating pathways or shields against lasers when more movement options are available.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nSince the avatar cannot move closer to the interactive ampersands ('&') at this time due to the position constraints, the focus should be on preparing future moves that will lead toward effective utilization of the ampersands.\n\n1. **Preparation for Interaction**: The avatar should consider positioning itself in a way that maximizes opportunities for the next few scheduled moves\u2014this could mean planning a pathway toward the ampersands when movement allows.\n\n2. **Utilization of Future Actions**: Engaging with the ampersands when reachable would help either block incoming hazards or offer a more accessible route toward the goal.\n\nIn summary, the strategy centers around preparing to interact with ampersands in upcoming turns, while leveraging any potential pathways or positions that can be accessed.\n\n```**Plan to position the avatar for future interaction with the ampersands ('&'), allowing for barriers against hazards or creating pathways toward the goal in subsequent turns.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

It combines elements of logic and strategic movement, similar to titles like *Sokoban* or *Spelunky*, where players must solve puzzles and navigate through a hazardous environment to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Their Roles:**\n   - **Ground, Walls, Holes, and Goals**: These are immovable structures that define the playable area and objectives.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which interacts with various objects and needs to maneuver to achieve the objective.\n   - **Box and Boulder**: Used to manipulate the environment, potentially to block hazards or create paths.\n   - **Lasercannon and Laser**: Act as hazards that the avatar must avoid, representing danger zones that can result in failure.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with various objects in unique ways, either to block attacks (e.g., using boxes as shields against lasers) or to manipulate threats (e.g., boulders can attract or kill).\n   - The goal sprite signifies the completion of a level, while holes can result in player death if encountered.\n   - The dynamic between the avatar and different types of missiles (boulders transformed to missiles or laser hits) creates a layer of strategy regarding positioning and timing.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from its starting position to the goal while avoiding hazards and manipulating obstacles in the environment. Reaching the goal results in a score increase, and the game's termination conditions reveal that if the avatar is lost (SpriteCounter limit reached), the player loses the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully navigating the avatar to the goal sprite, resulting in a score of 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar encounters a hazard (e.g., a laser or falls into a hole), it counts down, and if it reaches 0, the game is lost.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestion:**\n1. **Observation**: Before making moves, carefully analyze the layout and the positions of all sprites, particularly the lasers, which pose a significant risk to the avatar.\n   \n2. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boxes to shield against lasers. The boulders can also be used strategically by placing them in positions where they can either block a laser or provide safe paths.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path**: Create a mental or physical plan of your moves, considering how each step will interact with the existing hazards and walls. Remember that stepping back or undoing actions is part of the interaction mechanics.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning**: Move the avatar with precision, avoiding lines of sight of the lasers.

It combines elements of logic and strategic movement, similar to titles like *Sokoban* or *Spelunky*, where players must solve puzzles and navigate through a hazardous environment to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Their Roles:**\n   - **Ground, Walls, Holes, and Goals**: These are immovable structures that define the playable area and objectives.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which interacts with various objects and needs to maneuver to achieve the objective.\n   - **Box and Boulder**: Used to manipulate the environment, potentially to block hazards or create paths.\n   - **Lasercannon and Laser**: Act as hazards that the avatar must avoid, representing danger zones that can result in failure.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with various objects in unique ways, either to block attacks (e.g., using boxes as shields against lasers) or to manipulate threats (e.g., boulders can attract or kill).\n   - The goal sprite signifies the completion of a level, while holes can result in player death if encountered.\n   - The dynamic between the avatar and different types of missiles (boulders transformed to missiles or laser hits) creates a layer of strategy regarding positioning and timing.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar from its starting position to the goal while avoiding hazards and manipulating obstacles in the environment. Reaching the goal results in a score increase, and the game's termination conditions reveal that if the avatar is lost (SpriteCounter limit reached), the player loses the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully navigating the avatar to the goal sprite, resulting in a score of 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar encounters a hazard (e.g., a laser or falls into a hole), it counts down, and if it reaches 0, the game is lost.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestion:**\n1. **Observation**: Before making moves, carefully analyze the layout and the positions of all sprites, particularly the lasers, which pose a significant risk to the avatar.\n   \n2. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boxes to shield against lasers. The boulders can also be used strategically by placing them in positions where they can either block a laser or provide safe paths.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path**: Create a mental or physical plan of your moves, considering how each step will interact with the existing hazards and walls. Remember that stepping back or undoing actions is part of the interaction mechanics.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning**: Move the avatar with precision, avoiding lines of sight of the lasers. Position it effectively to bounce or shield when necessary. \n\n5. **Experiment and Learn**: If you fail, observe what led to that outcome. Adjust your strategies based on your observations during each playthrough. Understanding how various sprites interact will assist in future attempts.\n\nBy focusing on positioning and leveraging the environment, you can navigate towards the goal while minimizing risks from the hazards present, leading to successful level completion.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\nboulderm -> 'g'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*@.*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*a@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*@.*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbbb..*\n*a@*...@.......*&bbbb..*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 8, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 8, col = 1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Game Analysis**\n\nThe avatar 'a' is currently positioned at (8, 1). This position gives the avatar immediate access to the ampersand ('&') located at (8, 2), which is crucial for enhancing defensive capabilities while navigating toward the goal ('%') at (12, 19). The surrounding environment includes walls ('b') that limit movement but can also provide strategic protection.\n\n**Assessment of Current Situation:**\n1. The ampersand ('&') at (8, 2) is accessible and can be utilized to block potential hazards, specifically lasers, which may threaten the avatar's safety.\n2. The walls surrounding the avatar will limit movement, making it essential to effectively use the nearby ampersand to secure safety and continue progressing.\n3. By establishing a barrier with the ampersand, the avatar can avoid risks and plan subsequent moves toward the goal.\n\n**Strategy for Next Step:**\nGiven the immediate access to the ampersand, the strategy will focus on leveraging this item:\n\n1. **Interact with the Ampersand ('&')**: The first action should be to engage with the ampersand at (8, 2). This will create a protective barrier against any potential threats, ensuring the avatar\u2019s safety in the following turns.\n\n2. **Establish a Safer Pathway**: After engaging with the ampersand, the avatar will be positioned to navigate safely toward the goal, minimizing any risks from hazards present in the environment.\n\nIn summary, the strategy prioritizes utilizing the ampersand effectively to block threats, creating a safer path for future progression.\n\n```**Interact with the ampersand ('&') to block hazards and create a safer pathway toward the goal in subsequent moves.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n2,4,1,3,4,3,4,2,3,4,1,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0",
