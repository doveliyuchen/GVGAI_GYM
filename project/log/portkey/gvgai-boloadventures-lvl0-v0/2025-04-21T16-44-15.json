The interactions determine how the avatar behaves (e.g., bouncing back, being shielded, stepping back).\n  2. **Object Transformation:** Some interactions lead to the transformation of objects (e.g., boulders changing into boulderm). \n  3. **Hazards:** The avatar can be killed by lasers, depending on position (frontal vs. not frontal) and falls into holes.\n  4. **Goals:** The objective is to reach the goal to score points (5 points) and win the game.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite while avoiding hazards, manipulating boulders and boxes strategically, and possibly using the shield from boxes to block lasers.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the 'goal' sprite. This also grants a score change of 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses when the avatar [SpriteCounter] reaches zero, typically meaning the avatar is no longer present in the level.\n\n### Analysis of Level Layout:\nThe layout features walls (w), open spaces (.), and critical points marked with various sprites, including the goal (g) and boulders (b). The presence of lasers (c) indicates hazards that the player must navigate around or use strategically.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level's layout and the positioning of walls, lasers, and the goal.\n2. **Boulder Manipulation:** Use boulders strategically to block lasers or create paths. Remember that boulders can attract the gaze when transformed into boulderm, meaning they can be tactically moved to your advantage.\n3. **Box Shielding:** Utilize the box to shield yourself from frontal laser attacks. Strategically place it between you and lasers when approaching.\n4. **Avoid Hazards:** Stay away from holes and lasers as much as possible, using the walls to create safe paths.\n5. **Timing and Positioning:** Consider the timing of your movements, especially when dealing with hazards like lasers. Move in a way that minimizes exposure.\n6. **Incremental Progress:** Avoid rushing towards the goal; instead, take time to observe how objects interact and manipulate them slowly to clear your path.\n\nBy carefully maneuvering around obstacles and making intelligent use of the environmental elements, you can maximize your chances of successfully reaching the goal while minimizing the risk of losing the avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = *, col = *)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Interact with the box at (10, 1) to use it as a shield against lasers, enabling safe navigation toward the goal while remaining alert to potential hazards.**\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n",
