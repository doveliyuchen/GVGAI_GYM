For example:\n     - The `avatar` can bounce off a `box` or get eliminated by a `laser` if it encounters it frontally.\n     - There are mechanics for changing sprite behavior (e.g., transforming to different types).\n     - Strategic placement of boxes and boulders can change the landscape of the level, blocking lasers or clearing paths.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the `avatar` to reach the `goal` while avoiding hazards such as lasers and falling into holes. The player scores points by either reaching the goal or potentially by causing interactions that yield score changes (e.g., killing sprites or interacting in specific ways).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player **wins** by reaching the `goal`, which grants a score increase of 5.\n- The player **loses** if the `avatar` is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit for `avatar` reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements:**\n   - Assess the layout and interactions before moving. Consider the positions of holes, walls, and boulders before making a move to avoid getting trapped or killed.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Use boxes as shields against lasers and to manipulate the environment. For instance, you can place a box to block a laser's path or use it to bounce back from an imminent danger.\n\n3. **Manage Hazards:**\n   - Be aware of the positioning of boulders and holes\u2014try to lead boulders into holes to gain score points while simultaneously clearing paths.\n   - Keep track of the laser cannons and their direction; it may be strategic to destroy those immediately if they pose a threat.\n\n4. **Path Optimization:**\n   - Plan the optimal path to reach the goal, considering potential hazards and using blocks as necessary to create safety barriers or clear areas.\n\n5. **Exploration:**\n   - If the layout allows, explore corners and seemingly isolated areas for possible safe zones or alternative routes to the goal.\n\nBy understanding each element's role and strategically using the mechanics provided, the player can effectively navigate the game, maximize their score, and reach the goal without succumbing to loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

In this position, 'a' is adjacent to various obstacles and items:\n\n- **Near a wall**: The left side of the avatar is blocked by a wall, which limits movement options in that direction. \n- **Nearby Sprites**: There are multiple items and characters nearby:\n  - @ (potentially enemies or moving obstacles)\n  - * (part of the landscape or floors)\n  - % (possibly goals or interactive items that can grant a benefit)\n  - & (potentially an interaction point or item to exploit)\n  - # (a wall or solid barrier)\n  \n### Current Opportunities\nThe player can interact with the following elements:\n- **% (Points/Goal Items)**: Which are located at multiple positions (1, 12) and (2, 12).\n- **& (Interactive Item)**: There are two '&' symbols located at (6, 6) and (7, 6); engaging with them could provide dynamic responses in the game state.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\nGiven the current layout and the avatar's position, the most beneficial action would be to interact with the **% item**. This appears to symbolize point-earning opportunities which can contribute to achieving the goal of collecting points and potentially unlocking new paths or advantages.\n\nHowever, given that the 'a' cannot move directly into either of these without first navigating around the walls and obstacles nearby, the player must plan efficiently to reach there safely.\n\nThe immediate strategy will be to assess your interaction with these % items, aiming for scoring and advancing towards the goal.\n\n```**Interact with the % item to collect points and potentially unlock further strategies or routes.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The environment has changed significantly since the previous state:\n\n- The walls are now represented by 'b', which creates a solid border around the playable area.\n- The nearby layout consists of:\n  - **% Items**: Still present at coordinates (1, 12) and (2, 12).\n  - **@ Items**: Enemies are positioned at various points nearby, specifically at (1, 13), (2, 13), and (1, 10).\n  - **& Items**: Interactive items continue to be present at coordinates (6, 6) and (7, 6), which may still offer opportunities for beneficial interactions.\n\n### Current Opportunities\nThe most immediate and advantageous actions involve the following items and their locations:\n- **% (Point-earning item)**: Located at (1, 12) and (2, 12), ready for collection.\n- **& (Interactive item)**: Located at (6, 6) and (7, 6), which could provide useful mechanics or benefits to the player.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\nGiven the avatar's current position and surrounding obstacles, the focus should be on collecting the **% item** nearby. This collection not only contributes to the overall score but also might raise new strategic options or paths that could be useful in progressing toward the game's goal.\n\nHowever, similar to the previous analysis, the avatar must consider that direct access may still be hindered due to the positioning of walls and potential enemies.\n\nThus, the strategy is clear: prioritize interacting with the % item to maximize scoring.\n\n```**Interact with the % item to collect points and potentially unlock further strategies or routes.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Consider the positions of holes, walls, and boulders before making a move to avoid getting trapped or killed.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Use boxes as shields against lasers and to manipulate the environment. For instance, you can place a box to block a laser's path or use it to bounce back from an imminent danger.\n\n3. **Manage Hazards:**\n   - Be aware of the positioning of boulders and holes\u2014try to lead boulders into holes to gain score points while simultaneously clearing paths.\n   - Keep track of the laser cannons and their direction; it may be strategic to destroy those immediately if they pose a threat.\n\n4. **Path Optimization:**\n   - Plan the optimal path to reach the goal, considering potential hazards and using blocks as necessary to create safety barriers or clear areas.\n\n5. **Exploration:**\n   - If the layout allows, explore corners and seemingly isolated areas for possible safe zones or alternative routes to the goal.\n\nBy understanding each element's role and strategically using the mechanics provided, the player can effectively navigate the game, maximize their score, and reach the goal without succumbing to loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Collecting these items is advantageous for scoring points.\n- **@ items** (potential enemies) are present in the vicinity but do not pose a direct threat to the avatar at this moment since they are not adjacent to it.\n\n### Current Opportunities\nThe avatar has the opportunity to interact with:\n- **% (Point-earning items)** at (1, 12) and (2, 12). Collecting these will directly add to the score.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\nGiven the objectives of maximizing points and the absence of immediate threats, the best action is to interact with the **% item** at (1, 12). This will allow the avatar to earn points, aligning with the goals of the game.\n\nSince the avatar is adjacent to the item, there are no barriers obstructing this interaction.\n\n```**Interact with the % item at (1, 12) to collect points and progress toward achieving your game objectives.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Collecting these items will yield points, and they are directly accessible from the avatar's current position.\n- **@ items** (enemies) are present in the environment but do not pose a threat at the moment due to their distance from the avatar.\n\n### Current Opportunities\nThe best opportunity for the avatar is to interact with the **% item** located at (1, 12). This item is easily reachable and contributes directly to the game's scoring system.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\nConsidering the advantages of collecting the % item, the logical and goal-oriented action is to interact with this item.

For example:\n     - The `avatar` can bounce off a `box` or get eliminated by a `laser` if it encounters it frontally.\n     - There are mechanics for changing sprite behavior (e.g., transforming to different types).\n     - Strategic placement of boxes and boulders can change the landscape of the level, blocking lasers or clearing paths.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the `avatar` to reach the `goal` while avoiding hazards such as lasers and falling into holes. The player scores points by either reaching the goal or potentially by causing interactions that yield score changes (e.g., killing sprites or interacting in specific ways).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player **wins** by reaching the `goal`, which grants a score increase of 5.\n- The player **loses** if the `avatar` is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit for `avatar` reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements:**\n   - Assess the layout and interactions before moving. Consider the positions of holes, walls, and boulders before making a move to avoid getting trapped or killed.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Use boxes as shields against lasers and to manipulate the environment. For instance, you can place a box to block a laser's path or use it to bounce back from an imminent danger.\n\n3. **Manage Hazards:**\n   - Be aware of the positioning of boulders and holes\u2014try to lead boulders into holes to gain score points while simultaneously clearing paths.\n   - Keep track of the laser cannons and their direction; it may be strategic to destroy those immediately if they pose a threat.\n\n4. **Path Optimization:**\n   - Plan the optimal path to reach the goal, considering potential hazards and using blocks as necessary to create safety barriers or clear areas.\n\n5. **Exploration:**\n   - If the layout allows, explore corners and seemingly isolated areas for possible safe zones or alternative routes to the goal.\n\nBy understanding each element's role and strategically using the mechanics provided, the player can effectively navigate the game, maximize their score, and reach the goal without succumbing to loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

This item is directly adjacent to the avatar and presents a straightforward opportunity to gain points without any risk from nearby enemies or barriers.\n\n### Goal-Oriented Strategy\nGiven the proximity and safety of the **% item**, the optimal strategy is to interact with it to collect points. This interaction fulfills one of the key objectives in the game\u2014scoring\u2014and ensures that the avatar continues to progress toward the overall goal of reaching the end point and maximizing points.\n\nThis action is unimpeded by any obstacles or threats, and therefore presents a practical and beneficial step forward.\n\n```**Interact with the % item at (1, 12) to collect points and advance toward achieving your game objectives.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
