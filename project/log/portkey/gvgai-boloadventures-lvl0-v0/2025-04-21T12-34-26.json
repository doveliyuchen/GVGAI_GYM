The presence of strategic interactions and the requirement to navigate a space while avoiding hazards is characteristic of this genre.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Objects**: Players control an avatar that interacts with various objects such as walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Movement**: The avatar can bounce off boxes, attract boulders, and move backward upon colliding with walls or lasers, which indicates a control mechanism where positioning and timing are key.\n- **Transformations and Hazards**: Certain interactions lead to transformations (e.g., boulders becoming missiles) or consequences such as death or scoring, suggesting a combination of strategy and trial-and-error gameplay.\n- **Scoring System**: The player can score points by achieving specific conditions, particularly by reaching the goal or interacting with certain elements effectively. \n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite located in the level while avoiding hazards and making the correct movements to maximize points.\n- Interacting with the laser can lead to an avatar's death if it is unshielded, and the game incorporates a point-scoring system where reaching the goal provides a score increase.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which also signifies the completion of the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite counter reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`), indicating that the avatar has died too many times.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify where hazards like lasers and boulders are located and plan routes accordingly.\n   \n2. **Utilize Blocks Strategically**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal lasers, allowing you to navigate safely through dangerous areas. This will also help you bounce forward past obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Maintain awareness of where potential dangers are. Use the walls to your advantage, and move away from where lasers are positioned, taking note of their directions.\n\n4. **Prioritize Goal Access**: Always prioritize reaching the goal while managing hazards. As you approach the goal, ensure that any boulders or other dangers are in a safe location, so they do not hinder your progress.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Consider interactions that yield score increases, such as engaging with \"hole\" interactions that can reward bonuses, while still navigating safely to the goal.\n\nOverall, the player must balance exploration, puzzle-solving, and tactical movement to successfully navigate the level and achieve a high score before the avatar runs out of lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Surrounding 'a', there are several obstacles and items. To the north, there is a wall, to the south, there are various interactive elements including a boulder, and the goal reward icons are present further to the right and below in the grid. \n\n### Available Items for Interaction\nAt this position, the immediate items 'a' can interact with include:\n- The boulder (denoted as '*'), which can be moved, potentially allowing for clearing a path or using it to shield against hazards.\n- The 'movement items' (indicated as '@') which may facilitate movement or further interaction, primarily to the right.\n- There are also other item types like '&', which might allow for additional strategic actions, and '%' that seem to represent scoring opportunities.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\nGiven the current state with 'a' positioned near items and hazards, the best course of action is to interact with the boulder (`*`). Moving or utilizing this boulder can open up paths by either clearing space towards the right where several goals and rewards are positioned while allowing safe navigation via the items in the vicinity.\n\nWorking with this boulder may also unsettle hazards or create protective shields against potentially harmful interactions like lasers nearby.\n\nSince the wall blocks upward movement and the goal lies further from the current position, engaging the boulder provides a pivotal step in orchestrating subsequent movements toward the goal.\n\nGiven all these considerations, the abstract strategy for the next step is: \n\n```**Interact with the boulder to create pathways towards the right, facilitating opened access to goals and additional scoring opportunities while ensuring safety against hazards.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

There's a pattern of boulders, boxes, and walls blocking most passages, complicating immediate movement options. \n\nWith the previous strategy involving an attempt to interact with boulders not feasible in the current state, the focus now shifts to the use of the interactive item '&'.\n\n### Available Items for Interaction\nThe items directly accessible are:\n- **Ampersand ('&')**: Located at (2, 11) and (3, 11). This item seems relevant for an interaction that could potentially unlock further movement or a strategic utility needed to get past the walls blocking the path to the goal.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\nGiven the constraints imposed by the walls and the available resources, the next optimal step is to interact with the item '&' at (2, 11). Engaging with this item may provide an opportunity for either additional movement options or utility to manipulate the surrounding obstacles, which would facilitate a path toward the goal and allow the avatar to bypass the walls effectively.\n\nSince the surroundings remain heavily walled, focusing on maximizing the use of the '&' item can provide a way to reposition or enable movement towards other interactive elements or ultimately towards the goal.\n\nThus, the abstract strategy for the next step is:\n\n```**Interact with the item '&' at (2, 11) to potentially unlock new movement options or effects that can help navigate past the walls and towards the goal.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The presence of strategic interactions and the requirement to navigate a space while avoiding hazards is characteristic of this genre.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Objects**: Players control an avatar that interacts with various objects such as walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Movement**: The avatar can bounce off boxes, attract boulders, and move backward upon colliding with walls or lasers, which indicates a control mechanism where positioning and timing are key.\n- **Transformations and Hazards**: Certain interactions lead to transformations (e.g., boulders becoming missiles) or consequences such as death or scoring, suggesting a combination of strategy and trial-and-error gameplay.\n- **Scoring System**: The player can score points by achieving specific conditions, particularly by reaching the goal or interacting with certain elements effectively. \n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite located in the level while avoiding hazards and making the correct movements to maximize points.\n- Interacting with the laser can lead to an avatar's death if it is unshielded, and the game incorporates a point-scoring system where reaching the goal provides a score increase.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which also signifies the completion of the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite counter reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`), indicating that the avatar has died too many times.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify where hazards like lasers and boulders are located and plan routes accordingly.\n   \n2. **Utilize Blocks Strategically**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal lasers, allowing you to navigate safely through dangerous areas. This will also help you bounce forward past obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Maintain awareness of where potential dangers are. Use the walls to your advantage, and move away from where lasers are positioned, taking note of their directions.\n\n4. **Prioritize Goal Access**: Always prioritize reaching the goal while managing hazards. As you approach the goal, ensure that any boulders or other dangers are in a safe location, so they do not hinder your progress.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Consider interactions that yield score increases, such as engaging with \"hole\" interactions that can reward bonuses, while still navigating safely to the goal.\n\nOverall, the player must balance exploration, puzzle-solving, and tactical movement to successfully navigate the level and achieve a high score before the avatar runs out of lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The presence of strategic interactions and the requirement to navigate a space while avoiding hazards is characteristic of this genre.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Objects**: Players control an avatar that interacts with various objects such as walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Movement**: The avatar can bounce off boxes, attract boulders, and move backward upon colliding with walls or lasers, which indicates a control mechanism where positioning and timing are key.\n- **Transformations and Hazards**: Certain interactions lead to transformations (e.g., boulders becoming missiles) or consequences such as death or scoring, suggesting a combination of strategy and trial-and-error gameplay.\n- **Scoring System**: The player can score points by achieving specific conditions, particularly by reaching the goal or interacting with certain elements effectively. \n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite located in the level while avoiding hazards and making the correct movements to maximize points.\n- Interacting with the laser can lead to an avatar's death if it is unshielded, and the game incorporates a point-scoring system where reaching the goal provides a score increase.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which also signifies the completion of the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite counter reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`), indicating that the avatar has died too many times.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify where hazards like lasers and boulders are located and plan routes accordingly.\n   \n2. **Utilize Blocks Strategically**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal lasers, allowing you to navigate safely through dangerous areas.

The presence of strategic interactions and the requirement to navigate a space while avoiding hazards is characteristic of this genre.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Objects**: Players control an avatar that interacts with various objects such as walls, boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Movement**: The avatar can bounce off boxes, attract boulders, and move backward upon colliding with walls or lasers, which indicates a control mechanism where positioning and timing are key.\n- **Transformations and Hazards**: Certain interactions lead to transformations (e.g., boulders becoming missiles) or consequences such as death or scoring, suggesting a combination of strategy and trial-and-error gameplay.\n- **Scoring System**: The player can score points by achieving specific conditions, particularly by reaching the goal or interacting with certain elements effectively. \n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is to navigate the avatar to the **goal** sprite located in the level while avoiding hazards and making the correct movements to maximize points.\n- Interacting with the laser can lead to an avatar's death if it is unshielded, and the game incorporates a point-scoring system where reaching the goal provides a score increase.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`), which also signifies the completion of the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the avatar sprite counter reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`), indicating that the avatar has died too many times.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify where hazards like lasers and boulders are located and plan routes accordingly.\n   \n2. **Utilize Blocks Strategically**: Use the boxes to shield against frontal lasers, allowing you to navigate safely through dangerous areas. This will also help you bounce forward past obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Maintain awareness of where potential dangers are. Use the walls to your advantage, and move away from where lasers are positioned, taking note of their directions.\n\n4. **Prioritize Goal Access**: Always prioritize reaching the goal while managing hazards. As you approach the goal, ensure that any boulders or other dangers are in a safe location, so they do not hinder your progress.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Consider interactions that yield score increases, such as engaging with \"hole\" interactions that can reward bonuses, while still navigating safely to the goal.\n\nOverall, the player must balance exploration, puzzle-solving, and tactical movement to successfully navigate the level and achieve a high score before the avatar runs out of lives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(2, 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(2,1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Analysis of Current Location\nThe avatar 'a' is located at (2, 11). Surrounded by walls (denoted as 'b'), the only opportunity for interaction is the ampersand ('&') directly below at (3, 11). The goal is located far to the right at (0, 19), but current barriers prevent direct access. To progress, the avatar must interact with the '&' to possibly unlock capabilities that will help clear obstacles or enhance movement options.\n\n### Available Items for Interaction\n- **Ampersand ('&')**: Positioned at (3, 11). Engaging with this item is critical as it likely offers new abilities or pathways necessary for overcoming the walls and reaching the goal.\n\n### High-Level Strategy\nGiven the constraints of the environment and the importance of advancing toward the goal, the next optimal action is to interact with the ampersand ('&'). This interaction is vital because it may lead to significant changes that allow the avatar to bypass walls or gain new movement abilities essential for navigating the level.\n\nTherefore, the abstract strategy for the next step is:\n\n```**Interact with the item '&' at (3, 11) to unlock new capabilities that facilitate navigation toward the goal and maneuvering through existing obstacles effectively.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
