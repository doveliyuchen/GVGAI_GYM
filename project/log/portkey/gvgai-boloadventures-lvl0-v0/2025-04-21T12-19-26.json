The player's avatar navigates the environment, encountering obstacles and utilizing various mechanics to progress to a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game employs a set of unique mechanics that revolve around interaction and transformation of sprites. Here\u2019s a breakdown of key mechanics:\n\n1. **Sprites**: Various game elements are defined as sprites, including immovable objects (ground, wall, hole, goal), movable/passive elements (boxes, boulders), and projectiles (laser).\n2. **Avatar Actions**: The player-controlled avatar interacts with the game world in specific ways:\n   - **Bouncing and Shielding**: The avatar can bounce off boxes and shield itself from lasers through strategic placement.\n   - **Movement Constraints**: There are consequences to hitting walls, as the avatar is pushed back upon collision, which adds an element of strategic positioning.\n3. **Interactivity**:\n   - The mechanics allow for transformations (e.g., boulders turning into missiles when interacted with certain elements).\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar based on the direction of the interaction, creating a need for careful navigation.\n\n4. **Goal and Scoring**: The avatar must reach the goal (denoted as 'g') while avoiding obstacles like lasers and boulders to increase the score. Reaching the goal earns additional points.\n\n#### Objective\n- **Primary Objective**: Navigate from the starting position (marked as 'A') to the goal (marked as 'g') located within a grid-like level while avoiding death from lasers and ensuring successful interactions with elements.\n- **Scoring**: Points are gained by interacting with certain elements (e.g., scoring points for interacting with a hole and reaching the goal).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, which is influenced by interactions with killing elements like lasers or falling into holes.\n- **Win**: The player achieves victory when the avatar reaches the goal markings while navigating the level.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Start by visualizing the level layout and identifying pathways, hazards, and potential safe zones. Note the positions of walls, holes, and the goal relative to the starting point (A).\n   \n2. **Use Box Shields**: Utilize boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers and create safe pathways through the level. Placing boxes between the avatar and lasers can allow more freedom of movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Frontal Collisions**: Since the avatar faces danger from frontal interactions with lasers, maintain constant awareness of the avatar\u2019s positioning relative to the hazards. If lasers are present, do not approach them head-on or plan routes that minimize potential frontal clashes.\n\n4. **Boulder Management**: Consider how to utilize or navigate around boulders effectively. Avoid collisions that may transform the avatar into a boulderm (which appears to attract laser attention).\n\n5. **Goal Orientation**: Always keep the goal in mind; weigh the risk of pursuing points versus the necessity of reaching the goal. It can be beneficial to prioritize reaching the goal over accumulating points if the risk becomes too high.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: The game likely rewards experimentation, so feel free to try out different strategies to see which interactions yield the best results for safe navigation to the goal.\n\nBy strategically managing interactions and carefully navigating the level, players can effectively work towards achieving the game's win conditions while minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Below, at (6, 11), there is a boulder. There is a hole above at (4, 11).\n\n### Identifying Interactable Objects\n\n1. **Boulder (at (6, 11))**: The most immediate interactable object is the boulder directly beneath the avatar. Interacting with the boulder may allow for movement opportunities or transformation effects.\n2. **Hole (at (4, 11))**: This is a potential hazard but also an interactable object. However, because falling into a hole would result in a loss of the avatar, it is best to avoid it as a first choice of action.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\n1. **Immediate Action**: The logical and safe choice is to move downward to interact with the boulder. This option can potentially lead to creating a new path or allow the boulder to be manipulated for space to move.\n2. **Long-Term Goal**: After moving down and interacting with the boulder, reassess the new surrounding area for further moves towards the goal positioned at (5, 14) while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state and layout, moving down provides a pathway to progress without falling into a hole. Thus, the decision is to engage with the nearest boulder to explore further movement options.\n\n```**Move down to interact with the boulder (to potentially unlock new movement opportunities).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Interacting with the boulder could open new pathways or change its state depending on the game mechanics.\n2. **Hole at (4, 11)**: This is an interactable but poses a risk as falling into it would result in a loss for the avatar.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\n1. **Current Situation**: The avatar is trapped between solid walls on either side and confronted with two hazardous choices: a boulder beneath or a hole above.\n2. **Immediate Action**: The best course of action is to move down and interact with the boulder at (6, 11). This interaction may provide an opportunity to manipulate the boulder, potentially creating paths or changing the level's configuration.\n\n3. **Long-Term Goal**: After interacting with the boulder, reassess the new configuration. The goal at (5, 14) is not directly reachable now, but engaging effectively with the boulder could help in establishing a path toward it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the state of the game and the current environmental conditions, moving down to engage with the boulder is the most strategic and safest choice to advance and explore potential paths to the goal.\n\n```**Move down to interact with the boulder (to possibly clear a path or change its state for further movement).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Reaching the goal earns additional points.\n\n#### Objective\n- **Primary Objective**: Navigate from the starting position (marked as 'A') to the goal (marked as 'g') located within a grid-like level while avoiding death from lasers and ensuring successful interactions with elements.\n- **Scoring**: Points are gained by interacting with certain elements (e.g., scoring points for interacting with a hole and reaching the goal).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, which is influenced by interactions with killing elements like lasers or falling into holes.\n- **Win**: The player achieves victory when the avatar reaches the goal markings while navigating the level.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Start by visualizing the level layout and identifying pathways, hazards, and potential safe zones. Note the positions of walls, holes, and the goal relative to the starting point (A).\n   \n2. **Use Box Shields**: Utilize boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers and create safe pathways through the level. Placing boxes between the avatar and lasers can allow more freedom of movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Frontal Collisions**: Since the avatar faces danger from frontal interactions with lasers, maintain constant awareness of the avatar\u2019s positioning relative to the hazards. If lasers are present, do not approach them head-on or plan routes that minimize potential frontal clashes.\n\n4. **Boulder Management**: Consider how to utilize or navigate around boulders effectively. Avoid collisions that may transform the avatar into a boulderm (which appears to attract laser attention).\n\n5. **Goal Orientation**: Always keep the goal in mind; weigh the risk of pursuing points versus the necessity of reaching the goal. It can be beneficial to prioritize reaching the goal over accumulating points if the risk becomes too high.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: The game likely rewards experimentation, so feel free to try out different strategies to see which interactions yield the best results for safe navigation to the goal.\n\nBy strategically managing interactions and carefully navigating the level, players can effectively work towards achieving the game's win conditions while minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of surrounding elements:\n\n- **Walls**: There are walls immediately to the left (5, 10) and right (5, 12).\n- **Boulders**: There is a boulder directly below the avatar at (6, 11).\n- **Hole**: Directly above the avatar at (4, 11).\n- **Goal**: The goal is located at (5, 14).\n\n### Identifying Interactable Objects\n\n1. **Boulder (6, 11)**: This is the only immediate item available for interaction below the avatar. Interacting with it could potentially create space or allow for further movements.\n2. **Hole (4, 11)**: While it's also an interactable element, moving up towards it would lead to falling into a hole, which results in a loss.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\n1. **Immediate Action**: The most logical move is to interact with the boulder by moving down to (6, 11). This interaction may enable the avatar to change the state or position of the boulder, potentially allowing for further movement options afterward.\n\n2. **Long-Term Consideration**: After interacting with the boulder, assess the new layout. Look for paths towards the goal at (5, 14) and avoid getting stuck between walls or hazards.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Refrain from moving up towards the hole as it leads to immediate loss for the avatar. The walls on either side restrict lateral movement, making the vertical interaction with the boulder crucial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven these considerations, the avatar's immediate move toward the boulder is strategic and necessary for further navigation towards the goal.\n\n```**Move down to interact with the boulder at (6, 11).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Note the positions of walls, holes, and the goal relative to the starting point (A).\n   \n2. **Use Box Shields**: Utilize boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers and create safe pathways through the level. Placing boxes between the avatar and lasers can allow more freedom of movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Frontal Collisions**: Since the avatar faces danger from frontal interactions with lasers, maintain constant awareness of the avatar\u2019s positioning relative to the hazards. If lasers are present, do not approach them head-on or plan routes that minimize potential frontal clashes.\n\n4. **Boulder Management**: Consider how to utilize or navigate around boulders effectively. Avoid collisions that may transform the avatar into a boulderm (which appears to attract laser attention).\n\n5. **Goal Orientation**: Always keep the goal in mind; weigh the risk of pursuing points versus the necessity of reaching the goal. It can be beneficial to prioritize reaching the goal over accumulating points if the risk becomes too high.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: The game likely rewards experimentation, so feel free to try out different strategies to see which interactions yield the best results for safe navigation to the goal.\n\nBy strategically managing interactions and carefully navigating the level, players can effectively work towards achieving the game's win conditions while minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Reaching the goal earns additional points.\n\n#### Objective\n- **Primary Objective**: Navigate from the starting position (marked as 'A') to the goal (marked as 'g') located within a grid-like level while avoiding death from lasers and ensuring successful interactions with elements.\n- **Scoring**: Points are gained by interacting with certain elements (e.g., scoring points for interacting with a hole and reaching the goal).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, which is influenced by interactions with killing elements like lasers or falling into holes.\n- **Win**: The player achieves victory when the avatar reaches the goal markings while navigating the level.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Start by visualizing the level layout and identifying pathways, hazards, and potential safe zones. Note the positions of walls, holes, and the goal relative to the starting point (A).\n   \n2. **Use Box Shields**: Utilize boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers and create safe pathways through the level. Placing boxes between the avatar and lasers can allow more freedom of movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Frontal Collisions**: Since the avatar faces danger from frontal interactions with lasers, maintain constant awareness of the avatar\u2019s positioning relative to the hazards. If lasers are present, do not approach them head-on or plan routes that minimize potential frontal clashes.\n\n4. **Boulder Management**: Consider how to utilize or navigate around boulders effectively. Avoid collisions that may transform the avatar into a boulderm (which appears to attract laser attention).\n\n5. **Goal Orientation**: Always keep the goal in mind; weigh the risk of pursuing points versus the necessity of reaching the goal. It can be beneficial to prioritize reaching the goal over accumulating points if the risk becomes too high.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: The game likely rewards experimentation, so feel free to try out different strategies to see which interactions yield the best results for safe navigation to the goal.\n\nBy strategically managing interactions and carefully navigating the level, players can effectively work towards achieving the game's win conditions while minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Avatar Position and Analysis\n\nThe avatar is located at (5, 11). The immediate surroundings consist of:\n\n- **Walls**: \n  - Left (5, 10)\n  - Right (5, 12)\n- **Boulder**: Located directly below at (6, 11).\n- **Hole**: Situated directly above at (4, 11), which presents a danger.\n- **Goal**: Positioned at (5, 14).\n\n### Identifying Interactable Objects\n\n1. **Boulder (6, 11)**: This is the only nearby interactable object that the avatar can engage with directly below. Interacting with it may allow the avatar to move it or change the game state by changing its arrangement, potentially opening pathways.\n2. **Hole (4, 11)**: Moving up to this hole would cause the avatar to fall, leading to a game loss.\n\n### Strategy Development\n\n1. **Immediate Action**: The best course of action is to **move down** to interact with the boulder at (6, 11). This interaction can lead to:\n   - Possible movement of the boulder, creating new pathways.\n   - Alteration of its state, opening up new strategic options.\n\n2. **Post-Interaction Assessment**: After engaging with the boulder, the avatar should reassess its surroundings to look for new routes leading to the goal at (5, 14), while remaining cautious of walls and the hole.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Ensure that no attempts are made to move up towards the hole at (4, 11), as it will lead to an immediate game loss.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the walls blocking lateral movement and the need to explore paths toward the goal, the only viable action is to interact with the boulder located directly below the avatar.\n\n```**Move down to interact with the boulder at (6, 11).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
