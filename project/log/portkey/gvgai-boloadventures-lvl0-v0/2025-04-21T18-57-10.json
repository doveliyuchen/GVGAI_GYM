Utilize boxes to shield from lasers effectively.\n\n2. **Plan Movement Steps**: \n   - Using walls and other nearby sprites strategically can help steer the avatar away from hazards. Use the boulder and box wisely to block laser fire.\n\n3. **Maximize Score Through Hazards**: \n   - Take advantage of the interactions that change the state of sprites; interacting with a boulder can allow players to create new paths or manipulate enemy sprites for advantageous positioning.\n\n4. **Path Finding**: \n   - Explore multiple routes towards the goal. If one route appears blocked or hazardous, consider backtracking and finding paths with fewer dangers.\n\n5. **Careful Planning Around Hazards**: \n   - Approach the goal with caution, ensuring the avatar isn\u2019t in a position to be immediately hit by lasers or smashed by boulders. \n\n6. **Test Various Interactions**: \n   - Experiment with different interactions, like colliding with boxes and boulders, to better understand mechanics such as bouncing forward or triggering traps.\n\nBy leveraging interactions, mapping out safe pathways, and maintaining a focus on the goal while managing hazards, players can increase their chances of winning while maximizing their scoring potential.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.
