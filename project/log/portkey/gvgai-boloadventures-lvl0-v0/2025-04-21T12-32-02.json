It features platforming elements (like an avatar moving through a level) and requires strategic thinking to navigate obstacles and achieve objectives.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites (e.g., walls, holes, boulders, lasers) that have specific properties and interactions.\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - **Avatar**: Player-controlled character that can interact with other sprites (e.g., walls, boxes, boulders).\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: These can interact with each other and with the avatar to alter their states (e.g., transform to different types, push the avatar back).\n   - **Lasers**: Dangerous obstacles that can kill the avatar if contacted in a certain manner.\n   - **Goal**: The objective to reach, which provides score points upon successful interaction with the avatar.\n\n3. **States**: Sprites can have different states influenced by their interactions (e.g., walls can be immovable, while the avatar can be transformed or killed).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the goal sprite (denoted as 'g'), which will result in the avatar being \"killed\" (removed from play) and granting score changes. The player must likely avoid hazards and navigate obstacles to reach this goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Achieved when the avatar successfully interacts with the goal sprite; this results in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is removed from play due to reaching a sprite counter limit of 0 (implying the avatar has been \"killed\" or removed) or if they encounter a laser in a frontal collision, as indicated by the interaction rules.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: The avatar must navigate the level without directly engaging the lasers. Keep an eye on the orientations and possible movement paths.\n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders Strategically**:\n   - Utilize boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks and to manipulate the environment. Position them to block lasers while maneuvering the avatar.\n   - Move boulders only when safe, and understand that they can 'attract gaze' which may serve a tactical purpose in some scenarios.\n   - Understand that boxes may bounce the avatar when interacted with, so positioning is key to avoid unintended movements.\n3. **Plan a Route**: Look for the shortest and safest path to the goal while adhering to the interactions allowed.\n4. **Test Interactions**: Exploit the interactions to find creative solutions to problems, like creating barriers against lasers using boxes and boulders.\n5. **Incremental Progress**: Move carefully, ensuring to test different interactions before committing to a specific strategy.\n\nBy understanding how each element interacts and moving cautiously, players can effectively navigate the challenges and reach the goal safely, scoring points in the process.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(1, 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(0,0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Analysis of Current Location\nThe current location of the avatar 'a' is (1, 11). From this position, the surrounding area can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- **North (0, 11)**: A wall (*), blocking any upward movement.\n- **South (2, 11)**: A wall (*), blocking any downward movement.\n- **West (1, 10)**: An open space (.), allowing lateral movement.\n- **East (1, 12)**: A wall (%), blocking rightward movement.\n\nThe only move available is to the west, to position (1, 10). This move allows the avatar to get closer to other possible interactions.\n\n### Potential Items to Interact With\nAt position (1, 10), the avatar can interact with any objects present nearby. However, the only immediate option near the avatar after moving west is to explore the open space and determine what lies ahead, as there are no items directly in the current vicinity but rather access to adjacent spaces.\n\n### Action Strategy\n- **Goal**: The immediate goal is to continue exploring and identify potential interactions or pathways while avoiding obstacles.\n- **Target Item**: Although the area does not present immediate items, continuing to probe west (to (1, 10)) may lead to further exploration options, such as:\n  - Moving either farther west into (1, 9) if it is unblocked, leading to new interactions.\n  - Assessing any uncounted items or escaping dangerous sprite interactions by finding escape routes.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and lack of immediate objects to interact with, the best strategy is:\n1. Move the avatar to (1, 10).\n2. Continue west or inspect surrounding movements with caution.\n  \nThis allows for maximum exploration of the area without encountering walls or hazardous sprites.\n\n```**Move west to (1, 10) and continue exploring the area to identify any further items or actions.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Evaluating the surrounding area:\n\n- **North (0, 11)**: Wall (b), blocking upward movement.\n- **South (2, 11)**: Wall (b), blocking downward movement.\n- **West (1, 10)**: Open space (.), available for lateral movement.\n- **East (1, 12)**: Wall (%), blocking rightward movement.\n\nThe avatar is confined on its north, south, and east sides due to walls. The only option to move is to the west (1, 10). However, the next step can also involve interaction with items if they appear in subsequent positions as exploration continues.\n\n### Potential Items to Interact With\nBased on the surrounding area after the avatar moves to (1, 10):\n- At (1, 10), there is no immediate item to interact with.\n- Moving further west to (1, 9) would allow the exploration of the same area, and there is a reachable goal item below (likely sushi or a collectible according to your game context).\n\n### Action Strategy\nGiven that the avatar is positioned against significant blocking elements, the best course of action is:\n1. **Move the avatar left to (1, 10)** to explore.\n2. **From (1, 10), move left again to (1, 9)**.\n3. In (1, 9), it will be essential to check further options down or lateral, where other items or exit routes may be located further below the level indicated by outcomes.\n\nTarget item interactions for next states (potentially at intersection points) would need exploration across mapped coordinates.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe avatar must navigate through available spaces, particularly focusing on moving through the walls to access areas where items might be found or to arrive closer to pathways that lead to the ultimate goal.\n\n```**Move west to (1, 10) and then further west to (1, 9) to explore potential item interactions and pathways.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Position them to block lasers while maneuvering the avatar.\n   - Move boulders only when safe, and understand that they can 'attract gaze' which may serve a tactical purpose in some scenarios.\n   - Understand that boxes may bounce the avatar when interacted with, so positioning is key to avoid unintended movements.\n3. **Plan a Route**: Look for the shortest and safest path to the goal while adhering to the interactions allowed.\n4. **Test Interactions**: Exploit the interactions to find creative solutions to problems, like creating barriers against lasers using boxes and boulders.\n5. **Incremental Progress**: Move carefully, ensuring to test different interactions before committing to a specific strategy.\n\nBy understanding how each element interacts and moving cautiously, players can effectively navigate the challenges and reach the goal safely, scoring points in the process.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.
