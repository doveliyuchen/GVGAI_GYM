Assess each move carefully to avoid being killed by a laser.\n\n5. **Keep Goals in Mind:**\n   Maintain awareness of the location of the goal. Always work towards it as efficiently as possible, overcoming barriers as they arise.\n\n6. **Manage Risk:**\n   If the player finds themselves facing a potentially game-ending situation (like being surrounded by hazards with limited moves), retreat to safety to reassess the strategy.\n\nThrough cautious movement, strategic use of boxes, and constant assessment of the environment, players can successfully navigate to the goal and achieve victory while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.
