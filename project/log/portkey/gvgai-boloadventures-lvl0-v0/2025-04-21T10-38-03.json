For example, knowing that the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks can be a key tactical advantage when navigating near lasers.\n\n2. **Plan Movement**: Carefully plan the avatar's movements to avoid hazards. Use walls and other structures to \u2018bounce\u2019 or block attacks while finding paths to the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Objects Wisely**: \n   - Use boxes to shield from lasers when necessary, ensuring movement is controlled and calculated.\n   - The boulders can potentially be moved to manipulate hazards or interact with the walls to create paths.\n  \n4. **Be Cautious with Hazards**: Always be aware of laser directions and the presence of holes. The avatar should avoid direct paths that would lead into dangers.\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Paths**: The level layout suggests various routes; explore and find the most efficient way to avoid hazards while still making progress toward the goal.\n\n6. **Revisit Areas**: If stuck or uncertain, it\u2019s often useful to retrace steps or reconsider previous areas using different object interaction tactics to open new paths.\n\nBy utilizing a combination of these strategies and being mindful of interactions, players can create a successful path to the goal while navigating the challenges presented in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The nearest boulder is strategically placed and can be pushed to alter the game's layout.\n\n2. **Push the Boulder**: Move the nearest boulder to create a barrier or platform. This action can help in two ways:\n   - It can block potential hazards, particularly nearby holes.\n   - It may create a more favorable path for the avatar to navigate toward the goal.\n\n3. **Evaluate Post-Move Environment**: After pushing the boulder, reassess the surrounding space to see if new pathways or openings have been created that lead toward the goal ($).\n\n4. **Plan Next Steps**: Depending on the configuration after moving the boulder, decide on the next action to continue progressing toward the goal. This may involve further interactions with other objects such as the box or additional boulders.\n\n5. **Explore Additional Interactions**: If pushing the boulder does not clearly open a path to the goal, look for other interactable elements nearby and determine if they can be utilized to navigate or alter the environment further.\n\n### Final Note\nPushing the boulder is a critical step to manipulate the environment and can aid in safely navigating to the goal. After this interaction, continuously assess the game state for the best paths and potential further interactions needed to achieve the objective.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

For example, knowing that the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks can be a key tactical advantage when navigating near lasers.\n\n2. **Plan Movement**: Carefully plan the avatar's movements to avoid hazards. Use walls and other structures to \u2018bounce\u2019 or block attacks while finding paths to the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Objects Wisely**: \n   - Use boxes to shield from lasers when necessary, ensuring movement is controlled and calculated.\n   - The boulders can potentially be moved to manipulate hazards or interact with the walls to create paths.\n  \n4. **Be Cautious with Hazards**: Always be aware of laser directions and the presence of holes.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided rules and level layout, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**, characterized by the interaction of elements in the environment where the player must solve puzzles (generally involving the use of blocks and other elements) to reach a goal while navigating hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features several sprites, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Immovable Objects**: This includes walls and ground that define the play area.\n   - **Hazards**: Such as holes and lasers that can eliminate the avatar if hit.\n   - **Passive Objects**: Boxes and boulders that can be moved or interacted with.\n   - **Goals**: The ultimate objective is represented by the 'goal' sprite.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with different objects like boxes, walls, boulders, and lasers.\n   - The gameplay includes bouncing, shielding, transforming, and elimination based on the interactions.\n   - Hazards and obstacles can either kill the avatar or force it to step back.\n\n### Objective\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar to the 'goal' sprite while avoiding hazards.\n- Collecting points and avoiding being eliminated are secondary objectives, with a score change associated with reaching the goal (+5 points) and eliminating certain sprites.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins the game if they reach the goal (the 'goal' sprite is touched).\n- The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' reaches limit 0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Explore Interactions**: Players should take time to understand how different sprites interact. For example, knowing that the box can shield the avatar from frontal attacks can be a key tactical advantage when navigating near lasers.\n\n2. **Plan Movement**: Carefully plan the avatar's movements to avoid hazards. Use walls and other structures to \u2018bounce\u2019 or block attacks while finding paths to the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Objects Wisely**: \n   - Use boxes to shield from lasers when necessary, ensuring movement is controlled and calculated.\n   - The boulders can potentially be moved to manipulate hazards or interact with the walls to create paths.\n  \n4. **Be Cautious with Hazards**: Always be aware of laser directions and the presence of holes. The avatar should avoid direct paths that would lead into dangers.\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Paths**: The level layout suggests various routes; explore and find the most efficient way to avoid hazards while still making progress toward the goal.\n\n6. **Revisit Areas**: If stuck or uncertain, it\u2019s often useful to retrace steps or reconsider previous areas using different object interaction tactics to open new paths.\n\nBy utilizing a combination of these strategies and being mindful of interactions, players can create a successful path to the goal while navigating the challenges presented in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

This will create a safer passage for the avatar as it navigates through the level.\n\n3. **Assess the Environment After Moving**: Once the boulder has been pushed, evaluate how this action affects the pathways and hazard dynamics. Look for new routes or barriers that protect against hazards.\n\n4. **Plan Next Steps**: Depending on the arrangement after the boulder is moved, determine the most effective path toward the goal. If the new position allows for a clear route, prepare to move toward that direction.\n\n5. **Explore Additional Interactions**: If pushing the boulder does not create a viable path toward the goal, consider whether other boulders or the box need to be interacted with to further assist in reducing hazards or opening pathways.\n\n### Final Note\nPushing the boulder is a key action to make the environment safer for the avatar. Continuously reassess the state of the game after this interaction, ensuring that the avatar can progress towards the goal securely.\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
