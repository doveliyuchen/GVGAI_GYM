The presence of obstacles (walls, holes) and the interaction of different sprites aligns with characteristics of puzzle challenges.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - The game includes various types of sprites such as walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and an avatar. \n   - Interactions between these sprites dictate gameplay dynamics, such as transforming sprites, bouncing effects, and lethal consequences for the avatar.\n   - Lasers serve as a notable threat to the avatar, with functionality modifying based on the avatar's orientation.\n   \n2. **Movement:**\n   - The avatar can step back from walls and holes, suggesting a focus on careful navigation.\n   - There are mechanics that allow the avatar to bounce off boxes, potentially using these to manipulate the environment.\n\n3. **Game Environment:**\n   - The level layout suggests a complex arrangement of walls and other obstacles that create a defined path or challenge for players to navigate.\n   - The avatar\u2019s objective appears to be reaching the goal while avoiding deadly traps (lasers) and potential hazards (holes).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal of the game is to navigate the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards. Successfully reaching the goal (defined as 'goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5') will yield a score increase, culminating in a win condition.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when the goal sprite is reached, which results in an increase of score (5).\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is depleted (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0) or succumbs to hazards (getting killed by a laser, for instance).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Assess the level layout before initiating movement to anticipate hazards. Use walls for temporary barricades against boulders and lasers when applicable.\n  \n2. **Manipulate Boxes and Boulder Dynamics:**\n   - Utilize boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers or redirect boulders as necessary.\n\n3. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Focus on the orientation of lasers and ensure the avatar engages with them in a frontal direction to avoid instant kills.\n  \n4. **Path Optimization:**\n   - Identify the safest path toward the goal, often by leveraging wall cover and planning contingencies if the avatar needs to change direction swiftly.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Observe the timing and behavior patterns of any moving hazards (if they exist, such as laser cannons) and plan movements accordingly.\n\nBy incorporating these strategic elements, players can navigate the perilous environment successfully and reach the goal, maximizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to fit within the **puzzle-platformer** genre, as it integrates movement mechanics with spatial reasoning and object manipulation. The presence of obstacles (walls, holes) and the interaction of different sprites aligns with characteristics of puzzle challenges.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - The game includes various types of sprites such as walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and an avatar. \n   - Interactions between these sprites dictate gameplay dynamics, such as transforming sprites, bouncing effects, and lethal consequences for the avatar.\n   - Lasers serve as a notable threat to the avatar, with functionality modifying based on the avatar's orientation.\n   \n2. **Movement:**\n   - The avatar can step back from walls and holes, suggesting a focus on careful navigation.\n   - There are mechanics that allow the avatar to bounce off boxes, potentially using these to manipulate the environment.\n\n3. **Game Environment:**\n   - The level layout suggests a complex arrangement of walls and other obstacles that create a defined path or challenge for players to navigate.\n   - The avatar\u2019s objective appears to be reaching the goal while avoiding deadly traps (lasers) and potential hazards (holes).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal of the game is to navigate the avatar to the goal while avoiding hazards. Successfully reaching the goal (defined as 'goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5') will yield a score increase, culminating in a win condition.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when the goal sprite is reached, which results in an increase of score (5).\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is depleted (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0) or succumbs to hazards (getting killed by a laser, for instance).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Assess the level layout before initiating movement to anticipate hazards. Use walls for temporary barricades against boulders and lasers when applicable.\n  \n2. **Manipulate Boxes and Boulder Dynamics:**\n   - Utilize boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers or redirect boulders as necessary.\n\n3. **Laser Avoidance:**\n   - Focus on the orientation of lasers and ensure the avatar engages with them in a frontal direction to avoid instant kills.\n  \n4. **Path Optimization:**\n   - Identify the safest path toward the goal, often by leveraging wall cover and planning contingencies if the avatar needs to change direction swiftly.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Observe the timing and behavior patterns of any moving hazards (if they exist, such as laser cannons) and plan movements accordingly.\n\nBy incorporating these strategic elements, players can navigate the perilous environment successfully and reach the goal, maximizing their score while minimizing risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright lright lright lright lright,lright lright lright lright,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright lright lright lright lright,lright lright lright lright,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nPosition the avatar to push the box into a location that directly shields it from lasers while simultaneously opening a path towards the goal, and be ready to adapt the strategy if the environmental state shifts unexpectedly.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
