The presence of avatar interactions with various objects and the goal of reaching a designated endpoint suggest that it may also contain platforming aspects.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game utilizes different types of sprites, each with unique characteristics:\n  - **Immovable sprites** (ground, wall, hole, goal) serve to create the game environment and define boundaries.\n  - **Passive sprites** (box, boulder, boulderm) can be interacted with but do not inherently affect the game state until manipulated.\n  - **Missiles** (lasers) act as damaging elements that can affect the player based on their orientation.\n  - **OrientedAvatar** represents the player's character, who navigates through the game and interacts with other objects.\n\n- **Interactions**: Various interactions dictate how the avatar and other objects behave. Notably:\n  - Boulders and holes can eliminate the entity (boulderm and avatar).\n  - The avatar can be shielded by boxes from laser attacks.\n  - The goal can be achieved by reaching the designated exit point, which gives a score increment.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the goal (represented by 'g' in the level layout) while avoiding hazards, solving puzzles related to the placement or manipulation of boulders, boxes, and lasers. Reaching the goal grants points and satisfies the win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal ('g') sprite. This is marked by a score increase and will transition the game to a win state.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the 'avatar' sprite count reaches zero, which can happen due to interactions with hazards (such as getting hit by lasers or falling into holes).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: As the avatar, be cautious of lasers that can kill you based on your positioning. Utilize the boxes strategically for protection.\n\n2. **Manipulate Environment**: Use the boulders and boxes to create pathways or obstruct lasers where possible. Trigger interactions to clear paths, particularly where boulders can be moved or holes can eliminate both the boulders and the avatar.\n\n3. **Plan Movement**: Carefully plan each move. The game's grid-like structure means positioning is everything. Ensure you have a clear path to the goal before making your final move.\n\n4. **Careful Use of Shields**: Position your boxes to shield yourself from frontal laser attacks. Considering the game mechanics, this will protect your avatar and allow for safe job transitions through laser-infested areas.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Focus on reaching the goal for maximum score. Be aware that each boulderm or hazard eliminated nets you points, so consider running scenarios where you can rack up smaller points before making a decisive move to the goal.\n\nBy synthesizing these strategies and understanding the game\u2019s mechanics and dynamics, the player can enhance their chances of success in navigating this puzzle-adventure game.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\n************************ -> '@'\n*.***************...@.%* -> '#'\n*..*.**********.@.%....* -> '$'\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%* -> '%'\n*..*......*..........%%* -> '&'\n*..*.....@.....*&......* -> '*'\n*..*....@.@....***.***.* -> 'b'\n*.....................%* -> 'c'\n*...@............*.@..%* -> 'd'\n*@@*...........**...*..* -> 'e'\n*@@*...@.......*&......* -> 'f'\n*a.*......*.........%%$* -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n@\nc\n#\nd\n$\ne\nb\n*\nf\n%\n&\ng\n@\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nBased on the current state of the game and considering the established strategies, here\u2019s a high-level strategy for your next steps:\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n1. **Assess Immediate Threats**: \n   - Evaluate the threats presented by the various laser orientations (denoted by '@') and the hazards (marked as '*'). The goal is to avoid immediate danger while navigating toward the exit.\n\n2. **Utilize Shielding**:\n   - Use the positions of the boxes (represented by '*') as shields against the attacking lasers. Since the avatar can move behind these boxes to avoid damage, ensure your next moves count for protection.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path**:\n   - Identify possible routes toward the goal (\u2018g\u2019) while avoiding the lasers and any hazardous areas. Consider the following path:\n     - Move left to the nearest box to shield against the laser attacks.\n     - Navigate up or down as needed, but always check for laser orientations before proceeding.\n\n4. **Interact with Passive Sprites**:\n   - Look for opportunities to manipulate the passive sprites (boxes and possible movable obstacles) to create additional shielding or modify paths. For instance:\n     - If near a boulderm ('&'), see if it can be moved to create a path.\n     \n5. **Advance Towards the Goal**:\n   - The ultimate target remains to reach the point marked as \u2018g\u2019. Once you've navigated to a safe position behind a box, plan your next couple of moves toward the goal while being cautious of any changes that might occur due to the movement of missiles or other elements.\n\n6. **Maximize Scoring Potential**:\n   - As you make your way to the goal, look for any opportunities to collect points by moving into areas that contain additional passive sprites (for instance, \u2018c\u2019 or other types). Although the primary objective is survival and reaching \u2018g\u2019, maximizing score potential will help enhance overall performance.\n\n7. **Iterate**:\n   - Each time you make a move, reevaluate the environment. The dynamics of the boxes and lasers can shift, so maintain flexibility in your approach and be ready to adapt to new threats or opportunities.\n\n### Specific Next Moves (Example):\n- Move **left to a box** to shield from lasers first, then evaluate:\n  - If you are safe, consider moving **upwards** along the vertical path to navigate further toward the goal.\n  - If faced with complications, redirect downward to find alternate routes and reassess which barriers or shields can be employed next.\n\nUsing these strategies, leverage the environment effectively to advance while minimizing risks, and ensure you successfully navigate to your goal.

Avoid moving into positions where the avatar would be exposed to these hazards. Your first priority is finding safe pathways.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes for Protection**:\n   - Leverage the boxes ('*') to create barriers between the lasers and the avatar. Position the avatar behind a box to shield against approaching laser attacks while planning your next moves.\n\n3. **Plan Your Movement**:\n   - Assess possible movements:\n     - If the avatar can move to a box that provides coverage from lasers while also getting closer to the goal, that should be prioritized.\n     - For example, moving right to the box next to the current position on the grid can provide temporary safety and open paths for future movements.\n\n4. **Evaluate Path Options**:\n   - After obtaining safety behind a box, consider various routes toward the goal ('g'):\n     - Look for paths that involve alternating rows/columns to avoid lasers while still keeping proximity to the exit.\n     - Use boulders ('&') strategically if possible, either to block lasers or to create new pathways that lead toward the exit.\n\n5. **Observe Laser Patterns**:\n   - Monitor the orientation of lasers before committing to a move. Remember that lasers can significantly hinder the avatar\u2019s progress. Calculate movements that avoid future interaction with these hazards.\n\n6. **Consider Scoring Points**:\n   - If moving into an area where passive sprites (like boxes or points items) can increment your scoring seems safe, prioritize that action. Although achieving the goal is necessary, scoring points can help improve overall performance.\n\n7. **Iterate and Adapt**:\n   - After every move, reassess the board state. Changes in your own position or the arrangement of other sprites, including laser orientations, could create new opportunities or threats. Stay flexible.\n\n### Possible Next Moves\n1. **Move Right to Box**:\n   - Move right towards the nearest box to shield from any direct laser attacks coming from the left. This will allow you a safe position to reassess and plan your next move.\n\n2. **Assess the Surrounding Environment**:\n   - Look at the next possible movements\u2014if moving downwards opens additional safe routes while keeping out of range of lasers, consider that.\n\n3. **Prepare for Onward Movement**:\n   - After positioning safely, start thinking ahead about how to navigate past arrays of lasers and boulders. Move according to the safest route adjacent to your current location behind cover.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy\n- As you proceed, continually assess the effectiveness of your positioning against laser threats, pathway obstructions by boulders, and the arrangement of scoring opportunities. Balancing safety with advancing toward the goal will ultimately guide your success in this puzzle-adventure game.

Prioritize ensuring immediate safety before taking any further steps. Avoid moving toward holes or areas without cover unless absolutely necessary.\n\n2. **Identify Nearby Hazards**: \n   - Examine the layout closely\u2014the holes can eliminate your avatar if not navigated carefully. Identify safe places or paths that allow you to maneuver without risking falling into a hole or getting stuck near a wall.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes as Shields**:\n   - If possible, plan to move towards boxes (indicated by `*`). These provide the opportunity to shield the avatar from potential laser attacks and can be used to create pathways if manipulated.\n\n4. **Plan Movement towards the Goal**:\n   - Your main objective is to reach the goal ('g'). Since the current state shows that the goal is located at the bottom near multiple holes, carefully plan your sequences. The safest route involves using the boulders or boxes nearby to create a safe transition.\n\n5. **Strategically Manipulate Boulders**:\n   - Boulders ('&') can be used to block paths or create alternative routes. If there's an opportunity to push them for cover or create a path to the goal, consider doing so.\n   - Given the structure, check if moving toward a boulder could provide an escape route or help to shield from falling hazards.\n\n6. **Iterate and Adjust**:\n   - After each move, evaluate your position continuously. Keep an eye on your surroundings, particularly the orientation of any hazards. Make adjustments as necessary based on new opportunities or threats that emerge with each move.\n\n### Possible Moves\n1. **Move Right to Box**:\n   - Select the box (`*`) on the right if available, as it can protect you from any vertical danger while you reassess your next steps. Once there, you can consider moving further right or down if there are safe spots.\n\n2. **Evaluate Downward Movement Options**:\n   - You could potentially move down to the next row if boxes are not obstructing your way, effectively creating more options for safe placement away from holes.\n\n3. **Future Path Planning**:\n   - As you evaluate the immediate area, identify potential routes toward the goal. If you can reach boxes or boulders to use as barriers or guide routes, that would be ideal.\n\n### Long-Term Considerations\n- Always consider keeping the avatar hidden behind obstacles whenever possible to maximize safety against hazards, particularly those that may cause elimination.\n- Each move should contribute toward getting closer to the goal while ensuring the avatar is not put in a vulnerable position against lasers, holes, or other threats. Balancing safety with progress is crucial.\n\nBy following these strategies and staying adaptable to the evolving game dynamics, you will increase your chances of successfully navigating toward the goal while avoiding hazards.

The focus will be on safely navigating the avatar toward the goal while avoiding hazards and utilizing the environment effectively.\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps\n\n1. **Assess the Immediate Environment**:\n   - The avatar is currently surrounded by walls and holes while facing potential threats from missiles (lasers). The presence of holes below and walls around necessitates careful consideration of movement options.\n\n2. **Avoid Immediate Hazards**:\n   - Since holes can eliminate the avatar, prioritize movements that prevent the avatar from falling into them. The area surrounding the avatar should be surveyed for safe paths that avoid these hazards.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**:\n   - The boxes (`*`) present a strategic opportunity to shield the avatar from laser attacks. Move towards the box to use it as protection while plotting your next move.\n   - Engaging with boulders (`&`) could be beneficial; manipulating them may pave a safer path or block hazards.\n\n4. **Plan Safe Movements**:\n   - Given the avatar's potential moves are limited by walls and hazards, consider planning a multi-step sequence that takes into account safe positioning. Evaluate potential moves methodically.\n   - For the current turn, move **right into the box (`*`)** to gain immediate protection from numerically aligned laser threats while doing nothing at the current turns.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Route toward the Goal**:\n   - After the avatar moves to the box, assess the next available moves. Moving down or around the boulders, behind the cover of boxes, and closely navigating along the edges of hazards should be considered.\n   - The next immediate goal after reaching the box is to find a path through which you can navigate past any holes and reach the goal without encountering hazards directly.\n\n6. **Iteration and Adaptation**:\n   - After each move, reassess for changes in the game state. Depending on subsequent movements, new opportunities or dangers may emerge, requiring adaptive strategies.\n   - Always aim to be behind a box or some barrier that can block laser attacks wherever possible.\n\n### Proposed Immediate Moves:\n- **Move Right**: Move into the adjacent box (`*`). This grants immediate protection against any potential future laser threats while keeping options open for subsequent movements. \n\n### Long-Term Considerations:\n- **Pathway Planning**: After securing safety behind the box, start considering a pathway towards the direction of the goal (`g`). You would need to navigate around the obstacles and determine if boulders can be pushed to create safer routes.\n  \n- **Combine Offensive and Defensive Strategies**: As the player progresses, utilize both the boxes and boulders for shielding while gradually making your way toward the goal.\n\nBy following this step-wise approach and continuously assessing the environment, the avatar can navigate efficiently while minimizing the risk from hazards. This strategic thinking is essential for solving the challenges posed by the game effectively.
