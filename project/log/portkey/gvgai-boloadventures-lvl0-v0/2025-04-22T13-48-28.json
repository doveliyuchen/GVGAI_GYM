    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThe game appears to belong to the puzzle and physics-based genre. Players must navigate through a grid-like layout using objects, avoiding threats, and interacting with various elements to solve puzzles and achieve goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game uses distinct sprites for different elements, including ground, walls, holes, goals, the avatar (the player's character), boxes, boulders, and lasers. \n- **Interactions:** Various interactions dictate how the avatar and objects behave when they come into contact:\n  - The avatar can bounce off walls, push boxes, and interact with lasers in a way that is fatal if not careful.\n  - Boulders can transform into moving versions (boulderm) and can kill the avatar when they interact, suggesting that they are dangerous.\n  - The player can use boxes as shields against frontal laser attacks.\n- **Goal and Scoring:** The primary goal is to move the avatar to the 'goal' sprite to score points (5 points) and lead to victory. The player can also earn points by destroying holes with boulders which yields 1 point for both sprites involved.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The objective is to reach the 'goal' while managing interactions with other objects and avoiding death through various hazards (falling into holes, getting hit by lasers, or being crushed by boulders).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Achieving the objective of moving the avatar to the 'goal' sprite changes the game state to win.\n- **Loss Condition:** If the avatar sprite is eliminated or reduced to zero remaining sprites, the game concludes with a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Players should familiarize themselves with the level layout and recognize patterns or traps that might exist between hazards (lasers, boulders, and walls).\n\n2. **Object Utilization:** \n   - Use boxes to shield against frontal laser attacks and to push other objects when necessary.\n   - Manage the placement of boulders and boxes to control movement in the level. Be cautious as pushing a boulder can cause it to transform into its more dangerous form.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** \n   - Stay aware of the laser cannon positions. Ensure to navigate around lasers as they can kill the avatar both from the front and rear.\n   - Keep a safe distance from boulders, and have a strategy in place if one begins to roll towards the avatar.\n\n4. **Efficient Path Planning:**\n   - Plan the route to the goal in such a way to minimize unnecessary interactions with hazards.\n   - Attempt to set up moves that can lead to clearing the holes (and potentially scoring points) at the same time as progressing toward the goal.\n\n5. **Experimentation and Adaptation:**\n   - If a strategy fails, be prepared to rethink the approach\u2014test the interactions (like using boulders to activate holes) before attempting full paths to avoid sudden defeat.\n\nBy being cautious, utilizing objects effectively, and planning moves strategically, players can improve their chances of successfully reaching the goal while navigating the hazards of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'h'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 11, col = 2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**Interact with the item `@` to uncover its effects and utilize any advantages it may provide for progressing toward the goal.**\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
