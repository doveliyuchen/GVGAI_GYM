The presence of various immovable and movable sprites, interactions between them, and the objective of reaching a goal suggest a focus on strategic movement and problem-solving within a platforming context.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game includes multiple types of sprites: immovable objects (walls, ground, goal), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers).\n2. **Avatar**:\n   - The player controls an avatar that must navigate around obstacles and interact with the sprites to achieve the objectives.\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - Various interactions can occur between the avatar and the sprites, such as bouncing off boxes, being attracted by boulders, and stepping back when colliding with walls or lasers.\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar upon contact, indicating a need for careful navigation.\n4. **Scoring**:\n   - Points can be scored (1 point for killing both the boulderm and a hole), and a higher score (5 points) is awarded for reaching the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The goal serves as the endpoint of each level or session, and the player earns points upon reaching it.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which results in a score increase of 5 points. The game ends if the sprite counter for the goal reaches 0.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, indicating that the avatar has been eliminated (probably by a laser or through some other means).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: The lasers pose a significant threat to the avatar. Players should effectively navigate around them and avoid direct contact.\n2. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boxes as shields against laser fire, allowing the avatar to safely maneuver through areas that may be otherwise hazardous.\n3. **Plan Moves Carefully**: Since certain interactions cause the avatar to step back or transform states (like turning into a boulderm), players should think several moves ahead to avoid backtracking unnecessarily or ending up in lethal situations.\n4. **Collect Points**: Look for opportunities to interact with elements in the environment that can yield additional scores, such as the interaction between boulderm and hole.\n5. **Reach the Goal**: Prioritize navigating through the level towards the goal while maintaining a balance of evading enemies and obstacles. Use the layout to your advantage, such as leveraging walls and boxes for strategic movement.\n\n### Level Layout Insights\nThe level design appears to include a variety of pathways leading to the goal (represented by a \"0\"). The player will need to navigate a complex mixture of walls, obstacles, and potential hazards represented as barriers and enemies (lasers). A strategic approach would involve:\n\n- Identifying safe paths to move toward the goal.\n- Using boxes to shield from laser attacks while enabling lateral movement.\n- Observing the positions and movements of boulders to determine optimal interactions.\n\nWith careful planning and navigation, reaching the goal while maximizing score potential is achievable.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Puzzle-Platformer Game\n\n#### Current Objective:\nNavigate the avatar (denoted as '@') toward the goal (denoted as '$') while avoiding hazards (e.g., walls and lasers), effectively utilizing the surrounding sprites (e.g., boulders, boxes) to enhance movement options and maximize scoring opportunities.\n\n### Breakdown of Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Current Position**:\n   The avatar is at `(10, 9)` surrounded by walls with two holes at `(10, 11)` and `(11, 11)` to the right side. The goal is located directly below at `(11, 13)` with the path leading from the left blocked by walls.\n\n2. **Immediate Actions**:\n   - **Identify Safe Paths**: The only immediate movement for the avatar is to go down, as left and right are blocked by walls.\n   - **Move Downwards**: From `(10, 9)` to `(11, 9)` to clear the wall barrier and identify new movement opportunities.\n\n3. **Evaluate Future Moves**:\n   - The next immediate strategy involves moving left or downwards towards the path leading to the goal.\n   - After moving to `(11, 9)`, the avatar can only continue to `(12, 9)` due to walls above and below.\n\n4. **Utilize Box and Boulder**:\n   - At the position `(12, 9)`, assess surroundings:\n     - There are boulders at `(12, 8)` and `(13, 8)` that can be utilized to shield against any lethal sprites.\n     - Look for opportunities to invoke interactions between the boulders and holes which may yield additional points.\n\n5. **Plan Goal Approach**:\n   - After reaching `(12, 9)`, aim to navigate toward either:\n     - Left to `(12, 8)` to position near boulders to shield against dangers while looking for possible interactions.\n     - Downward movement to lead towards the goal directly.\n\n6. **Considering Scoring**:\n   - Attempt to interact with boulders and holes in a way that earns bonus points while advancing:\n     - For each boulderm-holes interaction, consider how to manipulate the boulders into holes for potential score enhancement.\n\n7. **Route to Goal**:\n   - Aim to traverse from `(11, 9)` down towards `(11, 13)` while utilizing either interactions or walls for blockade against any possible hazards.\n\n### Final Note\n- Maintaining awareness of the surroundings, especially hazards like lasers or obstacles that might obstruct the path to the goal, is crucial for survival and scoring.\n- Continuous evaluation of potential moves after each action taken will optimize the route to the goal.\n  \nBy systematically progressing and utilizing interactions wisely, the avatar should reach the goal efficiently while maximizing the score.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

Below the avatar, there's a clear space leading down towards the goal at `(11, 13)`.\n\n2. **Immediate Moves**:\n   - The first logical move is to move **downward** to `(11, 9)`. This immediately opens up opportunities for further movement since walls will not obstruct direct paths.\n\n3. **Evaluate Surroundings After Move**:\n   - After moving to `(11, 9)`, check the next possible moves. The immediate options available from `(11, 9)` are:\n     - Left to `(11, 8)`: blocked by walls.\n     - Down to `(12, 9)`: open.\n     - Up to `(10, 9)`: bringing the avatar back.\n   - Given these options, the next priority is to **move down to `(12, 9)`**.\n\n4. **Continue Towards Goal**:\n   - From `(12, 9)`, the avatar should continue navigating downward and resolve potential points for interaction with boulders and holes:\n     - Moving to `(13, 9)` leads directly to a possible left/right maneuver around boulders located at `(12, 8)` and `(13, 8)`.\n     - Here, assess if manipulating boulders and interacting with any holes available on the level can grant additional points.\n\n5. **Interaction with Environment**:\n   - Once reaching or nearing critical boulders (specifically the ones at `(12, 8)` and `(13, 8)`), consider the following strategies:\n     - If a boulder can be placed/rolled into a hole at `(12, 8)`, it can yield scoring of 1 point.\n     - Ensure any movement does not position the avatar too close to threats (like lasers) or lead to a dead end.\n\n6. **Final Stretch to Goal**:\n   - After manipulating boulders and maximizing environmental points, aim the avatar towards moving to the goal located further down at `(11, 13)`.\n   - Make tactical moves considering the final barriers and ensure to leap across any final dangers like lasers.\n\n7. **Maintain Awareness of Hazards**:\n   - Ensure not to lose track of the movement of adjacent hazards like lasers which can potentially threaten the avatar.\n   - Utilize walls and boxes as obstruction to protect against any directional fire when maneuvering around.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Careful Planning**: Since some movements will potentially thrust the avatar into hazardous zones, planned navigation must take the hazards into account effectively.\n- **Scoring Potential**: Always consider earning points where possible and strategically assess if risks are worth potential gains.\n- **Iterative Evaluation**: After each movement, always evaluate the new position and assess subsequent options.\n\nBy executing these strategies thoughtfully while surveying the surroundings, the avatar will have a structured path to navigating toward the goal while maximizing point opportunities effectively.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

This opens up the next clear path for additional movement as there are options to move further down or manipulate surroundings.\n\n3. **Evaluate New Position**:\n   - After moving to `(11, 9)`, the avatar has the following movement options:\n     - Down to `(12, 9)`: open.\n     - Up to `(10, 9)`: brings it back.\n   - Move **down** again to `(12, 9)`, as this avoids wall traps and continues progressing towards the goal.\n\n4. **Next Possible Moves**:\n   - From `(12, 9)`:\n     - Evaluating the path down to `(13, 9)`, where potential boulders and pathways to the goal can be navigated.\n     - Consider moving **down** to `(13, 9)` to further explore the environment without obstruction.\n\n5. **Collecting Points**:\n   - After reaching `(13, 9)`, look for opportunities to interact with boulders located above or to the sides:\n     - Utilize boulders and any nearby holes that could yield a point for interaction.\n     - Check for any laser placements that may affect upcoming moves.\n\n6. **Final Approach to Goal**:\n   - The avatar will seek to navigate to goal position `(11, 13)` after setting up boulders for interaction, ensuring to avoid lasers, if present.\n   - If there are open positions or if the boulders can be manipulated into holes, execute these moves first to maximize scoring.\n\n7. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Throughout the navigation, continuously assess the surroundings to avoid hazards:\n     - Manage the potential danger of lasers and any traps, adapting movements accordingly to ensure safe passage.\n\n### Summary of Moves\n1. Move **down** from `(10, 9)` to `(11, 9)`.\n2. Move **down** again to `(12, 9)`.\n3. Move **down** to `(13, 9)` to open further pathways towards the goal.\n4. Engage stability with boulders and holes, maximizing scoring options.\n5. Finally, navigate toward the goal at `(11, 13)` carefully!\n\n### Final Considerations\n- Maintain acute awareness of wall patterns and position throughout the next moves to ensure clarity in movement.\n- Points should become a driving force, especially when planning interactions, so always aim for opportunities to accrue additional scoring.\n\nBy executing these strategies carefully, the avatar can safeguard against hazards while progressing efficiently toward the goal.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

There are walls surrounding the avatar on the left and right, with the ability to move down to `(11, 9)`, which is a clear path forward.\n\n2. **Immediate Moves**:\n   - **Move Down**:\n     - Move from `(10, 9)` to **down to `(11, 9)`**. This step opens up further movement options without retracing steps.\n\n3. **Evaluate Next Position**:\n   - Upon reaching `(11, 9)`, the options are:\n     - Down to `(12, 9)`: this cell is clear.\n     - Up to `(10, 9)`: which would bring the avatar back.\n   - **Move Down again** to `(12, 9)`, as this will continue to advance toward the goal.\n\n4. **Continue Downward Progress**:\n   - Now at `(12, 9)`, the next considerations are:\n     - The option to move down to `(13, 9)` is available.\n     - Moving down to `(13, 9)` keeps options open further towards the goal.\n\n5. **Investigate Boulder Interactions**:\n   - Upon reaching `(13, 9)`, examine the surrounding boulders:\n     - One notable interaction could be at `(12, 8)` and `(12, 7)`. Engaging with a boulder here could set up scoring opportunities later on.\n   - Engage with any boulders by moving to an adjacent square or nudging a boulder into a hole if possible, which can yield points.\n\n6. **Final Positions to the Goal**:\n   - After navigating through the boulders or manipulating them for scores:\n     - Aim to reach the goal located at `(12, 13)`.\n     - Moving up or around to bypass any lasers or walls directly below the goal is essential.\n\n7. **Maintain Vigilance Against Hazards**:\n   - Carefully observe surrounding areas for any potential laser traps; ensuring any moves maintain a safe distance.\n\n### Move Summary\n1. **Down** to `(11, 9)`.\n2. **Down** again to `(12, 9)`.\n3. **Down** to `(13, 9)`.\n4. Engage with boulders or strategically prepare for goal approach.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- Manage to keep a balance between advancing towards the goal and scoring via interactions with boulders.\n- Do not forget to continuously assess paths; the movement and re-evaluation are crucial to avoid hazard interactions.\n\nBy implementing this structured plan thoughtfully, the avatar can make consistent progress toward the goal while maximizing scoring opportunities and ensuring survival against hazards.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the description of the rules, sprites, interactions, and layout, this game appears to be a puzzle-platformer. The presence of various immovable and movable sprites, interactions between them, and the objective of reaching a goal suggest a focus on strategic movement and problem-solving within a platforming context.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game includes multiple types of sprites: immovable objects (walls, ground, goal), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers).\n2. **Avatar**:\n   - The player controls an avatar that must navigate around obstacles and interact with the sprites to achieve the objectives.\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - Various interactions can occur between the avatar and the sprites, such as bouncing off boxes, being attracted by boulders, and stepping back when colliding with walls or lasers.\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar upon contact, indicating a need for careful navigation.\n4. **Scoring**:\n   - Points can be scored (1 point for killing both the boulderm and a hole), and a higher score (5 points) is awarded for reaching the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The goal serves as the endpoint of each level or session, and the player earns points upon reaching it.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which results in a score increase of 5 points. The game ends if the sprite counter for the goal reaches 0.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, indicating that the avatar has been eliminated (probably by a laser or through some other means).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: The lasers pose a significant threat to the avatar. Players should effectively navigate around them and avoid direct contact.\n2. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boxes as shields against laser fire, allowing the avatar to safely maneuver through areas that may be otherwise hazardous.\n3. **Plan Moves Carefully**: Since certain interactions cause the avatar to step back or transform states (like turning into a boulderm), players should think several moves ahead to avoid backtracking unnecessarily or ending up in lethal situations.\n4. **Collect Points**: Look for opportunities to interact with elements in the environment that can yield additional scores, such as the interaction between boulderm and hole.\n5. **Reach the Goal**: Prioritize navigating through the level towards the goal while maintaining a balance of evading enemies and obstacles. Use the layout to your advantage, such as leveraging walls and boxes for strategic movement.\n\n### Level Layout Insights\nThe level design appears to include a variety of pathways leading to the goal (represented by a \"0\"). The player will need to navigate a complex mixture of walls, obstacles, and potential hazards represented as barriers and enemies (lasers). A strategic approach would involve:\n\n- Identifying safe paths to move toward the goal.\n- Using boxes to shield from laser attacks while enabling lateral movement.\n- Observing the positions and movements of boulders to determine optimal interactions.\n\nWith careful planning and navigation, reaching the goal while maximizing score potential is achievable.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

This allows movement towards the goal while ensuring safe passage.\n\n2. **Evaluate Position After Move**:\n   - At `(11, 9)`, next possible moves are:\n     - **Down to `(12, 9)`**: Clear path.\n     - **Up to `(10, 9)`**: Backtracking to previous position.\n   - Therefore, the next logical move is to **move down to `(12, 9)`.**\n\n3. **Continue Downward Progress**: \n   - From `(12, 9)`, assess further options:\n     - **Down to `(13, 9)`**: Open.\n     - Manipulating nearby boulders on this level could yield additional scoring.\n\n4. **Interact with Environment**:\n   - If the next position includes nearby boulders, engaging them will yield points or help manipulate the environment effectively.\n   - If the avatar is able to push or roll a boulder into a hole, this will score 1 point per interaction.\n\n5. **Final Path to Goal**:\n   - Upon successfully maneuvering around boulders and managing to collect points, the avatar can now aim for the goal at `(12, 13)`:\n     - Path from `(12, 9)` to `(12, 13)` should remain direct if no barriers are in the way.\n     - Ensure navigate around potential obstacles confidently.\n\n6. **Avoid Hazards**: \n   - Stay alert for wall interactions and avoid any lasers.\n   - If there are any other obstacles or dangers along the route to `(12, 13)`, strategize around them to ensure safe navigation.\n\n### Summary of Moves:\n1. **Move Down** to `(11, 9)`.\n2. **Move Down** to `(12, 9)`.\n3. **Move Down** to `(13, 9)` to explore further boulders and score opportunities.\n4. Focusably engage with boulders or interact with holes for additional scoring.\n5. Aim directly for the goal. Move towards `(12, 13)`.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- Continuous awareness of any traps or hazards, particularly laser positions, is critical in maintaining health.\n- The interactions with the environment can enhance the score and facilitate reaching the goal more efficiently.\n\nExecuting this plan with careful attention to detail and consistent navigation will help achieve the objective of reaching the goal while maximizing point collection opportunities.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

The presence of various immovable and movable sprites, interactions between them, and the objective of reaching a goal suggest a focus on strategic movement and problem-solving within a platforming context.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game includes multiple types of sprites: immovable objects (walls, ground, goal), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers).\n2. **Avatar**:\n   - The player controls an avatar that must navigate around obstacles and interact with the sprites to achieve the objectives.\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - Various interactions can occur between the avatar and the sprites, such as bouncing off boxes, being attracted by boulders, and stepping back when colliding with walls or lasers.\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar upon contact, indicating a need for careful navigation.\n4. **Scoring**:\n   - Points can be scored (1 point for killing both the boulderm and a hole), and a higher score (5 points) is awarded for reaching the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The goal serves as the endpoint of each level or session, and the player earns points upon reaching it.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which results in a score increase of 5 points. The game ends if the sprite counter for the goal reaches 0.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, indicating that the avatar has been eliminated (probably by a laser or through some other means).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: The lasers pose a significant threat to the avatar. Players should effectively navigate around them and avoid direct contact.\n2. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boxes as shields against laser fire, allowing the avatar to safely maneuver through areas that may be otherwise hazardous.\n3. **Plan Moves Carefully**: Since certain interactions cause the avatar to step back or transform states (like turning into a boulderm), players should think several moves ahead to avoid backtracking unnecessarily or ending up in lethal situations.\n4. **Collect Points**: Look for opportunities to interact with elements in the environment that can yield additional scores, such as the interaction between boulderm and hole.\n5. **Reach the Goal**: Prioritize navigating through the level towards the goal while maintaining a balance of evading enemies and obstacles. Use the layout to your advantage, such as leveraging walls and boxes for strategic movement.\n\n### Level Layout Insights\nThe level design appears to include a variety of pathways leading to the goal (represented by a \"0\"). The player will need to navigate a complex mixture of walls, obstacles, and potential hazards represented as barriers and enemies (lasers). A strategic approach would involve:\n\n- Identifying safe paths to move toward the goal.\n- Using boxes to shield from laser attacks while enabling lateral movement.\n- Observing the positions and movements of boulders to determine optimal interactions.\n\nWith careful planning and navigation, reaching the goal while maximizing score potential is achievable.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

This would keep moving toward the goal.\n\n2. **Evaluate New Position at `(11, 9)`**:\n   - After moving down to `(11, 9)`, evaluate the surroundings:\n     - Up to `(10, 9)`: Backtracking.\n     - Down to `(12, 9)`: Clear path and keeps progressing toward the goal.\n     - Left to `(11, 8)`: Clear path but may lead away from the goal.\n     - Right to `(11, 10)`: Blocked by wall.\n   - **Next Move**: Move **down to `(12, 9)`.**\n\n3. **Continue the Journey at `(12, 9)`**:\n   - At `(12, 9)`, assess options:\n     - Up to `(11, 9)`: Backtracking.\n     - Down to `(13, 9)`: Clear path.\n     - Left to `(12, 8)`: Clear path, but this may not lead toward the goal.\n     - Right to `(12, 10)`: Clear path and progresses toward the goal.\n   - **Next Move**: Move **right to `(12, 10)`**.\n\n4. **Approach the Goal**:\n   - Now at `(12, 10)`, evaluate available moves:\n     - Up to `(11, 10)`: Blocked by wall.\n     - Down to `(13, 10)`: Clear path.\n     - Left to `(12, 9)`: Backtrack.\n     - Right to `(12, 11)`: Clear path and takes you directly closer to the goal.\n   - **Next Move**: Move **right to `(12, 11)`**.\n\n5. **Final Move to the Goal**:\n   - Now at `(12, 11)`, assess the final move options:\n     - Up to `(11, 11)`: Blocked.\n     - Down to `(13, 11)`: Clear path.\n     - Left to `(12, 10)`: Backtrack.\n     - Right to `(12, 12)`: This is potentially the goal area located at `(12, 13)`.\n   - **Final Move**: Move **right to `(12, 12)`**, heading directly towards the goal at `(12, 13)`.\n\n### Move Summary:\n1. **Move Down** to `(11, 9)`.\n2. **Move Down** to `(12, 9)`.\n3. **Move Right** to `(12, 10)`.\n4. **Move Right** to `(12, 11)`.\n5. **Move Right** to the **goal at `(12, 12)`**.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Avoid Backtracking**: Aim for moves that maintain progression towards the goal without unnecessary detours.\n- **Maximize Scoring**: Throughout your journey, look for scoring opportunities with boulders and holes. Engage the environment when possible.\n- **Hazard Awareness**: Continuously check for nearby hazards like lasers to ensure safe movement while progressing.\n\nThis methodical approach will help the avatar navigate through the level efficiently, achieving the goal while minimizing risks with careful navigation.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the description of the rules, sprites, interactions, and layout, this game appears to be a puzzle-platformer. The presence of various immovable and movable sprites, interactions between them, and the objective of reaching a goal suggest a focus on strategic movement and problem-solving within a platforming context.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game includes multiple types of sprites: immovable objects (walls, ground, goal), passive objects (boxes, boulders), and missiles (lasers).\n2. **Avatar**:\n   - The player controls an avatar that must navigate around obstacles and interact with the sprites to achieve the objectives.\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - Various interactions can occur between the avatar and the sprites, such as bouncing off boxes, being attracted by boulders, and stepping back when colliding with walls or lasers.\n   - Lasers can kill the avatar upon contact, indicating a need for careful navigation.\n4. **Scoring**:\n   - Points can be scored (1 point for killing both the boulderm and a hole), and a higher score (5 points) is awarded for reaching the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The goal serves as the endpoint of each level or session, and the player earns points upon reaching it.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, which results in a score increase of 5 points. The game ends if the sprite counter for the goal reaches 0.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0, indicating that the avatar has been eliminated (probably by a laser or through some other means).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: The lasers pose a significant threat to the avatar. Players should effectively navigate around them and avoid direct contact.\n2. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boxes as shields against laser fire, allowing the avatar to safely maneuver through areas that may be otherwise hazardous.\n3. **Plan Moves Carefully**: Since certain interactions cause the avatar to step back or transform states (like turning into a boulderm), players should think several moves ahead to avoid backtracking unnecessarily or ending up in lethal situations.\n4. **Collect Points**: Look for opportunities to interact with elements in the environment that can yield additional scores, such as the interaction between boulderm and hole.\n5. **Reach the Goal**: Prioritize navigating through the level towards the goal while maintaining a balance of evading enemies and obstacles. Use the layout to your advantage, such as leveraging walls and boxes for strategic movement.\n\n### Level Layout Insights\nThe level design appears to include a variety of pathways leading to the goal (represented by a \"0\"). The player will need to navigate a complex mixture of walls, obstacles, and potential hazards represented as barriers and enemies (lasers). A strategic approach would involve:\n\n- Identifying safe paths to move toward the goal.\n- Using boxes to shield from laser attacks while enabling lateral movement.\n- Observing the positions and movements of boulders to determine optimal interactions.\n\nWith careful planning and navigation, reaching the goal while maximizing score potential is achievable.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb.....................%b\nb.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...@.%b\nb...@............b.@..%b\nb..b.bbbbbbbbbb.@.%....b\nb@@b...........bb...b..b\nb..b....@.@....bbb.bbb.b\nb..b.....@.....b&*.....b\nb@@b...@.......b&*.....b\nb..b...#..b%%%%...@...%b\nb..b......b..........%%b\nba.b......b.........%%$b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bb....*\n*@@*...@.......*&bb....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is increasing y, Down is decreasing y)\n(y=1, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Step in Puzzle-Platformer Game\n\n#### Current Objective:\nThe avatar (denoted as '@') is currently located at `(10, 9)` and needs to navigate to the goal (denoted as '$') which is positioned at `(12, 13)`.
