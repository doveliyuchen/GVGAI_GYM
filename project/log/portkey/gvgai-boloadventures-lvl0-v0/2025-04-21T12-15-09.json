The use of sprites and interactions suggests a game where players manipulate objects and navigate through a labyrinthine environment to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: There are various sprites with different behaviors:\n  - **Ground, Holes, Goals**: These are immovable objects indicating areas the player can navigate, obstacles, and the win condition.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character, which exhibits characteristics of an oriented avatar meaning it can face different directions and interact with other sprites based on orientation.\n  - **Boxes and Boulder**: These are passive objects that can be moved or obstructed.\n  - **Laser Cannons**: Functioning as triggers that can shoot lasers are lethal to the avatar, emphasizing strategic positioning and timing.\n  \n- **Interactions**: The specific interactions define how sprites interact with one another. For example:\n  - The avatar can be killed by lasers based on orientation, highlighting a strategic element in maneuvering and avoiding lethal traps.\n  - The relationships between boulders, blocks, and the avatar indicate a puzzle-solving aspect where you must manipulate these sprites to navigate the level safely.\n  \n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to guide the avatar to the goal (represented by the sprite 'goal') while solving puzzles, avoiding hazards (lasers, holes), and interacting with elements (boxes and boulders) to progress through the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the 'goal' sprite, resulting in a score increase (scoreChange=5).\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  1. If the avatar is killed (by hitting lasers from non-frontal angles or by being pushed into holes or walls).\n  2. If the count of the sprite avatar reaches zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Careful Navigation**: Move the avatar strategically, always being aware of the laser direction and the hazards present in the environment. Ensure that the avatar is never facing lasers directly unless it is the only safe move.\n  \n2. **Manipulate Environment**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser shots, and use boulders to manipulate the pathways or potentially trap hazards.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before moving the avatar, assess the surrounding environment for potential pitfalls (like holes or areas with boulders). Ensure that each move does not place the avatar in a position where it can be cornered or trapped by moving lasers or other hazards.\n\n4. **Utilize Obstacles**: Consider how to use boxes and boulders as strategic barriers when engaging with laser cannons or when needing to pass through tight areas (i.e., maneuvering around clustered sprites).\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Focus on reaching the goal without unnecessary distractions, emphasizing the score change mechanism for optimizing level completion.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the puzzle nature of the game, some levels may require experimentation to learn the interactions of various components and find the most efficient path to the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, solve the puzzles within, and achieve their objectives while mitigating the risks presented by the game's mechanics.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The immediate surrounding is traversable, but there are multiple items the avatar can interact with, primarily the boxes and the holes around it. The nearest interactable items are the boulders located at (2, 3), (5, 4), and (4, 6) which may allow us to manipulate or block hazards.\n\n### Key Observations\n- The goal is located at coordinate (11, 9), which is the ultimate target.\n- There are multiple hazards (holes, lasers) that require careful navigation.\n- The boulders can be moved (as per usual puzzle mechanics), and the avatar can also reorient itself toward interacting with the boxes or boulders.\n  \n### Strategic Approach:\n1. **Identify the Need**: With the avatar's current location and the proximity of the goal, the priority is to clear a safer path towards the goal while avoiding hazards.\n  \n2. **Utilize Nearest Interactables**: The boulders offer great strategic positioning to either block laser paths or clear other elements. Moving one of the boulders may open a safer route.\n  \n3. **Remain Cautious of Hazards**: Given the presence of multiple hazards such as holes and potentially lethal orientations due to laser cannons, it\u2019s imperative that every move should enhance safety first and foremost.\n\n4. **Plan Next Move**: The next actionable item is to move the boulder at position (4, 5) into a position (4, 6) that will facilitate a passage toward the right without directly facing any potential lasers.\n\nBy carrying out this maneuver, the avatar can open up the route towards the goal while maintaining a safe distance from immediate danger.\n\n```**Move the boulder at (4, 5) to (4, 6) to create a potential safer pathway towards the goal at (11, 9).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate surroundings indicate that the path can be maneuvered to avoid potential hazards. The closest interactable items include multiple boulders and boxes. \n\n### Key Observations\n- The goal is at (11, 9), directly below the avatar's position, which suggests a need to clear or manipulate obstacles to allow movement toward it safely.\n- The surrounding items include several boulders (e.g., at (6, 2), (7, 4), etc.) and boxes that can be moved to facilitate progression.\n- There are also areas filled with holes that pose a significant risk if the avatar inadvertently moves into them, particularly if it is pushed into them by another item.\n\n### Strategic Approach:\n1. **Identify the Need**: The immediate goal is to create a clear pathway down to the row where the goal is located, while avoiding hazards posed by holes.\n   \n2. **Utilize the Nearest Boulder**: The nearest boulder to manipulate is at (6, 2). By moving the boulder to (6, 3), it may enable additional pathways or block undesirable paths.\n\n3. **Stay Vigilant**: Being cautious of potential hazards from holes while positioning the boulder will also be critical. This movement should aim to maximize safety and maintain access to lower rows.\n\n4. **Plan for Continuity**: Once the first boulder is moved, observe the layout carefully for any subsequent maneuvers or interactions with other objects (like boxes).\n\nBased on this analysis, it is now strategic to focus on manipulating the boulder.\n\n```**Move the boulder at (6, 2) to (6, 3) to begin creating a safer pathway towards the goal at (11, 9).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Observing the immediate surroundings, it can move toward several boulders and walls while navigating the field safely. The goal is located down at (11, 9). \n\n### Key Observations\n- The most immediate row of interest features a series of walls, making navigating directly downwards risky, as there are hazards (specifically holes and potentially laser traps) below.\n- The avatar can move left (to (10, 1)) or right (to (12, 1)) since both surrounding columns are clear. \n- The boulder at (9, 2) could potentially help in blocking hazards or forming a strategic barrier against any hazards if the avatar chooses to interact with it.\n\n### Strategic Approach:\n1. **Identify Potential Moves**: Given the hazards on the immediate path to the goal, moving to (10, 1) may provide a clearer view of the available options below.\n  \n2. **Use Nearest Boulder**: The nearest interactable object is the boulder at (9, 2). Interacting with this boulder may help secure a safer pathway or block potential traps below.\n\n3. **Prioritize Safety**: Before making any moves, it\u2019s essential to evaluate the positions of hazards. Ensure that any movement doesn\u2019t put the avatar in direct line with lasers or into holes.\n\n4. **Plan for Progress**: The next movement should facilitate not only immediate safety but also a more straightforward approach towards the goal, minimizing unnecessary conflicts with obstacles.\n\n### Next Steps\nMoving the avatar left to (10, 1) gives it better access to explore further options while avoiding immediate hazards.\n\n```**Move the avatar from (11, 1) to (10, 1) to explore options for interacting with the boulder at (9, 2) and facilitate a safer pathway toward the goal at (11, 9).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Surrounding this position, the avatar has access to a variety of pathways thanks to the open spaces around it while being careful about hazards like holes. The goal is located further below at (11, 9).\n\n### Key Observations\n- The immediate surroundings include various boulders and blocks that can be interacted with. \n- Multiple boulders are present directly below the avatar's position, providing opportunities for manipulation.\n- The wall and the funnel from (10, 0) to (10, 2) provides limited routes but also offers some structural support, preventing direct access to hazards, including holes.\n- Notably, the boxes positioned might block or shield the way forward to interactable spaces further down where the goal lies.\n\n### Strategic Approach:\n1. **Evaluate Possible Moves**: The avatar should focus on moving downwards, with the intent to later maneuver leftward to progress towards the goal.\n  \n2. **Use Nearest Boulders**: The boulders at (9, 1) and (10, 2) are the nearest interactable elements. Interacting with the boulder at (10, 2) to safely reposition it could secure a safer passage by clearing holes below.\n\n3. **Focus on Safety**: Ensuring that the path remains clear from hazards is paramount. Any interaction must consider the potential risk of pushing items into holes.\n\n4. **Plan for Next Steps**: The next move should create safe routes for further progress toward the goal at (11, 9), giving enough space for additional maneuvers in subsequent turns.\n\nMoving the boulder at (10, 2) downward would help establish a clearer route toward the goal by potentially creating space below.\n\n### Next Steps\nInteracting with the boulder will help facilitate safe movement toward the goal, exposing the avatar to advantageous positioning.\n\n```**Move the boulder at (10, 2) downwards to (10, 3) to create a safer path toward the goal at (11, 9) while avoiding hazards.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

If the avatar is killed (by hitting lasers from non-frontal angles or by being pushed into holes or walls).\n  2. If the count of the sprite avatar reaches zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Careful Navigation**: Move the avatar strategically, always being aware of the laser direction and the hazards present in the environment. Ensure that the avatar is never facing lasers directly unless it is the only safe move.\n  \n2. **Manipulate Environment**: Utilize boxes to shield the avatar from frontal laser shots, and use boulders to manipulate the pathways or potentially trap hazards.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before moving the avatar, assess the surrounding environment for potential pitfalls (like holes or areas with boulders). Ensure that each move does not place the avatar in a position where it can be cornered or trapped by moving lasers or other hazards.\n\n4. **Utilize Obstacles**: Consider how to use boxes and boulders as strategic barriers when engaging with laser cannons or when needing to pass through tight areas (i.e., maneuvering around clustered sprites).\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Focus on reaching the goal without unnecessary distractions, emphasizing the score change mechanism for optimizing level completion.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the puzzle nature of the game, some levels may require experimentation to learn the interactions of various components and find the most efficient path to the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, solve the puzzles within, and achieve their objectives while mitigating the risks presented by the game's mechanics.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n3,1,2,3\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=11, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Avatar Location Analysis\nThe avatar is currently positioned at (10, 1). The surrounding area features walls and a clear path to (12, 1), but the immediate goal is to navigate towards the goal located at (11, 9). \n\n### Key Observations\n- Directly below the avatar is a series of walls, but there are also holes, making vertical navigation risky.\n- The boulders at positions (9, 2) and (10, 2) could provide opportunities to manipulate the environment for safer movement.\n- Moving downward to (11, 1) is blocked by walls, meaning lateral movement must be planned carefully to avoid pitfalls.\n\n### Strategic Approach:\n1. **Evaluate Possible Moves**: The avatar has the option to move left to (10, 1) or right to (12,1) since these positions do not lead directly into walls.\n  \n2. **Manipulate Nearest Boulder**: The boulder at (10, 2) is the most accessible option next to the avatar, and moving it downward may clear space and create a better path toward the goal.\n\n3. **Focus on Safety and Continuity**: Any movement must ensure the avatar is not placing itself into a vulnerable position. The move should also facilitate potential future interactions with other boulders.\n\n4. **Plan Progression**: The eventual aim is to create a safer path downward towards the goal at (11, 9), emphasizing efficiency in navigating through the remaining path.\n\nGiven these observations, moving the boulder downward will help establish more space and potentially clear a pathway toward reaching the goal.\n\n```**Move the boulder at (10, 2) down to (10, 3) to open up safer paths towards the goal at (11, 9).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
