The focus on navigating through spaces, avoiding obstacles, and interacting with different sprites suggests strategic gameplay typical of puzzle games.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Their Properties:** \n  - **Avatar:** Represents the player character, operates by moving around and interacting with other sprites.\n  - **Obstacles:** Includes immovable walls and various types of passive blocks such as boxes and boulders which can be pushed or interacted with.\n  - **Goals:** The objective is represented by a goal sprite, which, when reached by the avatar, results in a score increment.\n  - **Lasers and Boulders:** The game features passive and missile sprites that can interact harmfully with the avatar, particularly the laser which will kill the avatar on contact unless certain conditions (frontal collision) are met.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - Various interactions lay out how the avatar can manipulate surroundings (e.g., bouncing off walls or boxes), and how other sprites respond to each other, adding layers to puzzle-solving.\n  - There are mechanics for avoiding hazards (e.g., being killed by lasers or boulders) and potentially using other sprites (like boxes) as shields.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite ('goal avatar') to complete the level, resulting in a score increase. The goal acts as the endpoint for the avatar. The player must navigate obstacles and avoid hazards effectively to reach this endpoint.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by making the avatar interact with the goal sprite, resulting in a score increase.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is killed, specifically when the `SpriteCounter` for the avatar reaches zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Mapping the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout and note where the walls, holes, and hazards (like lasers) are located.\n   - Identify safe zones and areas where interactions with other sprites can be used strategically.\n\n2. **Utilizing Interactions:**\n   - Use boxes and boulders to shield the avatar from lasers and to manipulate the positions of other sprites, potentially blocking lasers or creating paths to the goal.\n   - Regularly assess the interaction mechanics for potential traps or advantages, such as creating obstacles for pursuing hazards or clearing paths.\n\n3. **Careful Movement:**\n   - Move cautiously, always anticipating where hazards might be and ensuring that the avatar is not within the lethal range of any lasers or boulders.\n   - Always be aware of the avatar's position related to walls and how that affects movement options.\n\n4. **Managing Hazards:**\n   - Avoid moving directly toward lasers unless they are facing away. Use the environment to block their line of sight when necessary. \n   - Strategically place boulders and boxes to create barriers, keeping pathways clear to enable movement toward the goal.\n\n5. **Scoring Opportunities:**\n   - Ensure that the final move to the goal is made with no obstacles that could lead to losing the avatar. Aim to maximize score opportunities while minimizing risk.\n\nBy following this strategy, the player can navigate the game effectively and improve their chances of completing the level while avoiding pitfalls.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The focus on navigating through spaces, avoiding obstacles, and interacting with different sprites suggests strategic gameplay typical of puzzle games.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Their Properties:** \n  - **Avatar:** Represents the player character, operates by moving around and interacting with other sprites.\n  - **Obstacles:** Includes immovable walls and various types of passive blocks such as boxes and boulders which can be pushed or interacted with.\n  - **Goals:** The objective is represented by a goal sprite, which, when reached by the avatar, results in a score increment.\n  - **Lasers and Boulders:** The game features passive and missile sprites that can interact harmfully with the avatar, particularly the laser which will kill the avatar on contact unless certain conditions (frontal collision) are met.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - Various interactions lay out how the avatar can manipulate surroundings (e.g., bouncing off walls or boxes), and how other sprites respond to each other, adding layers to puzzle-solving.\n  - There are mechanics for avoiding hazards (e.g., being killed by lasers or boulders) and potentially using other sprites (like boxes) as shields.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite ('goal avatar') to complete the level, resulting in a score increase. The goal acts as the endpoint for the avatar. The player must navigate obstacles and avoid hazards effectively to reach this endpoint.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by making the avatar interact with the goal sprite, resulting in a score increase.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is killed, specifically when the `SpriteCounter` for the avatar reaches zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Mapping the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout and note where the walls, holes, and hazards (like lasers) are located.\n   - Identify safe zones and areas where interactions with other sprites can be used strategically.\n\n2. **Utilizing Interactions:**\n   - Use boxes and boulders to shield the avatar from lasers and to manipulate the positions of other sprites, potentially blocking lasers or creating paths to the goal.\n   - Regularly assess the interaction mechanics for potential traps or advantages, such as creating obstacles for pursuing hazards or clearing paths.\n\n3. **Careful Movement:**\n   - Move cautiously, always anticipating where hazards might be and ensuring that the avatar is not within the lethal range of any lasers or boulders.\n   - Always be aware of the avatar's position related to walls and how that affects movement options.\n\n4. **Managing Hazards:**\n   - Avoid moving directly toward lasers unless they are facing away.
