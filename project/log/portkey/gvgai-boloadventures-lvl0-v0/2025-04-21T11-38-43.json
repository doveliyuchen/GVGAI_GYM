The components of movement, obstacles, and strategic manipulation of the environment suggest that players must solve problems to advance through the levels.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - The game utilizes various sprites representing walls, goals, hazards, and characters. The 'avatar' can move around, while others, like 'boulders' and 'boxes', can interact in specific ways to aid or hinder progress.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collide with different sprites, triggering various interactions (e.g., transforming, bouncing off, or being killed).\n   - The presence of 'lasercannons' and 'lasers' indicates that players will face hazards that can deal damage under certain conditions (e.g., proximity and direction).\n   \n3. **Goal**: \n   - The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite (denoted by '0'). Achieving this results in a score increase and signifies level completion.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal, which also increases the score (5 points).\n- The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (limit of 0 for the sprite counter indicates failure) or if the player gets trapped in an endless loop of hazards.\n- Specific interactions can kill the avatar, including contact with 'lasers' and falling into 'holes'.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movement**: \n   - Carefully assess the environment before moving the avatar. Use the 'lasers' and 'lasercannons' strategically to avoid hazards.\n\n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders**:\n   - Use the boxes for shelters against lasers and manipulate boulders to create barriers if essential.\n   - Boulders can be moved around or potentially used to interact with other sprites (e.g., pushing them into holes to clear the path).\n\n3. **Navigating Walls**:\n   - The walls are immovable; utilize them to bounce and redirect the avatar strategically to control movement and avoid hazards.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Always approach potential hazards (like lasers or spikes) with caution. Assess their direction before proceeding, as the avatar can be killed if coming into contact with them improperly.\n\n5. **Optimize Pathways**:\n   - Since the level layout has multiple route options, evaluate multiple paths toward the goal. Choose routes that minimize risk while allowing the most efficient movement toward the goal.\n\n6. **Score Awareness**: \n   - Pay attention to score change mechanics. If an action may result in a score reduction (like getting killed), weigh the risk versus rewards.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game combines strategic movement and puzzle-solving. Focus on manipulating the environment while avoiding hazards is vital for successful navigation and progression. Meticulous planning of moves and an understanding of interactions will lead to winning the level while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\nwall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,,,boulder,,hole,wall\nwall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,,boulder,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,,boulder,,hole,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,wall,wall,,,,wall,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,boulder,,boulder,,,,,wall,wall,wall,,wall,wall,wall,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,boulder,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,boulder,boulder,wall,,,,boulder,,,,,,,,wall,lcright lright lright,,,,,,,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,box,,,wall,hole,hole,hole,hole,,,,boulder,,,,hole,wall\nwall,,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,wall\nwall,avatar,,wall,,,,,,,wall,,,,,,,,,,hole,hole,goal,wall\nwall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall,wall\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=1, x=22)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=0, x=0)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Current Location**: \n- The avatar ('a') is located at coordinates (y=10, x=1). Around this position, the surrounding elements include walls (denoted by '*'), holes (denoted by '%'), and a goal (denoted by '$'). \n\n**Surrounding Elements**:\n1. **Top**: Wall (y=9)\n2. **Bottom**: Wall (y=11)\n3. **Left**: Wall (x=0)\n4. **Right**: Wall (x=2)\n5. **Positions Around**: \n   - At (y=10, x=0): Wall\n   - At (y=10, x=2): Wall\n   - At (y=11, x=1): Wall\n   - At (y=9, x=1): Wall\n   - At the bottom of the avatar (y=11, x=1), there's a wall preventing any downward movement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the avatar's immediate surrounding area is entirely enclosed by walls, and there are no items to interact with directly adjacent to the avatar. \n\n### Interactable Items\nThe only opportunities to interact in the immediate surroundings lie further down the level, specifically areas further left (in previous states) or other reachable areas on the screen that contain boulders, holes, etc., some positions have boulders and boxes that can be made use of.\n\n### Strategic Overview\nGiven the current circumstances where movement is fully restricted by walls, the avatar cannot perform any interaction or movement, which indicates that a previous strategic step may not have achieved the intended results, and approach toward reaching the goal needs to reconsider directions.\n\nNext, the avatar should aim to reach interactable items that may unblock paths or facilitate movement towards the goal. Particularly, previous states show that there are boulders at (y=8, x=4) and possibly other areas that can be manipulated. \n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Identify Path**: The only path forward involves determining a way to access the boulders situated not too far away, seeming unreachable directly due to walls.\n2. **Seek Alternatives**: As the avatar cannot move, explore the potential directions or manipulate elements on the screen in future tries that are about strategy leading to the right possible moves other than getting trapped or endlessly looping.\n3. **Observe Environment for Opportunities**: The key is moving along visible paths through walls narrowly, without getting trapped. The avatar has to seek ways leading to accessible states.\n4. **Plan Future Moves**: Since there\u2019s no current action permissible in this round, the strategy will be about contemplating how the avatar could reach items on the next attempt while ensuring to reach goal position optimally.\n\n### Conclusion\nDue to immediate blockage from walls, the avatar needs to rethink its strategy to further leverage interactable elements (boulders and boxes) from past states to pave the way towards reaching the goal, using careful planning of possible future movements.\n\n**Overall summary**: The current location is trapped by walls, and the next strategy should revolve around positioning or planned moves toward boulders not within direct proximity, focusing on avoiding hazards while seeking the goal.\n\n```**Evaluate and prepare to maneuver towards an accessible boulder to manipulate or lead toward the goal from the nearest position after repositioning based on current environmental limitations.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding elements are:\n  - Directly above (y=9, x=1): Wall\n  - Directly below (y=11, x=1): Wall\n  - To the left (y=10, x=0): Wall\n  - To the right (y=10, x=2): Wall\n\nIn summary, the avatar is currently surrounded on all sides by walls ('wall'), creating a completely blocked position. This means no immediate movement can be performed, and there are no items available for interaction in the immediate vicinity.\n\n### Interactable Items Assessment\nTo progress toward the goal:\n- The avatar needs to look for potential future moves.\n- Nearby potential items noted from previous states include boulders and boxes, but they are at locations which are not immediately accessible due to the walls surrounding the avatar.\n\n### Strategic Overview\nGiven that the avatar cannot make any movement currently due to being completely surrounded by walls, the focus should shift toward finding a pathway to interact with boulders and other objects in the nearby regions for future movements.\n\n### Targeting the Goal\n- The ultimate goal is to reach the goal sprite (represented by '$') located nearby at (y=10, x=10).\n- However, before reaching the goal, the avatar may need to clear obstacles, especially since boxes and boulders may have to be maneuvered from a distance.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Reassess Future Moves**: Since current movement is entirely blocked, consider analyzing the previous states for potential interactions in upcoming turns where the avatar could move to strategic positions.\n2. **Plan for Navigation Around Walls**: The immediate focus while trapped is to identify connectable pathways or items that will lead the avatar closer to areas where it's possible for the avatar to move toward or away from walls.\n3. **Analyzing Boulder and Box Location**: The most immediate items (boulders and boxes) are either under blockade or lead to pathways that can unblock more pathways.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe avatar is trapped in its current position with no item interactions available. The strategy must revolve around planning and aligning possible future moves towards interactable items or setting up for the next move where jumping through barriers can be achieved. \n\n**Problematic state reason**: Currently, the avatar cannot reach interactable items or the goal due to being blocked by walls entirely.\n\n```**Focus on analyzing potential pathways and strategize future moves towards accessible boulders or boxes that can open up movement towards the goal, leading the avatar strategically to the goal ($).**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This means that no immediate action can be performed such as moving towards the goal or interacting with any nearby items.\n\n### Interactable Items Assessment\nThe immediate surrounding area does not provide any interactable items. Notable items such as boulders and boxes are located further down the level but are currently blocked by the walls. The avatar cannot access them from its current position.\n\n### Strategic Overview\nSince the avatar is unable to perform any movement, the strategy should focus on:\n1. Identifying potential future moves or pathways that could become available in subsequent turns.\n2. Understanding that the aim of the game is to reach the goal, denoted by '$', located in the vicinity.\n3. Noticing that boxes ('#') and boulders ('@') in the earlier states could be part of the strategy to manipulate routes once the avatar can access them.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Reassess Alternative Routes**: Since movement is blocked, consider possible moves for future attempts or turns. The avatar must strategize for the next move that leads towards an accessible path.\n   \n2. **Identify Nearby Non-Accessible Items**: Although no items are reachable in the current state, take note that boulders and boxes are located at further coordinates, which may need to be manipulated when access is possible.\n   \n3. **Future Movement Planning**: Determine how to effectively navigate around walls to access items and the goal, always ensuring pathways remain clear for maneuvering without getting trapped.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe avatar is currently unable to move due to walls on all sides, which has created a deadlock situation. The strategic focus must remain on preparing for future turns when movement can be initiated, often leading to interactable items or potential pathways to the goal.\n\n**Reason for the state**: The walls completely enclose the avatar's immediate position, and without the ability to interact with surrounding elements, no move can occur.\n\n```**Wait for an opportunity to maneuver around walls by analyzing future placements of the avatar toward nearby boulders and boxes, facilitating access to goal ($) in subsequent turns.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

This situation creates a deadlock where the avatar cannot interact with any items or advance towards the goal ('g') located at (y=10, x=10).\n\n### Interactable Items Assessment\nIn the previous states, there are numerous boulders and boxes scattered around, but they are not within reach of the avatar's current position. The next nearest interactable items are boulders located several spaces away in both the previous positions and the current vision\u2014yet they cannot be accessed from the avatar's current position due to the walls.\n\n### Strategic Overview\nGiven the fact that the avatar cannot move, the focus must be on identifying:\n1. The nearest potential interactions once the situation changes.\n2. The pathways that could potentially clear the avatar's route toward the goal.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Assess Future Opportunities**: Since movement is currently blocked, consider analyzing the surrounding areas for future interactions. The avatar must anticipate what moves will be available once the surroundings are altered or when another opening is found.\n   \n2. **Focus on Future Interactions**: The next possible strategy involves evaluating the boulders and boxes mentioned in previous states to determine how best the avatar could move toward them in the near future.\n   \n3. **Plan Routing Around Walls**: Strategies involving any potential navigation around obstacles for future moves when there is an opening to leverage should be developed and documented.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe avatar currently cannot move due to being tightly surrounded by walls, creating a stalled gameplay situation.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to fall under the puzzle-platformer genre. The components of movement, obstacles, and strategic manipulation of the environment suggest that players must solve problems to advance through the levels.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - The game utilizes various sprites representing walls, goals, hazards, and characters. The 'avatar' can move around, while others, like 'boulders' and 'boxes', can interact in specific ways to aid or hinder progress.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collide with different sprites, triggering various interactions (e.g., transforming, bouncing off, or being killed).\n   - The presence of 'lasercannons' and 'lasers' indicates that players will face hazards that can deal damage under certain conditions (e.g., proximity and direction).\n   \n3. **Goal**: \n   - The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite (denoted by '0'). Achieving this results in a score increase and signifies level completion.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal, which also increases the score (5 points).\n- The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (limit of 0 for the sprite counter indicates failure) or if the player gets trapped in an endless loop of hazards.\n- Specific interactions can kill the avatar, including contact with 'lasers' and falling into 'holes'.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movement**: \n   - Carefully assess the environment before moving the avatar. Use the 'lasers' and 'lasercannons' strategically to avoid hazards.\n\n2. **Use Boxes and Boulders**:\n   - Use the boxes for shelters against lasers and manipulate boulders to create barriers if essential.\n   - Boulders can be moved around or potentially used to interact with other sprites (e.g., pushing them into holes to clear the path).\n\n3. **Navigating Walls**:\n   - The walls are immovable; utilize them to bounce and redirect the avatar strategically to control movement and avoid hazards.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Always approach potential hazards (like lasers or spikes) with caution. Assess their direction before proceeding, as the avatar can be killed if coming into contact with them improperly.\n\n5. **Optimize Pathways**:\n   - Since the level layout has multiple route options, evaluate multiple paths toward the goal. Choose routes that minimize risk while allowing the most efficient movement toward the goal.\n\n6. **Score Awareness**: \n   - Pay attention to score change mechanics. If an action may result in a score reduction (like getting killed), weigh the risk versus rewards.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game combines strategic movement and puzzle-solving. Focus on manipulating the environment while avoiding hazards is vital for successful navigation and progression. Meticulous planning of moves and an understanding of interactions will lead to winning the level while maximizing scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&b.....*\n*@@*...@.......*&b.....*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Action History ===\n0,0,0,0\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=1, x=22)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=1, x=22)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Current Location**: \n- The avatar ('a') is located at coordinates (y=10, x=1), surrounded by walls on all sides:\n  - Above (y=9, x=1): Wall\n  - Below (y=11, x=1): Wall\n  - Left (y=10, x=0): Wall\n  - Right (y=10, x=2): Wall\n\nWith these walls around the avatar, there is currently no possibility of movement or interaction. This deadlock means that the avatar cannot progress toward the goal or interact with any items in this state.\n\n### Interactable Items Assessment\nThe nearest interactable items observed from the previous states are:\n- Boulders ('@') and boxes ('#'), but these are located several spaces away from the avatar and are currently unreachable because the avatar is boxed in by walls.\n\n### Strategic Overview\nSince movement is completely blocked by walls, the current focus should shift to future turns:\n1. Identify potential pathways or opportunities to navigate around the walls once they can be approached or manipulated.\n2. Consider possible pathways that could grant access to boulders or boxes once the conditions change.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Future Route Planning**: Since no interactions can occur this round, the strategy should involve planning for when movement becomes possible. Focus on the layout of the level to identify when and how the avatar may access boulders or boxes.\n   \n2. **Assess Surroundings for Next Move**: The areas adjacent to the walls contain important objects (boulders and boxes) further down that will be useful once pathways are cleared.\n  \n3. **Prepare for Next Opportunity**: As the avatar cannot take direct action now, be ready to take advantage of openings in subsequent moves when walls can be bypassed, or if the game introduces dynamic elements that could rearrange the barriers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe avatar is currently trapped by walls with no possible moves or interactions available. The strategy must now be focused on preparing for future turns and planning potential routes or ways to access nearby boulders and boxes for strategic movement toward the goal.\n\n**Reason for the state**: The avatar's surrounding walls prevent any movement or interaction in the current state.\n\n```**Monitor future opportunities to navigate towards interactable boulders and boxes once the avatar can move, preparing strategies for subsequent turns.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
