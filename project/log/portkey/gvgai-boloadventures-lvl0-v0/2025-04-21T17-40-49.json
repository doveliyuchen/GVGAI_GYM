The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire.

Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites.

Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly.

The combination of strategic movement and interaction with game elements to solve objectives suggests a focus on spatial awareness and problem-solving.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are immovable and play classic roles in platformer games; providing boundaries, objectives, and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player character, able to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box, Boulder**: Serve as movable obstacles that can interact with the environment (e.g., moving, killing, or blocking).\n   - **Lasercannon**: Functions as a damaging element, shooting lasers in specified directions that the player must avoid or utilize.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with walls, boxes, boulders, lasers, and the goal, with various consequences (stepping back, bouncing forward, being killed, etc.).\n   - The lasers can kill the avatar depending on their direction relative to the avatar, indicating a need for strategic positioning.\n   - Boulders can change states upon interaction (e.g., being transformed and affecting nearby objects).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to involve moving the avatar to reach the goal while avoiding hazards (like lasers and holes) present in the level. Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

Collecting points through various interactions (e.g., manipulating blocks and killing other sprites) can also be a secondary objective.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal, which leads to a score change of 5 and ends the game.\n- The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s counter reaches zero. This could happen through various interactions that lead to the avatar being killed (e.g., stepping on a hole or getting hit by a laser).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the position of lasers and try to stay out of their line of fire. Use walls and boxes as shields where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes and Boulders**: The interactions hint that boxes can provide protection from frontal lasers and may affect the movement of other sprites. Use them to strategically block lasers or to create pathways.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, ensure that there\u2019s a safe path to avoid instantly falling into holes or stepping into the range of lasers.\n\n4. **Progressive Engagement**: Engage with the boulders and boxes to manipulate their positions to solve the puzzles in the most efficient manner possibly using them to walk through areas where it would otherwise be unsafe.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**: If points accumulation is important, identify which sprite interactions can yield more points (e.g., killing boulders or other sprites) and incorporate these into your path to the goal.\n\n6. **Level Familiarization**: Spend a moment familiarizing yourself with the level layout (as shown in the diagram), identifying clear routes versus potentially hazardous routes, to make smarter movement decisions.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively while minimizing the risk of dying due to environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*.@*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@a*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*.@*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@a*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*..*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 8, col = 2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 8, col = 2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
