    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game seems to fall into the puzzle-platformer genre. It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key.

Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

I am also aware of upcoming threats such as holes ('%') that could hinder my navigation.\n\nGiven my position and the overall strategy to interact with the '&' sprites in order to manipulate the environment, the best next move seems to be **moving down** to explore further options on the lower row (11, 1), as it remains a significant area with potential items to interact with. This will help me see if there are additional pathways open below.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nBy moving down, I hope to open new navigation paths and reassess my options toward reaching the '&' sprites and eventually the goal sprite, while keeping an eye on the layout changes of the nearby sprites.",

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game seems to fall into the puzzle-platformer genre. It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game seems to fall into the puzzle-platformer genre. It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game seems to fall into the puzzle-platformer genre. It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game seems to fall into the puzzle-platformer genre. It combines elements of platforming with strategic interactions between various sprites, likely requiring the player to solve spatial and logical challenges to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes), and dangerous elements (lasers). Each sprite has specific interactions which can affect the game state.\n  \n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can interact with multiple sprites, leading to various consequences:\n   - The avatar can be killed by lasers or by falling into a hole.\n   - Boxes can act as shields against lasers if positioned correctly.\n   - Boulders can transform when interacting with other boulders or walls.\n  \n3. **Scoring:** The goal of the game is to move the avatar to the goal sprite, which grants points (scoreChange=5). Additionally, certain interactions can yield scores, for example, killing sprites, such as boulders when they meet the right conditions.\n\n4. **Obstacles:** The presence of walls, holes, barrels, and other obstacles create a challenging environment that requires careful planning and timing to navigate.\n\n5. **Spawner and Projectiles:** Lasers spawn from cannons and will kill the avatar if hit. Timing and positioning will be critical to avoid these projectiles.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe player must navigate the avatar to the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (like lasers and holes) and manipulating the environment using boxes and boulders. The objective is accomplished by reaching the goal sprite ('goal') which will trigger a win condition and provide a score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- Loss Condition: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0 (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Areas:** Be cautious while moving near holes and lasers. Plan movements to avoid contact with lasers by creating barriers with boxes when possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:** Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers. Place them in a way to block the lasers' paths while you navigate through the level.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulders and Wall Interactions:** Take advantage of the interactions between boulders, walls, and other sprites to create safe pathways. For example, initiating fouls with boulders can clear paths or create barriers.\n\n4. **Timing of Movements:** Timing is crucial when dealing with lasers. Observe their movement patterns and plan moves accordingly, ensuring you can navigate to safety without being hit.\n\n5. **Maximize Score Opportunities:** If possible, seek to interact with sprites that yield bonus points while on your way to the goal. The interaction between boulders and holes to kill also provides scoring potential.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Given the puzzle-like nature of the game, anticipating consequences of actions will be key. If manipulating an element (like pushing a boulder or box), think about the future interactions you might provoke.\n\nBy employing these strategies and maintaining awareness of the game's dynamics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating through the levels and reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.
