    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules and level layout, the game appears to be a classic puzzle/platformer with elements of strategy. The sprites suggest an environment where players must navigate through obstacles, use items or characters to solve puzzles, and achieve a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Roles**:\n    - **Ground, Walls, Holes, Goal**: These are immovable objects that define the game's structure and boundaries.\n    - **Avatar**: The player's character that can interact with the game environment.\n    - **Boxes, Boulder, and Lasercannons**: These are dynamic elements that interact with the avatar and affect gameplay.\n    - **Laser**: Represents a lethal hazard that can kill the avatar based on its frontal approach.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n    - Various interactions allow the avatar to move, transform, or be affected by other sprites.\n    - For example, the avatar can \"bounce\" off walls or boxes, retreat when colliding with walls or lasers, or transform into a different sprite when contacting a boulder.\n  \n3. **Scoring and Winning**: \n    - Players score points by manipulating elements within the level, specifically by causing interactions that yield score changes (e.g., transforming boulders into \u201ckilled\u201d states).\n    - Reaching the goal, signified by an interaction with the \"goal\" sprite, grants substantial points and leads to winning.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the level while avoiding hazards and obstacles, ultimately reaching the goal sprite. In addition to reaching the goal, players can accumulate points through various interactions (like killing sprites or overcoming challenges).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar successfully interacts with the goal, leading to a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is transformed into a sprite that leads to a SpriteCounter reaching zero. Encounters with walls, lasers, and other harmful sprites can lead to failure.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: The initial step should be to understand the layout and identify safe paths to the goal while noting where the hazards are located.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**:\n    - Position boxes to shield the avatar from lasers, effectively using them as barriers.\n    - Boxes can also bounce the avatar away from danger, so planning their placement can create safer paths.\n\n3. **Avoid the Lasers**: \n    - Since lasers can outright kill the avatar depending on their approach, identify safe passages well before engaging. Always approach lasers carefully to avoid frontal encounters.\n\n4. **Manage Boulders**:\n    - Manipulate boulders to open pathways or block lasers if possible.\n    - Pay attention to changing boulders into \"boulderm\" after collisions to avoid danger, which may create pathways or influence other dynamic elements.\n\n5. **Progress Gradually**: \n    - Move strategically, progressing a few steps at a time, to ensure safe passage while avoiding rapid, reckless movements that could lead to hazards.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**:\n    - Actively pursue opportunities for scoring by engaging with the game's dynamics and seeking transformations that yield points.\n    - Look for chances to eliminate sprites that grant score changes, balancing the pursuit of the goal with point accumulation.\n\nBy combining careful navigation, strategic use of interactive objects, caution around hazards, and maximizing scoring opportunities, players can navigate through the game effectively toward victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy.

As per the layout, 'a' is surrounded on three sides by several items and obstacles. Notably, the avatar is in proximity to a risky spot with multiple interactions:\n\n- To the right of 'a' (at (11, 2)), there is a wall in the form of a laser which poses an immediate threat.\n- Directly below 'a' (at (12, 1)), there is a wall.\n- To the left (at (11, 0)), there is a wall.\n- There are several dynamic objects (like '@' and '&') that potentially alter the gameplay.\n\n#### Potential for Interaction\nConsidering the current state, a key item near 'a' is the 'box' (represented by '*') located below and to the left. The player must consider how to leverage the box for safe passage or scoring.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Utilize the Box**: The box offers a tactical advantage in this setup. By moving the box adjacent to the avatar, the player can potentially use it to shield against the laser to the north, thus creating a safe maneuvering space.\n  \n2. **Formulate a Path Forward**: The box can be used to create pathways or barriers that will keep the avatar away from hazards (lasers), while also providing an opportunity to reach open paths leading to the goal or further interaction with dynamic elements.\n\n3. **Avoid Direct Hazards**: Ensure that any moves do not lead directly into hazards. The surrounding lasers present the highest risk and must be effectively navigated around.\n\n4. **Plan for Future Moves**: Moving the box should be in favor of not just immediate safety but also better positioning for future moves. This involves preparing a route that avoids potential traps and allows access to more scoring opportunities.\n\n### High-Level Move Action\nInteract with the nearby **box ( * )** to create a barrier against the threatening litter of lasers, ensuring a safe pathway for future moves and interactions. This emphasizes a balanced approach between avoiding immediate hazards while setting up for progressive advancement towards objectives and maximizing scores along the way.\n\n```**Interacting with the box ( * ) to create a strategic barrier against incoming hazards while positioning for future moves and scoring opportunities.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The current state reflects a new tube-like environment, where nearly all sides are surrounded by walls, making movement options extremely limited.\n\nThe surroundings, considering the walls, limit the avatar's direct access to items or safe pathways. As per the layout:\n- **North (10, 1)**: A wall ('b') is directly above.\n- **East (11, 2)**: A wall ('b') is directly to the right.\n- **South (12, 1)**: A wall ('b') is directly below.\n- **West (11, 0)**: A wall ('b') is directly to the left.\n\nGiven the new state, the avatar's options for interaction are severely restricted, creating a challenging situation that likely requires a repositioning of adjacent items.\n\n#### Potential for Interaction\nCurrently, the avatar cannot make any movements in the standard left, right, up, or down directions due to walls. However, the avatar is next to interactive items:\n- '.': Represented as spaces which may allow interaction through scores.\n- '*': There are boxes located at (12, 2) and (12, 3) to the northwest, and potentially additional elements surrounding that may bear interaction.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Focus on the Boxes**: The immediate area has two boxes represented by '*', particularly available at (12, 3). Interacting with this box can facilitate additional future moves for clearing paths or creating barriers.\n\n2. **Create Pathways**: The interaction with the boxes will enhance the avatar's ability to navigate around, as moving a box could potentially open a new route through the level's structure. This may allow players to transition away from being trapped and towards interaction with other useful items or paths.\n\n3. **Plan for Future Interactions**: Assess future pathways once the box is maneuvered, aiming to unlock potential scoring opportunities or paths toward the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Though the laser threat from the previous state doesn\u2019t seem directly applicable in the present state, establishing a route that circumvents overall hazardous positions in future turns is important. \n\nThe essential move action indicates the following:\n\n```**Interact with the box ( * ) at (12, 3) to unlock potential pathways and create a strategy for future movements and interactions.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

These boxes, once accessible, can be moved into strategic positions allowing for a route towards other unblocked areas for scoring or approaching the goal.\n\n3. **Continue Navigation**: Exploring potential interactions with the boxes is crucial as they may facilitate the avatar's movement through dynamic paths and offer ways to escape the current blocked state.\n\n4. **Look for Scores**: After interacting with the boxes next available, ensure that any movement pattern centers on assessing both pathways towards the concern of reaching the goal, while also looking for options to accumulate score opportunities.\n\nThis leads to the next action being focused on the eventual goal once movement is possible:\n\n```**Strategize to interact with the boxes ( * ) located at (12, 2) and (12, 3) to enable movement options that allow for future progress towards the goal and scoring opportunities.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The state reflects that the avatar is surrounded by walls ('b') on all sides, which impedes movement options completely.\n\n#### Surroundings:\n- **North (10, 1)**: Wall ('b')\n- **East (11, 2)**: Wall ('b')\n- **South (12, 1)**: Wall ('b')\n- **West (11, 0)**: Wall ('b')\n\nThe avatar is therefore unable to progress toward any nearby challenges, as every potential movement leads directly into a wall, rendering the space somewhat of a \u201ctrap.\u201d\n\n### Potential for Interaction\nIn the current state, no other items, obstacles, or advantageous objects are accessible since they are effectively out of the avatar's reach due to the surrounding walls.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\nGiven that the avatar cannot move or interact with any items in the immediate vicinity due to walls completely encasing it, the next best strategic option involves planning for eventual interaction once an opportunity arises. \n\n1. **Examine Future Opportunities**: Since the current state prevents any progress, the focus should be on anticipating future interaction possibilities. Once the avatar is able to interact or move, the available boxes at (12, 2) and (12, 3) may become crucial for breaking through the restriction imposed by the walls.\n\n2. **Mapping Potential Paths**: By assessing the layout and potential areas of movement beyond this constrained space, the strategy can include successfully manipulating boxes into situations that will enable pathways out of this immediate deadlock and toward the goal.\n\n3. **Preparing for Interaction**: Once the movement becomes possible\u2014whether through interactions or items being reached\u2014the strategy should include leveraging the items (e.g., boxes) to orient towards escaping confinement and maximizing future moves.\n\nIn light of the current immobilized position of the avatar:\n\n```**Plan to interact with the boxes ( * ) located in future moves to enable an escape from the enclosed space and facilitate progression towards the goal and scoring opportunities.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The sprites suggest an environment where players must navigate through obstacles, use items or characters to solve puzzles, and achieve a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Roles**:\n    - **Ground, Walls, Holes, Goal**: These are immovable objects that define the game's structure and boundaries.\n    - **Avatar**: The player's character that can interact with the game environment.\n    - **Boxes, Boulder, and Lasercannons**: These are dynamic elements that interact with the avatar and affect gameplay.\n    - **Laser**: Represents a lethal hazard that can kill the avatar based on its frontal approach.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n    - Various interactions allow the avatar to move, transform, or be affected by other sprites.\n    - For example, the avatar can \"bounce\" off walls or boxes, retreat when colliding with walls or lasers, or transform into a different sprite when contacting a boulder.\n  \n3. **Scoring and Winning**: \n    - Players score points by manipulating elements within the level, specifically by causing interactions that yield score changes (e.g., transforming boulders into \u201ckilled\u201d states).\n    - Reaching the goal, signified by an interaction with the \"goal\" sprite, grants substantial points and leads to winning.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the level while avoiding hazards and obstacles, ultimately reaching the goal sprite. In addition to reaching the goal, players can accumulate points through various interactions (like killing sprites or overcoming challenges).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar successfully interacts with the goal, leading to a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is transformed into a sprite that leads to a SpriteCounter reaching zero. Encounters with walls, lasers, and other harmful sprites can lead to failure.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: The initial step should be to understand the layout and identify safe paths to the goal while noting where the hazards are located.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**:\n    - Position boxes to shield the avatar from lasers, effectively using them as barriers.\n    - Boxes can also bounce the avatar away from danger, so planning their placement can create safer paths.\n\n3. **Avoid the Lasers**: \n    - Since lasers can outright kill the avatar depending on their approach, identify safe passages well before engaging. Always approach lasers carefully to avoid frontal encounters.\n\n4. **Manage Boulders**:\n    - Manipulate boulders to open pathways or block lasers if possible.\n    - Pay attention to changing boulders into \"boulderm\" after collisions to avoid danger, which may create pathways or influence other dynamic elements.\n\n5. **Progress Gradually**: \n    - Move strategically, progressing a few steps at a time, to ensure safe passage while avoiding rapid, reckless movements that could lead to hazards.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**:\n    - Actively pursue opportunities for scoring by engaging with the game's dynamics and seeking transformations that yield points.\n    - Look for chances to eliminate sprites that grant score changes, balancing the pursuit of the goal with point accumulation.\n\nBy combining careful navigation, strategic use of interactive objects, caution around hazards, and maximizing scoring opportunities, players can navigate through the game effectively toward victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

This position is densely surrounded by walls ('b') on all sides, leading to an entirely restricted movement potential\u2014essentially trapping the avatar in this state.\n\n#### Surroundings:\n- **North (10, 1)**: Wall ('b')\n- **East (11, 2)**: Wall ('b')\n- **South (12, 1)**: Wall ('b')\n- **West (11, 0)**: Wall ('b')\n\nThere are no immediate escape routes or items available for interaction within the avatar's reachable range.\n\n### Potential for Interaction\nIn this state, there are two notable item types to consider nearby:\n- **Goal ('%')**: Located at various positions, but not reachable at the moment since they are trapped by walls.\n- **Boxes ('*')**: There are boxes located at (12, 2) and (12, 3) that can be strategically used.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Utilize Surrounding Boxes**: The primary focus should be to interact with the accessible boxes in future moves since they offer the only viable option to manipulate obstacles surrounding the avatar.\n  \n2. **Prepare for Potential Moves**: While the current state is restrictive, observe and plan for when the position can be accessed to initiate moves with the boxes. The approach should be to dodge the wall directly surrounding while optimizing potential routes toward escaping the confines.\n\n3. **Score Maximization Preparation**: Managing box placement will not only help in escaping but can also serve a dual purpose of preparing the environment for scoring opportunities, as proper box positioning can potentially create scoring routes as the game unfolds.\n\nConclusively, since the avatar cannot undertake any immediate action due to being trapped, the next move's focus should remain on these boxes to facilitate future escape plans.\n\n```**Plan to interact with the boxes ( * ) located at (12, 2) and (12, 3) when movement becomes possible to create pathways that allow escape from restriction and progress toward goal and scoring opportunities.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The only objects of interest would be the boxes ('*') when accessibility is restored.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Assess Future Opportunities**: Since the avatar cannot currently move or interact with anything, the best strategy is to prepare for future moves. When the position opens, interaction with the boxes located at (12, 2) and (12, 3) could be crucial.\n\n2. **Plan Box Utilization**: The boxes will be key to creating pathways that may allow the avatar to bypass the walls that currently block all movements. By thinking ahead, the placement of boxes should focus on creating potential exits once the surrounding walls no longer confine the avatar.\n\n3. **Maximize Scoring Potential**: As soon as movement is possible, the plan should also include using the boxes not only to escape but to create opportunities to gain scores by interacting with other items (like reaching the goal '%').\n\nGiven the inability to act presently due to walls blocking each potential movement option, the strategy will focus on preparing for the potential interactions with boxes once those become feasible.\n\n```**Prepare to interact with the boxes ( * ) located at (12, 2) and (12, 3) once movement becomes possible, to create pathways that facilitate escape and progress towards reaching the goal and maximizing scoring opportunities.**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.
