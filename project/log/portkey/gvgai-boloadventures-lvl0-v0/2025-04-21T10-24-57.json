It involves navigating through a level filled with various interactive objects, while managing obstacles and enemies to reach a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game includes sprites like walls, holes, goals, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons, each with specific interactivity and effects when the avatar interacts with them.\n2. **Avatar Movement:**\n   - Controlled via an avatar that can interact with other sprites, protected in certain situations by boxes, and affected by boulders and lasers based on the direction of engagement.\n3. **Transformations and Effects:**\n   - Objects can transform into other states (e.g., boulders into rolling boulders) and the player can trigger specific effects based on their interactions (e.g., killing the avatar or score changes).\n4. **Score System:**\n   - Players earn points by successfully navigating the level, with a significant score increase upon reaching the goal.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the goal sprite while managing dangers from obstacles and interacting wisely with the environment to maximize scoring.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by moving the avatar to the goal sprite, resulting in the avatar's elimination and a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is eliminated by hazards (e.g., lasers, boulders) or if there are no avatars left (indicated by the sprite counter set to 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Understand the level layout thoroughly. Pay attention to walls, paths, and the placement of hazards and useful objects (like boxes for protection).\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes strategically as shields against threats (like lasers). Position them to absorb hits and create opportunities to move through dangerous areas.\n\n3. **Watch for Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious of the boulders and lasers. Avoid confrontation when possible; understand how they transform the environment and how they kill the avatar.\n  \n4. **Manage Boulders:**\n   - Use boulders tactically; for example, trying to lure them into holes to eliminate them and potentially access otherwise blocked areas.\n  \n5. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Since the goal is located within the level, planning a comprehensive path while considering the interactions of different sprites is crucial for success.\n  \n6. **Iterate and Learn:**\n   - Be prepared for trial and error. Since some interactions can lead to unexpected outcomes (e.g., transforming boulders, activating cannons), experiment with different strategies until you find the optimal route to the goal.\n  \nBy following these strategies while being responsive to the dynamic interplay of various sprites, players can successfully navigate to the goal and maximize their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The critical points here are the boulders (`@`) and the holes that can affect the avatar's movement and safety.\n\n**Current Immediate Objective:**\nYour primary aim is to navigate the avatar safely towards the goal (`$`). This requires careful management of the nearby boulders and avoiding hazards. The avatar is currently trapped and must maneuver through the available tiles to reach the goal efficiently.\n\n### Action Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Surroundings:**\n   - The avatar is positioned such that it can only move down or to the right. Evaluate the tiles that can be traversed while avoiding immediate contact with dangerous sprites.\n\n2. **Available Moves:**\n   - The avatar currently has the following immediate possible moves:\n     - Move Down (`lcdown`) into a wall or hole: Not recommended.\n     - Move Right (`lcright`): Open space is available (but beware of adjacent tiles).\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) towards tile `0`. This allows further movement into an open space while keeping away from boulders and hazards for the next turn.\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - If no change occurs in the activation of hazards (i.e., no new boulders rolling, no lasers becoming active), and if the tile below the avatar remains blocked or hazardous, be prepared to change actions accordingly.\n\n5. **Future Considerations:**\n   - After moving right:\n     - Evaluate the tiles available for the next action: whether it\u2019s further action right, or changing direction and moving down to access the pathways leading closer to the goal.\n     - Keep track of the boulders and any potential movements towards hazards (like lasers) which could lead to avatar elimination.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Move the avatar to the **Right** immediately (`lcright`). Ensure to observe any changes in the surrounding states after your move. If the path becomes impassable or if hazards activate, reassess and change the direction as needed to optimize your strategy towards reaching the goal. Remember to continuously analyze the dynamic environment to maximize safety and efficiency in reaching the goal ($).\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The immediate requirement is to determine the best move towards reaching the goal.\n\n**Immediate Objective:**\nYou must guide the avatar to the goal (`$`) while avoiding hazards (like hard walls and boulders). Since the game mechanics dictate that the avatar will be eliminated upon reaching the goal, we can focus on the safest path without risk of hazard.\n\n### Action Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Surroundings:**\n   - The avatar currently has the following potential moves:\n     - **Up** (`lcup`): This is not possible due to walls above.\n     - **Down** (`lcdown`): This leads into more walls, which is not advisable.\n     - **Left** (`lcleft`): Blocked by the wall.\n     - **Right** (`lcright`): This tile is open, with the path leading towards a wall and other interactions.\n\n2. **Evaluate Future States:**\n   - The only feasible move from the avatar's position is to move **Right** into a wall (`lcright`). However, this does not provide a clear path towards the goal as it leads further away from the eventual path required.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Down** (`lcdown`) towards the accessible tile below the avatar for further potential route finding; this step reveals empty space towards movement options.\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - After moving, closely observe the changes in the state configuration around the avatar. If the tiles remain unchanged or if escape routes remain blocked, be prepared to revise your action according to available pathways uncovered by the move.\n\n5. **Future Considerations:**\n   - After moving down:\n     - Determine the available tiles:\n       - **Right (to another wall)** \u2192 Not a safe bet.\n       - **Down (towards a box)** \u2192 May allow utilizing the box for maneuvering further in subsequent turns.\n       - **Left (blocked)** \u2192 No further movements possible.\n     - Use strategic awareness to assess if additional blocks or boulders need management and if advance pathways emerge.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Move the avatar **Down** (`lcdown`). Pay attention after the move; if the surroundings do not change significantly (no new pathways open or hazards activated), be ready to change your approach in the next turn. Your focus should be on finding a more manageable route toward reaching the goal (`$`) while eliminating unnecessary hazards along the way.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding space includes walls, holes (`%`), and potential routes towards the goal (`$`). The only nearby objects of interest are the hole above and the goal to the right.\n\n**Immediate Objective:**\nThe goal is to navigate the avatar safely towards the goal icon while sidestepping potential hazards from walls and other obstacles like boulders.\n\n### Action Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Surroundings:**\n   - The current legal moves for the avatar are:\n     - **Up** (`lcup`): This move is blocked by the wall directly above the avatar.\n     - **Down** (`lcdown`): This move would place the avatar on a wall; not permissible.\n     - **Left** (`lcleft`): This move is blocked by the wall on the left.\n     - **Right** (`lcright`): This path leads to the goal, which is an achievable move.\n\n2. **Evaluate Future Moves:**\n   - Since the primary move to achieve the goal is to move **Right** into an empty tile leading to the goal, this seems advantageous. It keeps the avatar moving towards the objective while avoiding hazards.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) towards the goal (`$`). This will promptly lead to the elimination of the avatar and thus trigger the end game condition favorably by scoring 5 points.\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - Ensure that the action taken is correctly executed and leads the avatar to the goal. Any failure to reach the goal or presentations of new hazards should be noted for adjustments in the next round.\n\n5. **Future Consideration:**\n   - If for any reason the move **Right** does not yield expected results (e.g., blocked again by an unforeseen event), be prepared to analyze the re-emerging routes and evaluate next potential actions, such as retreating back or exploring for available box options to sidestep hazards.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Execute the movement **Right** (`lcright`) towards the goal (`$`). This action is intended to achieve the win condition\u2014reaching the goal and ending the game successfully.

It involves navigating through a level filled with various interactive objects, while managing obstacles and enemies to reach a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game includes sprites like walls, holes, goals, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons, each with specific interactivity and effects when the avatar interacts with them.\n2. **Avatar Movement:**\n   - Controlled via an avatar that can interact with other sprites, protected in certain situations by boxes, and affected by boulders and lasers based on the direction of engagement.\n3. **Transformations and Effects:**\n   - Objects can transform into other states (e.g., boulders into rolling boulders) and the player can trigger specific effects based on their interactions (e.g., killing the avatar or score changes).\n4. **Score System:**\n   - Players earn points by successfully navigating the level, with a significant score increase upon reaching the goal.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the goal sprite while managing dangers from obstacles and interacting wisely with the environment to maximize scoring.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by moving the avatar to the goal sprite, resulting in the avatar's elimination and a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is eliminated by hazards (e.g., lasers, boulders) or if there are no avatars left (indicated by the sprite counter set to 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Understand the level layout thoroughly. Pay attention to walls, paths, and the placement of hazards and useful objects (like boxes for protection).\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes strategically as shields against threats (like lasers). Position them to absorb hits and create opportunities to move through dangerous areas.\n\n3. **Watch for Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious of the boulders and lasers. Avoid confrontation when possible; understand how they transform the environment and how they kill the avatar.\n  \n4. **Manage Boulders:**\n   - Use boulders tactically; for example, trying to lure them into holes to eliminate them and potentially access otherwise blocked areas.\n  \n5. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Since the goal is located within the level, planning a comprehensive path while considering the interactions of different sprites is crucial for success.\n  \n6. **Iterate and Learn:**\n   - Be prepared for trial and error. Since some interactions can lead to unexpected outcomes (e.g., transforming boulders, activating cannons), experiment with different strategies until you find the optimal route to the goal.\n  \nBy following these strategies while being responsive to the dynamic interplay of various sprites, players can successfully navigate to the goal and maximize their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The presence of holes may pose a hazard, but the primary objective remains to reach the goal.\n\n**Immediate Objective:**\nGuide the avatar towards the goal without triggering hazards from holes or other obstacles.\n\n### Action Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Surroundings:**\n   - The possible movements for the avatar are:\n     - **Up (`lcup`)**: Blocked by walls.\n     - **Down (`lcdown`)**: Blocked by walls.\n     - **Left (`lcleft`)**: Blocked by walls.\n     - **Right (`lcright`)**: This leads to the goal (`$`).\n\n2. **Evaluate Next Move:**\n   - The only viable move is to move **Right** (`lcright`) toward the goal (`$`). This action will fulfill the win condition, leading to the avatar's elimination and scoring a total of 5 points.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) toward the goal (`$`). This will successfully end the game in the player's favor.\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - After executing the move, verify that the action indeed leads to reaching the goal. Any unexpected outcomes should be closely observed to ascertain if alternative strategies need to be considered.\n\n5. **Future Considerations:**\n   - In this specific instance, if the right movement successfully leads to the goal, no further future considerations are necessary. However, should moving right unexpectedly fail or result in the avatar being trapped or eliminated, be prepared to re-evaluate and adjust your movement accordingly.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) toward the goal (`$`). This action is strategically sound as it is intended to achieve the win condition. If any issues arise preventing this outcome, be ready to adapt your approach in subsequent turns based on changes in the game state.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The only significant feature to its right is a hole (`%`) followed by the goal (`$`). The immediate strategy should focus on how to navigate towards the goal without getting eliminated by hazards.\n\n**Immediate Objective:**\nGuide the avatar towards the goal (`$`) while managing potential hazards from the surrounding environment.\n\n### Action Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Surroundings:**\n   - Potential movements available to the avatar are:\n     - **Up (`lcup`)**: Blocked by walls above.\n     - **Down (`lcdown`)**: Blocked by walls below.\n     - **Left (`lcleft`)**: Blocked by walls to the left.\n     - **Right (`lcright`)**: This leads to an empty space and continues towards the hole and ultimately the goal.\n\n2. **Evaluate Next Move:**\n   - The action of moving **Right** (`lcright`) is crucial as it permits movement toward the goal (`$`). It represents a clear path to winning.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) toward the goal (`$`). This will allow reaching the win condition directly since moving into the goal will eliminate the avatar and end the game positively.\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - After executing the action to the right, verify that the move leads directly into the goal (`$`). If something unexpected happens (like traps or walls appearing), be prepared to adjust in your next round based on the situation's developments.\n\n5. **Future Considerations:**\n   - Given the current scenario, if moving right successfully allows you to reach the goal, there won't be a need for immediate future actions. However, if the goal is obstructed for any reason, analyze further available movements to navigate through the surrounding area wisely.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) towards the goal (`$`). This action aims to secure a win condition. If your move does not produce the intended result, adapt to the immediate changes in the game state and plan your next move accordingly.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Moving right will place the avatar on a hole before reaching the goal. This is crucial because it allows us to determine if the hole presents a hazard.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) toward the hole (`%`). Since the hole could potentially eliminate the avatar, it\u2019s critical to understand the effects of interacting with it. Upon moving right, the next intended movement would be to reach the goal, which results in winning.\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - After executing the rightward move, observe if the interaction with the hole eliminates the avatar or if it allows reaching the goal without penalty. If the avatar gets eliminated, the strategy failed, and the next actions should be reconsidered.\n\n5. **Future Considerations:**\n   - If moving right leads to successful completion, no further actions are necessary. If the avatar\u2019s movement does not end favorably, strategize alternatives based on the outcome and adapt in the subsequent turns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) toward the hole (`%`) with the intention of progressing to the goal (`$`). This will advance the game toward a winning condition.

The immediate concern is to navigate towards the goal while managing the risk presented by the hole.\n\n**Immediate Objective:**\nGuide the avatar to the goal (`$`) while carefully maneuvering around potential hazards.\n\n### Action Strategy\n\n1. **Assess Surroundings:**\n   - Possible movements for the avatar:\n     - **Up (`lcup`)**: Blocked by a wall.\n     - **Down (`lcdown`)**: Blocked by a wall.\n     - **Left (`lcleft`)**: Blocked by a wall.\n     - **Right (`lcright`)**: Leads to the hole (`%`) just before reaching the goal (`$`).\n\n2. **Evaluate Next Move:**\n   - Moving **Right** (`lcright`) will place the avatar on the hole before reaching the goal. It is essential to recognize whether interacting with the hole will eliminate the avatar or allow progression to the goal.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   - **Proposed Action:** Move **Right** (`lcright`). This should lead to the hole, and then the next potential action would be to step into the goal (`$`).\n\n4. **Monitor State Changes:**\n   - After executing the action to the right, closely observe whether the avatar gets eliminated by the hole or whether it can successfully reach the goal. If the move leads to hazard elimination without reaching the goal, revisit the strategy.\n\n5. **Future Considerations:**\n   - If moving right successfully leads to winning by reaching the goal, no further actions are required. If the move does not lead to winning, reassess the situation based on the resulting changes in the game state.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Action Alert:** Move **Right** (`lcright`) towards the hole (`%`). This action leads to the goal (`$`). Assess the situation closely after this move, and be ready to recalibrate your strategy if the expected result does not occur.\n\n\nPlease choose the meaningful action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

It involves navigating through a level filled with various interactive objects, while managing obstacles and enemies to reach a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game includes sprites like walls, holes, goals, boxes, boulders, lasers, and cannons, each with specific interactivity and effects when the avatar interacts with them.\n2. **Avatar Movement:**\n   - Controlled via an avatar that can interact with other sprites, protected in certain situations by boxes, and affected by boulders and lasers based on the direction of engagement.\n3. **Transformations and Effects:**\n   - Objects can transform into other states (e.g., boulders into rolling boulders) and the player can trigger specific effects based on their interactions (e.g., killing the avatar or score changes).\n4. **Score System:**\n   - Players earn points by successfully navigating the level, with a significant score increase upon reaching the goal.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the goal sprite while managing dangers from obstacles and interacting wisely with the environment to maximize scoring.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by moving the avatar to the goal sprite, resulting in the avatar's elimination and a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is eliminated by hazards (e.g., lasers, boulders) or if there are no avatars left (indicated by the sprite counter set to 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Understand the level layout thoroughly. Pay attention to walls, paths, and the placement of hazards and useful objects (like boxes for protection).\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes:**\n   - Use boxes strategically as shields against threats (like lasers). Position them to absorb hits and create opportunities to move through dangerous areas.\n\n3. **Watch for Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious of the boulders and lasers. Avoid confrontation when possible; understand how they transform the environment and how they kill the avatar.\n  \n4. **Manage Boulders:**\n   - Use boulders tactically; for example, trying to lure them into holes to eliminate them and potentially access otherwise blocked areas.\n  \n5. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Since the goal is located within the level, planning a comprehensive path while considering the interactions of different sprites is crucial for success.\n  \n6. **Iterate and Learn:**\n   - Be prepared for trial and error.
