It incorporates obstacle navigation and strategic movement, requiring players to manipulate the environment and their character (the avatar) to reach the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites that serve different functions, such as walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals. Each sprite has defined properties and interactions with others.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can manipulate boxes and boulders to interact with other objects (e.g., shields against lasers, killing hazards, etc.).\n  - Certain interactions produce specific outcomes like transforming, stepping back, attracting gaze, or killing sprites upon collision.\n  - The avatar has to navigate through the environment using the properties of the sprites wisely to avoid hazards and reach the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`) while avoiding being killed by lasers or falling into holes. Successfully reaching the goal contributes towards the score, indicating a clear victory condition (win=True if `goal` sprite's counter is at zero).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the `goal` sprite is countered down to zero (indicated by a successful interaction with the avatar).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the `avatar` sprite counter reaches zero, meaning the avatar has been eliminated in some manner (e.g., killed by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understanding Hazards**: Take note of where lasers are located and the direction they face. The avatar must approach them carefully either from the front to eliminate hazards or from the sides to avoid being killed.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Strategically use boxes and boulders to create barriers against lasers. Since certain interactions allow the avatar to shield against lasers, consider employing the blocks as shields when navigating through areas with laser cannons.\n\n3. **Efficient Navigation**: Be mindful of your movement. Avoid unnecessary backtracking to minimize actions that may lead to being cornered or encountering hazards.\n\n4. **Interaction Sequences**: Examine sequences of interactions with sprites. For example, triggering a boulder to fall into a hole while positioning the avatar away from danger can allow for potential score increases.\n\n5. **Mapping Out the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout (walls, boxes, holes, and goal positioning) to devise a clear path to the goal while anticipating potential encounters with hazards.\n\n6. **Plan Escape Routes**: Always have a secondary route in mind to retreat or circumvent traps when progressing towards the goal, especially in tight spaces where multiple laser sources are present.\n\nThis strategic approach should help navigate the challenges presented in the game effectively while aiming for maximum score accumulation and reaching the end goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&......*\n*@@*...@.......*&......*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nTo progress effectively towards the goal, strategically maneuver the avatar to utilize nearby boulders as barriers against hazards while systematically clearing the path to the goal, but be prepared to adjust the approach immediately if obstacles or hazards change in position.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",

Each sprite has defined properties and interactions with others.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can manipulate boxes and boulders to interact with other objects (e.g., shields against lasers, killing hazards, etc.).\n  - Certain interactions produce specific outcomes like transforming, stepping back, attracting gaze, or killing sprites upon collision.\n  - The avatar has to navigate through the environment using the properties of the sprites wisely to avoid hazards and reach the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`) while avoiding being killed by lasers or falling into holes.

It incorporates obstacle navigation and strategic movement, requiring players to manipulate the environment and their character (the avatar) to reach the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites that serve different functions, such as walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals. Each sprite has defined properties and interactions with others.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can manipulate boxes and boulders to interact with other objects (e.g., shields against lasers, killing hazards, etc.).\n  - Certain interactions produce specific outcomes like transforming, stepping back, attracting gaze, or killing sprites upon collision.\n  - The avatar has to navigate through the environment using the properties of the sprites wisely to avoid hazards and reach the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`) while avoiding being killed by lasers or falling into holes.

The avatar must approach them carefully either from the front to eliminate hazards or from the sides to avoid being killed.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Strategically use boxes and boulders to create barriers against lasers.

It incorporates obstacle navigation and strategic movement, requiring players to manipulate the environment and their character (the avatar) to reach the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites that serve different functions, such as walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals. Each sprite has defined properties and interactions with others.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can manipulate boxes and boulders to interact with other objects (e.g., shields against lasers, killing hazards, etc.).\n  - Certain interactions produce specific outcomes like transforming, stepping back, attracting gaze, or killing sprites upon collision.\n  - The avatar has to navigate through the environment using the properties of the sprites wisely to avoid hazards and reach the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`) while avoiding being killed by lasers or falling into holes. Successfully reaching the goal contributes towards the score, indicating a clear victory condition (win=True if `goal` sprite's counter is at zero).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the `goal` sprite is countered down to zero (indicated by a successful interaction with the avatar).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the `avatar` sprite counter reaches zero, meaning the avatar has been eliminated in some manner (e.g., killed by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understanding Hazards**: Take note of where lasers are located and the direction they face. The avatar must approach them carefully either from the front to eliminate hazards or from the sides to avoid being killed.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Strategically use boxes and boulders to create barriers against lasers.

It incorporates obstacle navigation and strategic movement, requiring players to manipulate the environment and their character (the avatar) to reach the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites that serve different functions, such as walls, holes, boxes, boulders, lasers, and goals. Each sprite has defined properties and interactions with others.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can manipulate boxes and boulders to interact with other objects (e.g., shields against lasers, killing hazards, etc.).\n  - Certain interactions produce specific outcomes like transforming, stepping back, attracting gaze, or killing sprites upon collision.\n  - The avatar has to navigate through the environment using the properties of the sprites wisely to avoid hazards and reach the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the goal (`goal avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`) while avoiding being killed by lasers or falling into holes. Successfully reaching the goal contributes towards the score, indicating a clear victory condition (win=True if `goal` sprite's counter is at zero).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the `goal` sprite is countered down to zero (indicated by a successful interaction with the avatar).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the `avatar` sprite counter reaches zero, meaning the avatar has been eliminated in some manner (e.g., killed by lasers, falling into holes).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understanding Hazards**: Take note of where lasers are located and the direction they face. The avatar must approach them carefully either from the front to eliminate hazards or from the sides to avoid being killed.\n\n2. **Utilizing Boxes and Boulders**: Strategically use boxes and boulders to create barriers against lasers.

Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb.....................%b\nb.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...@.%b\nb...@............b.@..%b\nb..b.bbbbbbbbbb.@.%....b\nb@@b...........bb...b..b\nb..b....@.@....bbb.bbb.b\nb..b.....@.....b&***...b\nb@@b...@.......b&***...b\nb..b...#..b%%%%...@...%b\nb..b......b..........%%b\nb.ab......b.........%%$b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&bbb...*\n*@@*...@.......*&bbb...*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*.a*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nTo progress towards the goal, have the avatar push the adjacent box to clear a path and block the hazards, while being prepared to adapt your strategy immediately if there are any changes in the surrounding obstacles or hazards.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
