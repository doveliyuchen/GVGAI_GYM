The player navigates through a layout filled with obstacles, using specific mechanics to achieve their objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites & Interaction**: The game features various sprite types, including immovable objects (walls, ground, holes, and goals), passive and missile entities (boxes, boulders, and lasers).\n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that interacts with these sprites, with dynamics such as stepping back from collisions and bouncing forward upon contact with boxes.\n- **Laser Mechanic**: The presence of lasercannons introduces a threat to the avatar, as lasers can kill the avatar based on their orientation. They also trigger reactions with other sprites, such as killing the boulders and boxes when combined with specific conditions.\n- **Goal Condition**: The objective for the player is to reach the goal sprite while accumulating score changes based on interactions, explicitly gaining points through specific actions (like interacting with holes).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate to the goal ('g') while avoiding hazards (like lasers and boulders) and manipulating other sprites to facilitate movement or shield against threats. Players accumulate points by utilizing game mechanics to gain score and ultimately achieve the game\u2019s win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by interacting with the goal sprite, which also gives a score bonus. This will be tracked by the SpriteCounter for the goal sprite reaching 0.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the SpriteCounter shows the avatar's count reaching 0 (implying they are out of moves or lives). Various interactions can lead to this, particularly with lasers and holes.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understanding Sprite Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others, especially concerning hazards (lasers and boulders).\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes effectively to shield from frontal lasers and create pathways or obstacles for moving boulders and lasers.\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Use boulders and the 'boulderm' transformation strategically to control movement and mitigate risk by directing hazards away from the avatar.\n4. **Plan Movements**: Movement should be planned to avoid unnecessary backtracking. Use walls and boxes effectively to guide the avatar toward the goal without running into lasers.\n5. **Goal Priority**: Assess the risk of reaching the goal against moving through the puzzle components; prioritize reaching the goal if it presents itself, especially when the score point condition is met.\n\nBy executing strategic movements and carefully planning interactions with sprites, you'll navigate the level effectively, accumulate points, and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

The current position is in the second to last row of the playing area. Analyzing the surrounding area reveals a wall directly to the left, a wall above, and walls on all other sides except for below. To the right (x=2) is a wall, indicating that the avatar is quite constrained in movement options. Framed by walls, the next potential interaction appears to be moving closer to the boulder or hole below.\n\n#### Current Surroundings:\n- Up (y=11, x=1): wall\n- Down (y=13, x=1): wall\n- Left (y=12, x=0): wall\n- Right (y=12, x=2): wall\n- Goal (y=12, x=3): reachable through movement.\n\nThe closest interactable item from the avatar's perspective is the goal ('g') located at (y=12, x=3). The avatar only needs to move right to reach it.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven that the goal is immediately accessible to the avatar's right, the best plan is to approach the gate.\n\n```**approach the goal**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The surrounding environment is as follows:\n\n- **Up (y=11, x=1):** Wall (b)\n- **Down (y=13, x=1):** Wall (b)\n- **Left (y=12, x=0):** Wall (b)\n- **Right (y=12, x=2):** Wall (b)\n- **Goal (y=12, x=3):** Goal ($)\n\nThe avatar is surrounded by walls on three sides and has limited movement. The immediate right (x=2) is also a wall, effectively blocking access to the goal at (x=3). \n\n### Observations\n1. **Restricted Movement**: The avatar cannot move left, right, up, or down, as all surrounding positions are walls. This means that the avatar cannot advance toward the goal in its current state.\n2. **Immediate Goal**: The goal is located to the right of the avatar, but the walls are blocking the path. Thus, the avatar cannot interact with the goal directly.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn the current state, the avatar is unable to move due to the walls surrounding it. Therefore, a strategy that suggests an immediate action to reach the goal is not possible because the avatar is trapped.\n\n### Overall Strategy\nSince no immediate items or pathways are available for interaction, the next correct action is to carefully reassess the surroundings to determine if any actions (like pushing a box or boulder) could be initiated in a future turn to open up pathways or free the avatar. \n\nGiven that no movement is possible at this juncture, the following strategy focuses on observing surroundings for future moves, since the avatar remains stuck.\n\n```**waiting for a shift in the environment or another opportunity to move**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Thus, the avatar cannot perform any actions to progress.\n\n### Strategy\n\nSince the avatar is currently stuck and has no actions available, there is no item to interact with or move toward. The only reasonable option is to await any possible changes beyond this state, but that is not something that can be strategized by the avatar in this position.\n\nWithout any interactable items or movement opportunities, one might consider the next best strategy, which in this case is to recognize the blockade and plan for potential changes if they occur in subsequent states.\n\n```**remain in position and reassess options in future turns**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

The player navigates through a layout filled with obstacles, using specific mechanics to achieve their objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites & Interaction**: The game features various sprite types, including immovable objects (walls, ground, holes, and goals), passive and missile entities (boxes, boulders, and lasers).\n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that interacts with these sprites, with dynamics such as stepping back from collisions and bouncing forward upon contact with boxes.\n- **Laser Mechanic**: The presence of lasercannons introduces a threat to the avatar, as lasers can kill the avatar based on their orientation. They also trigger reactions with other sprites, such as killing the boulders and boxes when combined with specific conditions.\n- **Goal Condition**: The objective for the player is to reach the goal sprite while accumulating score changes based on interactions, explicitly gaining points through specific actions (like interacting with holes).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate to the goal ('g') while avoiding hazards (like lasers and boulders) and manipulating other sprites to facilitate movement or shield against threats. Players accumulate points by utilizing game mechanics to gain score and ultimately achieve the game\u2019s win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by interacting with the goal sprite, which also gives a score bonus. This will be tracked by the SpriteCounter for the goal sprite reaching 0.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the SpriteCounter shows the avatar's count reaching 0 (implying they are out of moves or lives). Various interactions can lead to this, particularly with lasers and holes.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understanding Sprite Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others, especially concerning hazards (lasers and boulders).\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes effectively to shield from frontal lasers and create pathways or obstacles for moving boulders and lasers.\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Use boulders and the 'boulderm' transformation strategically to control movement and mitigate risk by directing hazards away from the avatar.\n4. **Plan Movements**: Movement should be planned to avoid unnecessary backtracking. Use walls and boxes effectively to guide the avatar toward the goal without running into lasers.\n5. **Goal Priority**: Assess the risk of reaching the goal against moving through the puzzle components; prioritize reaching the goal if it presents itself, especially when the score point condition is met.\n\nBy executing strategic movements and carefully planning interactions with sprites, you'll navigate the level effectively, accumulate points, and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM.

The left, up, right, and down are all occupied by walls, which prevents the avatar from moving in any direction.\n   \n2. **Goal Proximity**: The goal is located immediately to the right of the avatar (x=3), but there is a wall at (x=2) blocking the way. Therefore, the goal is unreachable at this time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the avatar\u2019s position, no actions can be performed; the avatar cannot move closer to the goal or interact with any items. The situation is static.\n\n### Strategy\n\nSince the avatar cannot perform any movement or interact with any items, the strategy must account for the immediate inability to act. The best approach in this scenario is to acknowledge the immediate situation. As there's a complete blockage, there's no option but to remain in the current position until a movement opportunity presents itself.\n\nDue to the walls limiting any options and since the state of the game does not permit any action, the only reasonable strategy for the avatar is to remain where it is and wait for any future changes that could enable movement.\n\n```**remain stationary and await future movement opportunities**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

Various interactions can lead to this, particularly with lasers and holes.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understanding Sprite Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with others, especially concerning hazards (lasers and boulders).\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes effectively to shield from frontal lasers and create pathways or obstacles for moving boulders and lasers.\n3. **Manipulate Boulders**: Use boulders and the 'boulderm' transformation strategically to control movement and mitigate risk by directing hazards away from the avatar.\n4. **Plan Movements**: Movement should be planned to avoid unnecessary backtracking. Use walls and boxes effectively to guide the avatar toward the goal without running into lasers.\n5. **Goal Priority**: Assess the risk of reaching the goal against moving through the puzzle components; prioritize reaching the goal if it presents itself, especially when the score point condition is met.\n\nBy executing strategic movements and carefully planning interactions with sprites, you'll navigate the level effectively, accumulate points, and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy, DONT TRUST HIM. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesnt change from the last state, you need to analysis the state again.Always try to locate and interact with the nearest item relevant to the current strategy. If such an item is not available, instead identify the nearest interactable item in the game state.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nlcright lright -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nlright -> 'b'\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*a.*\n*%%..........*......*..*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*$%%.........*......*a.*\n*%%..........*......*..*\n*%...@...%%%%*..#...*..*\n*.....b&*.......@...*@@*\n*.....b&*.....@.....*..*\n*.***.***....@.@....*..*\n*..*...**...........*@@*\n*....%.@.**********.*..*\n*%..@.*............@...*\n*%.@...***************.*\n*%.....................*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Avatar Position ===\n(y=11, x=2)\n=== Last Position ===\n(y=11, x=2)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### Game Analysis\n\nThe avatar 'a' is currently positioned at (y=12, x=1). The surrounding environment is as follows:\n\n- **Up (y=11, x=1)**: Wall (b)\n- **Down (y=13, x=1)**: Wall (b)\n- **Left (y=12, x=0)**: Wall (b)\n- **Right (y=12, x=2)**: Wall (b)\n- **Goal (y=12, x=3)**: Goal ($)\n\n### Observations\n\n1. **Trapped Position**: The avatar is completely trapped; walls surround it in every direction. There are no valid moves available, and consequently, reaching the goal (which is located at (y=12, x=3)) is currently impossible due to the wall at (x=2).\n\n2. **No Interactable Items**: Since the avatar cannot move at all, there are no items to interact with. This renders any strategy involving movement or item manipulation infeasible at the moment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the complete blockage surrounding the avatar and the lack of any interactions or options available, the state of the game is static, and the avatar cannot take any action.\n\n### Strategy\n\nIn this scenario of being trapped with no possible options, the avatar has no actions to execute. The strategy thus needs to acknowledge this inability to act. \n\nSince the environment doesn\u2019t allow for any interactions or movement, the best high-level strategy for the avatar is to simply recognize its current position and the situation.\n\n```**acknowledge the complete blockage and remain in position, as no actions can be taken**```\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy.",
