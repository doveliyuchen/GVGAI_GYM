    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules and interactions, the game appears to fall under the genre of *puzzle-platformer*. It combines platforming movement mechanics with strategic placement and interaction of different sprites to solve puzzles and reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game contains various sprites, including obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes, and holes), the player character (avatar), and missiles (lasers). Each sprite has its own behavior and interaction rules.\n  \n- **Movement**: The player can move the avatar around the environment, primarily interacting with other sprites like boxes and obstacles.\n  \n- **Interactions**: Interaction rules dictate how different sprites respond upon contact. For example, pushing a box can shield the avatar from laser attacks, and falling into a hole results in the death of both the avatar and the boulderm.\n\n- **Missiles**: Lasers act as a form of attack that can kill sprites based on their orientation relative to the avatar (killIfFrontal and killIfNotFrontal). \n\n- **Transformation Mechanics**: The presence of interactions that can transform sprites (e.g., boulders to boulderm) indicates a complex strategy revolving around manipulating the environment.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to have the avatar reach the goal (indicated by \"g\") while avoiding death from various hazards (e.g., lasers and holes). Upon reaching the goal, the player receives a score increase, which suggests that achieving the goal is the ultimate aim.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if there are no instances of the goal sprite remaining. Successfully moving the avatar to the goal and not dying contributes to this condition.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has died based on interactions with lasers, boulders, or falling into holes.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Safe Path Planning**: Map out a safe route to the goal. Given the game's obstacles and threats, players should identify safe paths that minimize exposure to lasers and holes.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Boxes can be used to block laser attacks. Position them wisely to create safe passages for the avatar to move without risk.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulder and Boulderm Interactions**: Utilize the transformation and interaction mechanics of boulders and the boulderm to clear paths or manipulate hazards to your advantage.\n\n4. **Experiment with Obstacles**: Players should explore different interactions with walls and lasers to understand how to navigate the levels effectively. For example, checking how boulders interact with walls and each other can reveal alternate pathways.\n\n5. **Conservative Movement**: Move cautiously, particularly in areas close to hazards. The game mechanics suggest that sticking too close to dangerous sprites without proper planning can lead to rapid loss of the avatar.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to not only reach the goal but do so while maximizing the score by engaging in actions that yield points (like causing interactions that yield score changes).\n\nThrough careful planning and strategic maneuvers, players should be able to navigate the level effectively and achieve the goals while minimizing risks from various environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Upon reaching the goal, the player receives a score increase, which suggests that achieving the goal is the ultimate aim.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if there are no instances of the goal sprite remaining. Successfully moving the avatar to the goal and not dying contributes to this condition.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has died based on interactions with lasers, boulders, or falling into holes.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Safe Path Planning**: Map out a safe route to the goal. Given the game's obstacles and threats, players should identify safe paths that minimize exposure to lasers and holes.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Boxes can be used to block laser attacks. Position them wisely to create safe passages for the avatar to move without risk.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulder and Boulderm Interactions**: Utilize the transformation and interaction mechanics of boulders and the boulderm to clear paths or manipulate hazards to your advantage.\n\n4. **Experiment with Obstacles**: Players should explore different interactions with walls and lasers to understand how to navigate the levels effectively. For example, checking how boulders interact with walls and each other can reveal alternate pathways.\n\n5. **Conservative Movement**: Move cautiously, particularly in areas close to hazards. The game mechanics suggest that sticking too close to dangerous sprites without proper planning can lead to rapid loss of the avatar.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to not only reach the goal but do so while maximizing the score by engaging in actions that yield points (like causing interactions that yield score changes).\n\nThrough careful planning and strategic maneuvers, players should be able to navigate the level effectively and achieve the goals while minimizing risks from various environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Successfully moving the avatar to the goal and not dying contributes to this condition.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has died based on interactions with lasers, boulders, or falling into holes.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Safe Path Planning**: Map out a safe route to the goal. Given the game's obstacles and threats, players should identify safe paths that minimize exposure to lasers and holes.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Boxes can be used to block laser attacks. Position them wisely to create safe passages for the avatar to move without risk.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulder and Boulderm Interactions**: Utilize the transformation and interaction mechanics of boulders and the boulderm to clear paths or manipulate hazards to your advantage.\n\n4. **Experiment with Obstacles**: Players should explore different interactions with walls and lasers to understand how to navigate the levels effectively. For example, checking how boulders interact with walls and each other can reveal alternate pathways.\n\n5. **Conservative Movement**: Move cautiously, particularly in areas close to hazards. The game mechanics suggest that sticking too close to dangerous sprites without proper planning can lead to rapid loss of the avatar.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to not only reach the goal but do so while maximizing the score by engaging in actions that yield points (like causing interactions that yield score changes).\n\nThrough careful planning and strategic maneuvers, players should be able to navigate the level effectively and achieve the goals while minimizing risks from various environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

Given the game's obstacles and threats, players should identify safe paths that minimize exposure to lasers and holes.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Boxes can be used to block laser attacks. Position them wisely to create safe passages for the avatar to move without risk.\n\n3. **Manipulate Boulder and Boulderm Interactions**: Utilize the transformation and interaction mechanics of boulders and the boulderm to clear paths or manipulate hazards to your advantage.\n\n4. **Experiment with Obstacles**: Players should explore different interactions with walls and lasers to understand how to navigate the levels effectively. For example, checking how boulders interact with walls and each other can reveal alternate pathways.\n\n5. **Conservative Movement**: Move cautiously, particularly in areas close to hazards. The game mechanics suggest that sticking too close to dangerous sprites without proper planning can lead to rapid loss of the avatar.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to not only reach the goal but do so while maximizing the score by engaging in actions that yield points (like causing interactions that yield score changes).\n\nThrough careful planning and strategic maneuvers, players should be able to navigate the level effectively and achieve the goals while minimizing risks from various environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

It combines platforming movement mechanics with strategic placement and interaction of different sprites to solve puzzles and reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game contains various sprites, including obstacles (walls, boulders, boxes, and holes), the player character (avatar), and missiles (lasers). Each sprite has its own behavior and interaction rules.\n  \n- **Movement**: The player can move the avatar around the environment, primarily interacting with other sprites like boxes and obstacles.\n  \n- **Interactions**: Interaction rules dictate how different sprites respond upon contact. For example, pushing a box can shield the avatar from laser attacks, and falling into a hole results in the death of both the avatar and the boulderm.\n\n- **Missiles**: Lasers act as a form of attack that can kill sprites based on their orientation relative to the avatar (killIfFrontal and killIfNotFrontal). \n\n- **Transformation Mechanics**: The presence of interactions that can transform sprites (e.g., boulders to boulderm) indicates a complex strategy revolving around manipulating the environment.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to have the avatar reach the goal (indicated by \"g\") while avoiding death from various hazards (e.g., lasers and holes). Upon reaching the goal, the player receives a score increase, which suggests that achieving the goal is the ultimate aim.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if there are no instances of the goal sprite remaining. Successfully moving the avatar to the goal and not dying contributes to this condition.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has died based on interactions with lasers, boulders, or falling into holes.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Safe Path Planning**: Map out a safe route to the goal. Given the game's obstacles and threats, players should identify safe paths that minimize exposure to lasers and holes.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Boxes can be used to block laser attacks.
