This conclusion is drawn from the interaction of various sprite types (like blocks and boulders) alongside a character (the avatar) navigating through a level with obstacles and enemies.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game incorporates various types of sprites such as immovable walls, movable boulders and boxes, a goal, and hazards like lasers.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, and other sprites. Movement seems to be constrained by walls and various objects.\n   - **Combat Mechanics**: Certain interactions allow the avatar to be turned into a boulderm (indicating a transformation under certain conditions) or shield from lasers by using boxes.\n   - **Scoring System**: Players are rewarded with points for specific interactions, particularly those involving reaching the goal.\n   - **Environmental Hazards**: Lasers and holes present lethal components, creating a challenge that the player must navigate.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objectives appear to be:\n- To reach the **goal** sprite, which grants points and potentially ends the level.\n- To avoid hazards such as lasers and holes, which can kill the avatar.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is no longer present (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Careful Navigation**: Players must plan movements carefully to avoid collision with walls and hazards like lasers or holes.

Understanding how to trigger interactions leading to advantageous transformations will be crucial.\n\n4. **Route Planning**: Analyze the level layout for the shortest and safest path to the goal, avoiding potential traps and ensuring that each move is strategically sound (e.g., bouncing off boxes to navigate more safely).\n\n5. **Timing is Key**: If any hazards have a timing aspect (e.g., moving lasers), players should learn their patterns and time their movements accordingly\u2014not rushing toward the goal without a plan can lead to quick deaths.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and understanding the game\u2019s mechanics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating each level, achieving higher scores, and ultimately completing the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy.

This will allow the avatar to explore new paths while not retracing movements that have not yet yielded a change in position.\n\n### Selected Action\n```Action:3```\n\nThis action will open up new opportunities for exploration and interactions while keeping in line with the strategy of finding new pathways to approach the goal and navigate effectively through the level. I anticipate that this movement could reveal new functional sprites or avoid obstacles.",

    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze various aspects of the game including its genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and strategies.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the genre of **puzzle-platformer**. This conclusion is drawn from the interaction of various sprite types (like blocks and boulders) alongside a character (the avatar) navigating through a level with obstacles and enemies.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game incorporates various types of sprites such as immovable walls, movable boulders and boxes, a goal, and hazards like lasers.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can interact with walls, boxes, and other sprites. Movement seems to be constrained by walls and various objects.\n   - **Combat Mechanics**: Certain interactions allow the avatar to be turned into a boulderm (indicating a transformation under certain conditions) or shield from lasers by using boxes.\n   - **Scoring System**: Players are rewarded with points for specific interactions, particularly those involving reaching the goal.\n   - **Environmental Hazards**: Lasers and holes present lethal components, creating a challenge that the player must navigate.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objectives appear to be:\n- To reach the **goal** sprite, which grants points and potentially ends the level.\n- To avoid hazards such as lasers and holes, which can kill the avatar.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal sprite, resulting in a score change of 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is no longer present (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Careful Navigation**: Players must plan movements carefully to avoid collision with walls and hazards like lasers or holes. Knowing the avatar's interactions with various objects, such as boxes and boulders, is essential for progressing through the level.\n  \n2. **Use of Shielding**: Utilize boxes to shield from frontal lasers, allowing safe passage when moving towards the goal.\n\n3. **Manipulating Environment**: Players can take advantage of the boulders and boxes by using them to create paths or shielding from dangers. Understanding how to trigger interactions leading to advantageous transformations will be crucial.\n\n4. **Route Planning**: Analyze the level layout for the shortest and safest path to the goal, avoiding potential traps and ensuring that each move is strategically sound (e.g., bouncing off boxes to navigate more safely).\n\n5. **Timing is Key**: If any hazards have a timing aspect (e.g., moving lasers), players should learn their patterns and time their movements accordingly\u2014not rushing toward the goal without a plan can lead to quick deaths.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and understanding the game\u2019s mechanics, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating each level, achieving higher scores, and ultimately completing the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Last State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Current State ===\n************************\n*.....................%*\n*.***************...@.%*\n*...@............*.@..%*\n*..*.**********.@.%....*\n*@@*...........**...*..*\n*..*....@.@....***.***.*\n*..*.....@.....*&hhhhhh*\n*@@*...@.......*&hhhhhh*\n*..*...#..*%%%%...@...%*\n*..*......*..........%%*\n*a.*......*.........%%$*\n************************\n\n=== Last Reward ===\n0.0\n\n=== Current Position ===\n(Left is decreasing x, Right is increasing x, Up is decreasing y, Down is increasing y)\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n=== Last Position ===\n(row = 11, col = 1)\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n \n**Interact with the 'hhhhhh' item at (3, 9) to explore its potential benefits for advancing towards the goal.**\n\n\n\nPlease locate the item, then choose an action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```.

    "content": "Your avatar is at position (row = 11, col = 1), and there's been no movement from the last action taken, which indicates that I need to choose a different action to proceed.\n\nThe overarching goal remains to get closer to the 'hhhhhh' items located at (row = 11, col = 6) and (row = 11, col = 7). Since the last actions haven't led to a successful change in position and exploring different paths is crucial, I will now choose to **move UP** to (row = 10, col = 1). This will allow for exploring new vertical pathways, which could be advantageous.\n\n### Selected Action\n```Action:4```\n\nThis action will allow the avatar to potentially find new opportunities and moves while maintaining the strategy of exploring various movement directions. I expect this change will reveal new contexts and could provide necessary advantages in pursuing the goal effectively.",
