The player controls a submarine ('avatar') that interacts with various aquatic lifeforms and resources in an underwater environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- The player controls a submarine (the avatar) that can shoot torpedoes to eliminate fish and avoid or deal with predators like sharks, whales, and piranhas.\n- The environment features immovable obstacles (water), spawning points (holes), and collectible resources (shells and shark fangs).\n- Players gain points by collecting resources and scoring through interactions with specific sprites like whales and piranhas.\n- There are cooldowns for enemy spawn points, which add a layer of strategy regarding when to attack or retreat.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to survive against the various aquatic enemies while maximizing the collection of resources. Players aim to score points by collecting shark fangs and shells, while also managing their interaction with the predators effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- The game is won if the player survives until the timeout limit (1000 units of time).  \n- The player loses if their avatar sprite count reaches zero (i.e., the player loses all lives).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**  \n\n1. **Resource Management:** Focus on collecting shells first, as they provide a minor score and can facilitate encounters with the shark (by spawning resources). Collect the more valuable shark fangs when possible to maximize score.\n\n2. **Avoiding Predators:** Maintain distance from threats like sharks, whales, and piranhas as they can kill the avatar. Use torpedoes to eliminate smaller threats (fish) and deal with larger threats strategically with careful movement.\n\n3. **Timing and Positioning:** Pay attention to when and where predators spawn. Avoid engaging them head-on unless you have sufficient resources (shells) to back yourself up. Utilize the spawning of whirlpools wisely to keep track of potential enemy movements.\n\n4. **Utilize Cooldowns:** Be aware of the spawning and cooldown times for enemies like whales and piranhas. If you kill one, retreat for a moment to allow a cooldown. This can give you time to regroup and continue collecting resources.\n\n5. **Plan Your Attacks:** Launch torpedoes strategically, aiming to eliminate fish first to gain resources and clear paths. This will allow for easier navigation and reduce the overall threat in your vicinity. \n\n6. **Keep Track of your Resources:** Always be aware of how many shells you have. Engaging a shark should depend on having enough shells collected, as losing the encounter due to insufficient resources can lead to an immediate loss.\n\n7. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities:** Whenever you encounter a whale or piranha, shoot them with torpedoes, as they transform into shells that provide scoring opportunities. \n\nBy combining careful maneuvering, resource management, and strategic engagements, players can maximize their chances of surviving and scoring high in this underwater environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater piranhahole -> '1'\nwater whalehole -> '2'\nwater sharkhole -> '3'\nwater -> '.'\npiranhahole water -> '@'\nsharkhole water -> '#'\npiranha piranhahole water -> '$'\npiranha water -> '%'\nwater whale whalehole -> '&'\nwater whale -> '*'\nshark water -> 'p'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=0, col=16 -> .\nrow=0, col=17 -> .\nrow=0, col=18 -> .\nrow=0, col=19 -> .\nrow=0, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> .\nrow=2, col=20 -> @\nrow=3, col=0 -> 2\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=19 -> %\nrow=4, col=20 -> @\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> a\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> p\nrow=6, col=7 -> p\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> .\nrow=6, col=20 -> @\nrow=7, col=0 -> 2\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> p\nrow=7, col=7 -> p\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> .\nrow=7, col=20 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> .\nrow=8, col=19 -> .\nrow=8, col=20 -> .",
