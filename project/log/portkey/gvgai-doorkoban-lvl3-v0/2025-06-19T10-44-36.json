It combines elements of spatial reasoning (moving blocks) within a confined environment (the level layout), and features an objective-oriented design with win/loss conditions.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites/Character Types:**\n  - **Avatar:** The player's character that can move and interact with various objects.\n  - **Boxes:** Passive objects that can be moved or interacted with to trigger events.\n  - **Holes:** Locations where boxes can be placed, potentially leading to scoring.\n  - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that the avatar cannot move through.\n  - **Doors:** Can be closed or open, serving as objectives for progression.\n  - **Exit:** The final goal to achieve, represented as an open door, signaling the end of the level.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes and is impeded by walls and closed doors.\n  - Placing boxes into specific holes leads to score changes and potentially kills related sprites (indicating a gameplay mechanic where certain actions may end or remove other elements).\n  - The exit interaction leads to a score change and signifies a win condition.\n\n- **Termination Conditions:**\n  - The game can end in two ways:\n    1. **Victory:** Achieving the exit by satisfying the sprite conditions (when the exit sprite count reaches 0).\n    2. **Loss:** Running out of time (timeout limit of 1000 units).\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar through the level, managing boxes to interact with holes and ultimately reach the exit. Players must solve the spatial puzzles posed by the arrangement of boxes and gates to effectively interact with the holes and escape the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully navigate to the exit after the required interactions with the boxes and holes.\n- **Loss Condition:** Failing to reach the exit before the timer runs out.\n\n**Strategy Suggestion:**\n1. **Plan Movements:** Before acting, analyze the arrangement of boxes, holes, and exits. Identify how many boxes are needed for each hole and calculate potential score gains.\n  \n2. **Box Management:** Move boxes systematically towards their corresponding holes while paying attention to possible bounces and recoil that the avatar might experience. Ensure boxes are placed in a way that allows you to easily reach each hole.\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles:** Be mindful of walls and the timing of your movements, as getting stuck or repeatedly bouncing against walls can waste valuable time.\n\n4. **Time Efficiency:** As there's a strict time limit, maintain an efficient route. Avoid unnecessary interactions that do not contribute to meeting the win conditions.\n\n5. **Maximize Scores:** Whenever possible, prioritize placing boxes in the holes that yield higher score changes before heading to the exit.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of completing the level successfully within the time limits while maximizing their score in the process.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> h\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> a\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> e\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> w\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> c\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> f\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> %\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

This aligns with the strategy of clear movement towards the goal.",
