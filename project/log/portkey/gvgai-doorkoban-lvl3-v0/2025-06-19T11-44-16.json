The presence of an avatar that moves, interacts with various objects (boxes, walls, doors), and has goals typically suggests puzzle-solving mechanics often found in this genre.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes**: Passive elements that can interact with both the avatar and the environment.\n   - **Walls and Doors**: Impassable barriers that provide structure to the game.\n   - **Holes**: Special objects that can lead to changing states (e.g., killing other sprites).\n   - **Exit**: Points scored and the primary goal of the game.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes and cannot pass through walls or closed doors.\n   - Boxes can trigger various outcomes when they interact with holes (resulting in kills and score changes).\n   - There is a scoring system based on which box falls into which hole.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - Winning occurs when the exit sprite is cleared from the level.\n   - Losing occurs if the player runs out of time.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary aim is to remove the exit sprite by manipulating the boxes into the corresponding holes.\n- Each box corresponds to a different hole and will yield varying score changes based on which box lands in which hole.\n- The ultimate goal is to maximize the score while achieving the win condition by clearing the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the exit sprite is no longer present in the level. \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if time runs out (indicated by the timeout limit).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Moves**: Focus on moving boxes into holes that give the best score potential first. For example, aim to get box3 into hole3 for a score change of 8 before other boxes.\n\n2. **Plan Your Path**: Map out a path where the avatar can effectively push boxes without getting stuck by walls or closed doors. Ensure that movements consider both the boxes and future interactions with holes.\n\n3. **Optimize Interactions**: Use the ability of boxes to kill other sprites strategically. Whenever possible, choose interactions that maximize score while clearing obstacles.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep track of the time remaining in the game. Make sure each action counts, especially when nearing the timeout limit.\n\n5. **Experiment & Iterate**: If an interaction doesn't yield the expected outcome, don\u2019t hesitate to restart or rethink. Solving puzzles often requires trial-and-error and adapting to the game state.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, players should focus on understanding how to manipulate the boxes effectively, managing interactions, and maximizing score while navigating the constraints of the environment and the ticking clock.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> h\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> e\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> w\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> c\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> f\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> %\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

I expect to find more room to navigate toward the nearby boxes or execute further actions.",
