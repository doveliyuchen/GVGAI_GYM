Players navigate a character through a grid-based level, solving challenges and utilizing mechanics to progress.\n\n### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different elements:\n  - **Floor**: An immovable ground layer where the avatar can walk.\n  - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n  - **Boxes**: Passive objects that can interact with the avatar and other objects.\n  - **Holes**: Special areas that facilitate certain interactions and can be used to dispose of boxes.\n  - **Doors**: These serve as entry points, some of which are closed and can be opened through specific interactions.\n  - **Exit**: Marks the end of the level that can be reached for victory.\n  - **Walls**: Immoveable barriers that guide the player's movements.\n\n- **Interactions**: These involve the avatar and other elements:\n  - The avatar can push boxes and interact with walls and doors.\n  - Boxes can interact with holes, leading to various outcomes including scoring based on which box is used.\n  - Completing actions generally leads to an increase in score, which suggests a strategic aspect to choosing which boxes to use.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The main goal is to manipulate boxes into holes to score points and ultimately reach the exit door.\n- Each hole has a different scoring potential depending on the specific box used (from 1 to 8).\n- Reaching the exit while managing the active game timer is also necessary for victory.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Conditions**: \n  - You win if you manage to reach the exit (`exit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=16`) while ensuring the limit for the exit sprite counter reaches zero.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - You lose if the timeout limit exceeds before achieving the win condition.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Box Management**: Prioritize utilizing boxes in the correct sequence to maximize points. Start from the box with the highest score impact (box3) and work your way down.\n  \n2. **Optimization of Movement**: Minimize movement to adjust boxes without colliding with walls or each other unnecessarily. Be smart about pushing boxes into holes to avoid blocking paths.\n\n3. **Timing**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Plan moves efficiently to ensure you can maneuver to the exit before time runs out.\n\n4. **Use of Space**: Take advantage of the wall layout to ensure that the avatar can access holes without getting trapped or backtracking unnecessarily.\n\n5. **Progress on Multiple Paths**: If the layout provides alternate routes, analyze and choose paths that may allow for critical box placement or better movements towards the exit.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Since this is a puzzle game, some trial and error with box placement may be beneficial to finding the most effective sequence of moves.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics, players can navigate the challenges effectively and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> h\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=13 -> e\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> w\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=13 -> w\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> c\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> f\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> %\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

    "content": "Given the layout of the current state and your avatar's position at **(row=5, col=4)**, let's analyze the situation:\n\n### Surrounding Elements:\n- Any available movement for the avatar must be through '.' (floor) or a box ('@', '#', '$', '%') that the avatar can manipulate.\n- The immediate surroundings show:\n  - Row 5: (row=5, col=3) is '.' and (row=5, col=5) is '.'.\n  - Row **6**: (row=6, col=4) has '&' (door), but it appears blocked by walls.\n\n### Observations and Moves:\n- Moving **left (to (row=5, col=3))** or moving **right (to (row=5, col=5))** would be possible.\n- If I consider box management, there are boxes to the north at (row=6, col=11) which would not influence my immediate move.\n- The cached actions state clearly indicates that no movement has occurred from the last state.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo maximize points by pushing boxes into holes, it's advisable to ensure I can interact with the boxes effectively. However, immediate boxes are several rows above and to the right. Thus, I should first reposition my avatar.\n\n### Action Choice:\nSince I can move to either direction, I will proceed to move right to (row=5, col=5). This allows me to evaluate the next set of movements more effectively.\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\n\n### Feedback:\nMoving right provides another option for future moves towards empty squares, and I expect to see if we can access more boxes after repositioning, to maintain strategic control towards achieving my objectives.",
