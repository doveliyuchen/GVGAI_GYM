It incorporates combat mechanics and the collection of items or resources.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - Players control an 'avatar' (submarine) that can fire 'torpedoes' at fish and enemy sprites (sharks, whales, piranhas).\n  - There are various environmental features such as 'holes' (whirlpool portals) and immovable water sprites.\n  - The game includes resource collection mechanics, with items like 'shells' and 'sharkFangs' that provide score points and may impact gameplay positively.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Different sprite interactions indicate a system where players can destroy enemies or transform resources into points. For example, using torpedoes against fish kills them and converts them into score points.\n  - Collecting specific resources (like 'sharkFang') gives significant score boosts, indicating a strategic focus on resource management.\n  \n- **Spawn and Combat Dynamics:**\n  - Certain enemies (e.g., sharks, whales, and piranhas) respond differently to the player's actions, creating a dynamic combat experience where positioning and timing are key.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal of the game is to survive for a set amount of time (until the timeout limit of 1000 is reached) while maximizing score through resource collection and defeating enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins if they survive the full duration (timeout) without being eliminated.\n- The game results in a loss if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the player has lost all lives or resources.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Focus on collecting 'shells' and 'sharkFangs' for maximizing your score. Since 'sharkFangs' yield high scores, prioritize any interactions that lead to their acquisition.\n\n2. **Combat Positioning:**\n   - Maintain distance from enemy sprites, particularly sharks, unless you have sufficient resources to defend yourself. Use torpedoes judiciously against fish while avoiding direct confrontations with larger enemies unless necessary.\n\n3. **Timing of Attacks:**\n   - Plan your attacks based on enemy cooldowns (whales and piranhas have an ability cooldown). Use the time they are vulnerable to collect resources or reposition effectively.\n\n4. **Avoiding Loss Conditions:**\n   - Monitor your resources carefully. If you acquire less than 15 'shells,' be cautious when near sharks to avoid getting killed. If at risk, retreat to a safer spot, utilizing the movement mechanics available.\n\n5. **Utilizing the Environment:**\n   - Take advantage of the layout, using spaces to create distance from threats or to engage in strategic retreats when necessary.\n\nBy focusing on effective resource collection and careful combat engagement, players can maximize their scores while successfully navigating threats to their avatar's survival.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater piranhahole -> '1'\nwater whalehole -> '2'\nwater sharkhole -> '3'\nwater -> '.'\npiranha piranhahole water -> '@'\npiranhahole water -> '#'\nsharkhole water -> '$'\npiranha water -> '%'\ntorpedo water -> '&'\nshark water -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=0, col=16 -> .\nrow=0, col=17 -> .\nrow=0, col=18 -> .\nrow=0, col=19 -> .\nrow=0, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> .\nrow=2, col=20 -> #\nrow=3, col=0 -> .\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> %\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> %\nrow=3, col=20 -> #\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> .\nrow=4, col=20 -> #\nrow=5, col=0 -> .\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> %\nrow=5, col=20 -> #\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> .\nrow=6, col=20 -> #\nrow=7, col=0 -> .\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> %\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> .\nrow=7, col=20 -> #\nrow=8, col=0 -> a\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> .\nrow=8, col=19 -> .\nrow=8, col=20 -> .",

Since my avatar is positioned right next to a shark, it is crucial to avoid unnecessary confrontation as I currently do not have information about my health or available resources.\n\n### Assessing the Current Situation:\n- The shark could potentially attack if I stay near it.\n- It's important to reposition quickly to ensure my survival while maximizing score opportunities from resource collection.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Confrontation:** Since I am too close to a shark, I should move away to get some distance.\n2. **Explore for Resources:** Movement towards unexplored areas may yield shells and other resources that are necessary for my score.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move **Left** (though (7, 0) is currently empty), to create distance from the shark at (8, 1), understanding that the immediate threat is proximity to a potentially aggressive enemy.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should help me gain distance from the shark, allowing for safer navigation and resource collection in subsequent moves.",
