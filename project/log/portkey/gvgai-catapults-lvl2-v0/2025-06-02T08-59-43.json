    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis that includes the game genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy. \n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-adventure** type, with elements of strategy and exploration. Players interact with various game sprites and navigate through a maze-like environment, utilizing items and overcoming obstacles.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are multiple types of sprites including:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Such as walls, goals, and water.\n   - **Movable Sprites**: Represented by the avatar and bullets.\n   - **Orientation-Based Sprites**: The gameplay involves changing the avatar's orientation using the direction sprites (northfacing, southfacing, etc.).\n   - **Interaction Mechanism**: The avatar interacts with sprites (for instance, transforming into a specific direction, or being killed by water).\n\n2. **Movement**: The avatar can face different directions and can be transformed based on interactions, which likely affects how the player navigates through the level.\n\n3. **Goal**: The ultimate goal is to reach a 'goal' sprite, which is marked as a portal.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to a designated 'goal' sprite while possibly avoiding hazards (like the water) and using the catapult strategically.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all 'goal' sprites are interacted with, reducing their count to zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar count reaches zero, meaning the player can no longer continue.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Gain an understanding of the level layout. Recognize hazards (like water) and obstacles (walls) that may block your path. \n\n2. **Use the Catapult**: The catapult seems crucial as it can eliminate the avatar, which may need to be managed wisely to prevent premature loss.\n\n3. **Manage Orientation**: Keep track of the avatar's facing direction. Transforming the avatar to face in useful directions will be key to navigating the obstacles effectively.\n\n4. **Movement Management**: Avoid moving into water (which kills the avatar) and walls (which will push the avatar back). Trying to create advantageous paths and utilizing the catapult effectively may be beneficial.\n\n5. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks**: Be strategic in interacting with the elements (walls, water) to preserve the avatar count and optimize paths to the goal.\n\n6. **Goal Prioritization**: Identify the closest and easiest 'goal' sprites to reach and attempt to prioritize these while progressing through the level.\n\nIn summary, players will need to navigate through the level, manage their sprite orientations, utilize the catapult judiciously, and avoid hazards to ensure the avatar's survival while achieving the level objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "Given the current state of the map, I will interpret the layout and the positioning of the avatar to determine the best move.\n\n### Analyzing the Current State:\n- The avatar appears to be fixed in position next to a wall (as walls are represented by '*').\n- Surrounding the avatar are mostly walls or the water floor ('.' and 'e'), suggesting limited movement options.\n- The location of potential goals can be observed: 'g' is at (row 4, col 6) and (row 14, col 14).\n- The nearest 'goal' (g) is at (row 13, col 7).\n\n### Strategic Move:\nSince the avatar is currently unable to move due to being adjacent to walls and no direct pathway to the goals, the next logical action would be to try and rotate and face a different direction. However, first I will explore to see if there's a way to step back considering I initially have not seen any movement.\n\nSince the avatar cannot move, I will attempt to first rotate and then try moving downwards if there are no walls blocking that direction.\n\n### Action Selection:\n- Trying to move DOWN could allow repositioning towards more open spaces, as the row below has multiple '.' spaces.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis move aims to create more space and analyze the next available options strategically. My expectation is to find a pathway that allows clearing obstacles for movement towards the goal.",
