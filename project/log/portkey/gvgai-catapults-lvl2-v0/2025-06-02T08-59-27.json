    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the description and elements in the game rules, this appears to be a **puzzle or strategy game**. The presence of sprites such as walls, a catapult, and an avatar suggests that spatial reasoning and planned movements are crucial to gameplay.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes several types of sprites (objects), including immovable elements (walls, water, floor) and interactive sprites (avatar, bullet, catapult).\n- **Movement & Directions**: The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west) and can interact with the environment based upon its orientation.\n- **Interactions**: Various interactions dictate how the avatar can move or change state in relation to objects. For instance, interacting with the catapult eliminates the avatar but may score points. The avatar can also transform its facing direction based on interactions which adds a layer of strategy.\n- **Goal**: The primary goal is to ensure that the avatar reaches the goal sprite (green door), while managing and surviving interactions with other sprites.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the goal while preventing the avatar's elimination by either water or the catapult. Overcoming obstacles and using valid movements to reach the goal is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Achieve the goal while ensuring there are no remaining avatar sprites on the board (SpriteCounter for goal limit set to 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar count reaches zero, the player loses (SpriteCounter for avatar limit set to 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Understand the layout of the level thoroughly. Knowing where obstacles (walls, water) and strategic points (catapults, potential movement areas) are located will help in formulating a move plan.\n\n2. **Avoid Water**: Water is lethal to the avatar. Plan moves carefully with a strategy that avoids these areas, using walls for cover if needed.\n\n3. **Directional Changes**: Use the directional sprites to your advantage. Effectively change the avatar's orientation to move in the desired directions while approaching the goal.\n\n4. **Utilize the Catapult**: If possible, leverage the catapult strategically. It can eliminate the avatar, but also score points. Understand how to use it in scenarios where you can benefit from eliminating other obstacles or if it creates a pathway.\n\n5. **Plan Multimove Outcomes**: Sometimes direct paths may not be the best option. Think a few steps ahead to anticipate interactions with walls and movement spaces, ensuring you\u2019re always on the path toward the goal.\n\n6. **Practice Patience**: Rushing can lead to mistakes. Take your time to consider each move. The puzzle nature of the game might require multiple attempts to perfect a route.\n\nBy applying these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating to the goal while managing the various types of interactions present in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
