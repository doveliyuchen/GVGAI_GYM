It involves strategic movements and possibly problem-solving elements with various sprites leading to different interactions.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites and Orientation:** The game includes various elements like walls, water, a catapult, and an avatar that can change orientation (north, south, east, west). The different orientations may dictate the avatar's movement direction.\n  \n- **Interactions:** The interactions guide how sprites react to one another:\n  - **Avatar Movements:** The avatar transforms to a direction sprite based on its facing orientation. The catapult interacts with the avatar, impacting the gameplay by allowing for movement or possible elimination.\n  - **Destruction and Impact:** Certain interactions can lead to the destruction of the avatar or goals. For example, encountering water leads to \u201ckilling\u201d the sprite, while a bullet can cause walls to transform.\n  \n- **Goal and Scoring:** The primary goal is to reach the goal sprite, represented as a green door. Each time the avatar is killed, the score is adjusted negatively, indicating high stakes for survival.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe objective is to navigate the avatar through the level layout to reach the goal sprite while managing the threats posed by walls and water. Navigating the catapult may be crucial for gaining advantageous positions or enabling further movement.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no remaining goal sprites. \n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:** Study the level layout to plan the route towards the goal effectively. Identify safe zones where the avatar can avoid hazards like water.\n\n2. **Use Catapult Strategically:** Make use of the catapult to propel the avatar orTo store vision on the direction of travel. Ensure to manage the interactions effectively, as the catapult can eliminate the avatar.\n\n3. **Manage Movement:** Since the orientation of the avatar is vital, use direction to control movement. This can help navigate through tight spots and avoid deadly encounters (e.g., water).\n\n4. **Preserve the Avatar:** Be cautious with moves and prioritize avoiding interactions that lead to losing the avatar. Carefully analyze the level space to maximize the number of unblocked paths.\n\n5. **Sequential Strategy:** Solve the level in stages by clearing areas, eliminating threats, and redirecting towards the goal. \n\n6. **Track Sprite Counts:** Keep an eye on your sprite counts to avoid losing the avatar prematurely and ensure you're aware of the number of goals left to fulfill the win conditions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can improve their chances of navigating challenges successfully and reaching the end goal without losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

I will choose to move down, which is `ACTION_DOWN (3)`.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action will move the avatar downwards, assuming it successfully navigates past the other sprites in the downward direction while keeping the goal in mind. The expectation is to see if this leads closer to the goal or creates a new opportunity without losing the avatar to hazards.",
