Players must navigate the environment, make tactical decisions based on interactions, and solve the challenges presented by the layout.\n\n#### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including walls, water, a goal, a catapult, and the player avatar. The mechanics revolve around interactions between these sprites.\n2. **Movement and Direction**: Players can orient their avatar (the character they control) to face north, south, east, or west and interact with the environment accordingly.\n3. **Bullet System**: Players can create a bullet that interacts with walls and other sprites, suggesting a shooting or projectile mechanic.\n4. **Interactivity**: The game has various interactions that trigger specific outcomes (e.g., killing an avatar when it touches water, transforming when facing directions, and defeating a sprite when hitting certain targets).\n5. **Attraction Mechanism**: The catapult attracts the player's avatar, potentially indicating a strategic element where players need to navigate around it.\n\n#### Objective:\n- The main objective of the game is to reach the goal (`goal avatar`) while avoiding being killed by water or other dangerous interactions. Players accumulate score changes based on their interactions with sprites such as the catapult.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no more goal sprites remaining (`SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True`).\n- **Loss Condition**: Players lose if there are no avatars remaining (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the maze structure. Identify regions where walls or water limit movement and use the catapults strategically to attract your avatar where needed.\n   \n2. **Plan Movement**: Since movement is directional, plan your orientations carefully. Use the north, south, east, and west transformations effectively to navigate obstacles and move toward the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Projectiles**: Make use of the bullet interactions wisely. Understand how they can destroy walls or clear a path to advance towards the goal or obtain a score.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of water, as contact will result in game loss. Use surrounding structures to block or navigate away from any risky areas.\n\n5. **Optimize Sprite Usage**: Manage how many avatars are in play and consider methods of scoring to maintain a winning position. Avoid reckless interactions that could lead to avatar loss.\n\n6. **Experiment with the Catapult**: Since the catapult can attract your avatar, experiment with its placement and try to use it to clear paths, possibly even leading your avatar closer to the goal while evading hazards.\n\nBy combining efficient navigation tactics with strategic use of projectiles and awareness of interactions, players can effectively work towards meeting the win conditions of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To determine the best action in the current game state, let's identify key elements:\n\n1. **Map Overview**: \n   - The map consists of walls (`*`), safe floors (`_`, `g`, etc.), water (`e`), and various \ubaa9\ud45c(`g` and `#`).\n   - The goal (`#`) is located at `(14, 1)` and `(14, 14)`.\n\n2. **Avatar Position**: You have not specified your avatar's position in the last provided state. Therefore, I'll assume your avatar is placed strategically to reach a goal or avoid other hazards.\n\n3. **Actions Available**: The available actions correspond to movement in different directions, but factor in the rotation mechanic that may affect movement.\n\n4. **Strategic Considerations**:\n   - The primary goal is to reach a goal while avoiding water.\n   - Maximizing movement and minimizing risk is crucial, especially since water can lead to losing the avatar.\n\n### Proposed Action\nAssuming the avatar is facing a direction that might allow it to move towards the nearest goal (i.e., `(14, 1)` or `(14, 14)`), I suggest taking the action that moves the avatar closer to one of these targets while staying clear of water.\n\nIf the avatar is initially at `(12, 1)`, moving down (action `3`) would lead you closer to a goal:\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\n\nThis action is expected to align with the strategy by potentially moving towards the goal located at `(14, 1)`. If the avatar holds a face-direction that allows it to avoid water and walls, this move should be effective in reaching the goal successfully.",
