It involves directional movement and interaction with various sprites impacting progress and outcomes.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** There are several different sprites that interact with one another, including avatars, walls, goals, water, catapults, and bullets.\n- **Movement & Orientation:** The game allows characters (avatars) to face different directions (north, south, east, west), and the reorientation plays a key role in navigating the map.\n- **Interactions:** Various interactions create unique game dynamics, such as killing sprites (for instance, when an avatar contacts a goal or catapult), transforming states (like the avatar changing to a specific direction), or being killed by water.\n- **Sprite Transformation:** Certain interactions lead to transformation of sprite types, influencing how the game is played (e.g., mapping orientation).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective seems to be to reach a designated 'goal' while managing the avatar's interactions with walls, bullets, and dangers like water. You need to eliminate your avatar to complete the game successfully by reaching the goal, all while keeping your avatars alive as long as possible (no sprites left result in a loss).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when all goal sprites are removed from the counter (limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost when there are no avatars left (sprite counter limit=0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Map Familiarity:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level to identify possible paths and positions for sprites like walls and the goal.\n   - Take note of potential dead ends or high-risk areas (for example, where water is).\n\n2. **Optimize Movement:**\n   - Use orientation changes strategically to navigate effectively. Shift direction at appropriate times to avoid walls and water.\n   - Focus on using bullets wisely \u2014 they can transform walls into moving entities, potentially providing alternate pathways.\n\n3. **Prioritize Goals:**\n   - Seek to prioritize reaching and interacting with goal sprites to eliminate them from the board, strategically dealing with other sprites like the catapult that could be lethal if not managed carefully.\n\n4. **Understand Sprite Interactions:**\n   - Leverage interactions to your advantage. For instance, bullets can be used to change wall statuses to moving sprites, paving new paths.\n   - Carefully manage contact with catapults and water, as these directly influence sprite counts and survival.\n\n5. **Plan for Sequencing:**\n   - Develop a sequence of moves in advance that allows you to clear goal sprites while maintaining avatar survivability. Keep in mind that excessive movement in the wrong direction may lead to losing avatars quickly.\n\n6. **Handle Risks with Caution:**\n   - Beware of water, as it can eliminate avatars. Always plan routes that prioritize the safety of your avatars while approaching goal interactions.\n\nBy employing a strategic approach to manage your resources and effectively navigate the level, you can improve your chances of winning the game while experiencing the challenges posed by various sprite interactions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, it appears that there are several goals (`g`) that we need to reach and eliminate in order to win. The immediate tasks involve navigating the avatar strategically to interact with these goals while avoiding hazards like water (`e`).\n\n### Analysis of the Current Map State:\n- The positions of the goals are at (4, 6), (8, 9), (13, 7), and (14, 14).\n- The avatar is currently positioned at (12, 1) facing south (as indicated by the orientation leading to the possible actions).\n- There are walls (`*`) blocking many direct paths, and water bodies which can eliminate sprites if encountered.\n- The pathway might involve using the moving floors (`$`) and interacting with walls strategically to clear paths towards the goals.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move Towards the Goal at (14, 14)**: This goal is crucial as it is located at the end of the map's row, likely requiring fewer moves to reach compared to the other goals.\n2. **Avoid Water**: The immediate strategy should focus on moving downward to avoid any water crossings that could impact avatar health.\n3. **Plan Actions**: The avatar may need to frequently rotate to face the correct direction to navigate around obstacles and move closer to the goal.\n\n### Action Plan:\nCurrently, the avatar is positioned at (12, 1) facing south. A potential action could be to move south further downwards toward rows where more space appears, and subsequently look for pathways toward the goal at (14, 14).\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is to move down to position (13, 1). It's a step towards evaluating our next moves while maintaining trajectory toward the goal, avoiding immediate hazards.",
