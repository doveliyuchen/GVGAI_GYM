Players must navigate through obstacles using specific mechanics and accomplish set goals.\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n- **Movement and Orientation:** The player (referred to as \"avatar\") can change orientations (north, south, east, west) to interact with the environment, including walls and the catapult.\n- **Interaction with Objects:** The avatar can engage with various objects:\n  - The catapult can be activated by the avatar to eliminate it (gain a score change).\n  - The avatar can interact with walls, affecting their position (potentially reversing or stepping back).\n  - Encountering water results in the avatar's defeat.\n- **Bullet Mechanics:** The game includes projectiles (bullets) that can interact with walls, transforming the wall's state.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal of the game is to eliminate all instances of the \"goal\" sprite while managing the health of the avatar (avoiding interactions with water which is deadly). Players must navigate through the maze-like level and utilize specific mechanics strategically.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning:** The game is won when all goal sprites are eliminated (the SpriteCounter for goals reaches zero).\n- **Losing:** The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatars reaches zero).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Map Awareness:**\n   - Pay attention to the layout and positioning of walls, water, and goals. Use this information to map out a clear path to each goal.\n\n2. **Orientation Management:**\n   - Use the orientation transformation wisely. Make sure you face the correct direction when engaging with other sprites, especially when needing to utilize walls or the catapult.\n\n3. **Utilize the Catapult Effectively:**\n   - The catapult is a helpful tool for defeating the avatar (you). Think ahead about how you can use it to either distract the enemy or redirect them away from yourself.\n\n4. **Avoid Water:**\n   - Be cautious around areas with water. Plan your movement to ensure you do not accidentally position yourself for a lethal interaction with the water.\n\n5. **Bullet Strategy:**\n   - Use bullets to affect wall interactions, which can help clear paths or change walls to moving sprites which may facilitate different strategies depending on their configuration.\n\n6. **Sequential Targeting:**\n   - Focus on eliminating goal sprites one at a time, moving systematically across the map to not leave areas behind. \n\n7. **Backtracking When Necessary:**\n   - If you\u2019re cornered or about to hit water, don\u2019t hesitate to backtrack and find another route or reposition yourself.\n\nBy maintaining an adaptable strategy and being mindful of interactions and the level layout, you can navigate through effectively, eliminating all goals while ensuring your avatar's survival.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current game state, let's analyze the avatar's position and potential actions:\n\n1. **Avatar Position:** The avatar is not defined in the provided map representation. However, based on the context, it is generally considered an important factor but needs to be physically represented on the map to identify a possible course of action.\n2. **Objects of Interest:** There are multiple goal sprites represented by `g` and also walls (`*`) and water (`e`) that should be avoided.\n3. **Available Actions:** The possible directional actions are LEFT (1), RIGHT (2), DOWN (3), and UP (4). \n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Identify the current location of the avatar within the map based on previous states, if necessary.\n- Verify against obstacles like water and plan a route to interact with goals without putting the avatar in danger.\n- If available, interact with the catapult or nearby walls to gain a tactical advantage.\n\nSince the avatar's position is key to determining the next action and it was not explicitly stated in the initial map, we need to confirm where the avatar is situated to make a justified move. \n\nHowever, if the avatar is hypothetically located near walls and goals, and given that we should avoid water, I expect to take an action that either rotates toward a goal or clears a path.\n\nLet's assume the avatar is near the horizontal lane with goals and try an action. \n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n(Going down to evaluate the next position.) \n\nThis action allows for potential movement towards the goals while maintaining strategic awareness to backtrack if areas are blocked. Let's see if it correctly aligns with the previous state context!",
