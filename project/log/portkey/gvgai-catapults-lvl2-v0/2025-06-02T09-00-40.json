Players likely navigate a 2D environment with obstacles and objectives, incorporating strategic thinking and possibly some timing mechanics, given the interactions with various sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Several types of immovable and moving sprites are present, such as walls, water, and different directional sprites for orientation.\n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can face and interact with other sprites to transform its orientation or get killed.\n- **Interactions**: Various interactions dictate how sprites interact with one another, such as:\n  - Moving forward into walls causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Interacting with the catapult allows the player to change focus.\n  - Certain interactions lead to player death (like moving into water) or scoring points (like the avatar destroying other avatars).\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite while managing sprite interactions strategically. Players need to ensure that their avatars remain in play while simultaneously getting rid of other avatars, as the goal condition stipulates all avatars must be defeated or removed for a win.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if there are no 'goal' sprites left (i.e., all are successfully reached).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if their avatar count drops to zero, indicating they cannot progress further.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify where walls, water, and goals are located to plan your movements.\n2. **Avatar Management**: Keep track of your avatars and eliminate enemies using your 'catapult.' Understand each avatar's movement and interaction with walls.\n3. **Movement Strategy**: Use directional controls wisely. Aim to move your avatar in the most efficient direction toward the goal while avoiding water and walls.\n4. **Careful Interactions**: Use the interactivity between various sprites to your advantage. Pushing against walls can allow you to redirect movements without losing avatars, while utilizing the catapult can help you eliminate other avatars without risk to your own.\n5. **Scoring Points**: Focus on obtaining points by eliminating avatars, which may provide advantages in progressing through levels.\n\nBy carefully planning your moves and utilizing your sprites' interactions to advance towards the goal while preventing loss conditions, you can maximize your chances of success in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

Currently, to devise the next action, I need to analyze the current position of my avatar which is represented as 'a'. \n\nHowever, since the positions and interactions of the avatar have not been explicitly mentioned in the current state description, I will assume that I'm in a strategic position where movement is necessary to gauge the next steps without getting too close to wall boundaries or water.\n\nTo manage my movements efficiently towards the goal, I will opt to move **down** towards the lower rows where the goal is situated. \n\nThus, I will choose:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should help in approaching the goal and I expect it will get me closer to the target while maintaining the avatar's safety.",
