Players need to navigate an environment filled with obstacles and interact with various sprites to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent walls, goals, water, a catapult, and the player's avatar.\n2. **Movement**: The player's avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west) and change orientation accordingly, which likely affects movement or interaction.\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The player can transform their avatar to face different directions.\n   - The player interacts with walls and water, with certain interactions leading to sprite transformations or consequences (e.g., water kills the avatar).\n   - The catapult seems to capture the avatar's attention and can potentially launch or propel it.\n4. **Goals**: The objective is to reach the goal while managing interactions that may lead to the avatar's elimination.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe primary objective is to navigate to the 'goal' sprite while avoiding water and other dangerous interactions, such as walls that push the avatar back. Players need to collect the 'goal' without being killed by water or other hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- Win Condition: The player wins when the avatar reaches the 'goal' sprite, which leads to the termination of sprite counters for 'goal.'\n- Loss Condition: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated, indicated by the counter reaching zero.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Button and directional controls are likely key to navigation.\n2. **Planning Movement**: Anticipate the interactions with walls and water. Always plan your next move to avoid areas that could lead to your avatar's demise.\n3. **Using the Catapult**: Strategically engage with the catapult to potentially access difficult spaces or traverse across the level.\n4. **Directional Strategy**: Since facing different directions influences interactions, plan your routes based on the orientation. Always adjust your avatar's direction to ensure maximum movement efficiency.\n5. **Goal Orientation**: Make advancing toward the goal your primary focus while being cautious of the hazards in your path. Collect the goals while avoiding interactions that could harm your avatar.\n\nIn summary, the game is a puzzle-platform challenge that requires thoughtful maneuvering and strategic interaction to reach the goal while avoiding hazards, particularly managing the unique mechanics of the sprites in play.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

I avoid stepping into water cells (`e`), which will eliminate my avatar.\n2. I should try to navigate toward at least one of the goals with minimum risks.\n3. I can utilize the catapults (`@`) found on the map to potentially navigate over dangerous spots if needed. There's one at `(4, 8)` and another at `(8, 5)`.\n\nSince the avatar's initial position is ambiguous in this state, I will attempt an exploratory movement to identify my placement and gather more information about my surroundings.\n\nI will take action by moving **down**: \n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nMoving down may reveal vital information or provide a path toward the goals, complying with the strategy of map familiarization. My expectation is to identify the safe path towards the goal while being cautious of water hazards.",
