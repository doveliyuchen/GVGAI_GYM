    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game can be identified as a **puzzle/platformer** with elements of **strategy** and **resource management**. The interaction mechanics suggest a focus on solving spatial challenges while navigating a grid-like environment.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various types of sprites (like walls, water, catapults, and goal) are defined, each serving a specific function and effect on interactions with the player's avatar.\n2. **Movement and Orientation**: The avatar can face and transform into different orientations (north, south, east, west) depending on the direction of interaction, suggesting the importance of directional navigation in solving puzzles.\n3. **Bullet and Walls**: Bullets can interact with walls to create a \"moving\" effect. This highlights a mechanic where projectiles may influence the environment rather than just act as offensive tools.\n4. **Goals and Death**: The player wins by reaching a goal sprite while they can lose if the avatar is eliminated (e.g., by water or from being shot by a catapult).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe objective is to navigate through a maze-like structure, avoid death, and reach the goal sprite. The game also incorporates a scoring system through certain interactions (like being shot by a catapult).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if all goal sprites are reached (SpriteCounter for 'goal' reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if there are no remaining avatar sprites (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the layout of the level (as provided in the layout diagram). Identify walls, hazards (like water), and the location of the goal.\n\n2. **Plan Your Moves**: Think ahead. Each move can change your facing direction; thus, consider which direction will best suit your next planned interaction.\n\n3. **Use Bullets Wisely**: Bullets can transform walls, creating new pathways or strategies. Use them strategically to navigate around obstacles and create opportunities.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of water and try to predict the timing or pattern of the catapult. If you spot a catapult near the goal, you may need to lure it away or time your moves to avoid being shot.\n\n5. **Transform Efficiently**: Be mindful about transforming into different orientations; each transformation restricts movement options but can also open up new paths, so use them efficiently to navigate through the level.\n\n6. **Goal Awareness**: Always keep track of the location of the goal sprite and make it a priority to reach it while minimizing losses.\n\n7. **Exploration and Experimentation**: Since puzzles can have multiple solutions, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different paths and interactions to uncover the best strategy for each level.\n\nBy following these strategies and being cautious and strategic in your movements, you will improve your chances of successfully completing the levels while maximizing your score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
