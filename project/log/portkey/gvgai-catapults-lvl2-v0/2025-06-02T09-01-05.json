    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Genre\nBased on the elements described and the interactions among sprites, this game can be classified as a **puzzle-adventure** game, where the player likely navigates a maze and interacts with various objects to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of multiple sprite types, including:\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers.\n   - **Water**: Acts as a hazard that can eliminate the player.\n   - **Catapult**: Likely a mechanism that interacts with the player character.\n   - **Orientations**: Different orientations (north, south, east, west) represent directions the avatar can face and potentially move.\n\n2. **Avatar Control**: The player controls an avatar that can change directions and possibly move through the environment.\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can transform into different directional states (facing west, east, etc.).\n   - The catapult can \"kill\" the avatar if it interacts with it, scoring points.\n   - The avatar can take damage or be removed from the game by interacting with hazards (like water) or walls if certain gameplay conditions are met.\n   - When the avatar reaches the goal (green door), it is removed from the game, indicating the level is complete.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objectives of the game appear to be:\n- Navigate through the maze (the level layout) and avoid obstacles (water and walls).\n- Reach the goal sprite (the green door) while potentially utilizing the catapult for point-scoring mechanics.\n- Survive until all goals (doors) are reached while minimizing avatar losses.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All goal sprites (doors) must be collected or reached, reducing their counter to zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar's count must not reach zero; if it does, the player loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Path**: Identify the locations of walls and water hazards early on to chart a safe path. Using the layout as a reference, devise a strategy to avoid water while heading towards the goal.\n\n2. **Use the Catapult Wisely**: If the catapult can kill the avatar but also score points, determine if interacting with it is strategically beneficial. If it leads to success later in the game, it may be worth the risk.\n\n3. **Maximize Movement Direction**: Use the orientation transformations to efficiently navigate the maze. Understand the layout to avoid getting stuck or damaged, particularly near walls and hazards.\n\n4. **Keep Track of Progress**: Monitor the avatar and goal counters. Set goals for progressing through the maze based on how many goals remain.\n\n5. **Experiment with Interactions**: Since interactions can alter the state of the game, explore which combinations of conditions lead to favorable outcomes and exploit them to progress through levels.\n\nBy employing careful navigation, strategic interactions, and planning for potential hazards, players can effectively advance in this puzzle-adventure game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To determine the optimal move from the current state, let's first analyze the layout of the maze and the current position of the avatar.\n\nThe avatar is represented as 'a' and is currently at (row, col) = (unknown) since its position wasn't specified in the grid information. \n\n### Key Points:\n- The objective is to navigate to the goal ('g' or '#') on the maze while avoiding walls ('*') and water hazards ('e').\n- Based on the information provided, the potential movements the avatar can make are left, right, down, or up.\n- The catapult, moving floors, and other interactive elements in the maze can change the gameplay dynamics.\n\nNow, the task is to select an action that would either advance us toward the goal or reposition the avatar to allow for further movement thereafter. Given that the last action didn't result in a movement towards the goal, I will choose the current state and strategy to plan a new move.\n\n**Considering Target Goal Locations:**\n- The avatar needs to reach the goal locations, notably located at (14, 1) and (14, 14).\n\n### Moving Toward the Goal\nSince no specific avatar position is mentioned, I will focus on reaching one of the known goal positions. \n\n- Assuming the avatar is positioned within an allowable distance to quickly move towards (14, 1) or (14, 14) while checking for available paths:\n  - If moving downwards (action 3) is feasible considering the immediate surroundings\u2014especially for avoiding walls and water\u2014this would be a productive move to get closer to either goal.\n\nNow I will make an action that could lead towards a potential goal.\n\n```Action:ACTION_DOWN```\n\nThis action is expected to help navigate closer to the lower rows of the maze, where goal entries '#', 'g' are located while avoiding wall collisions and hazards.",
