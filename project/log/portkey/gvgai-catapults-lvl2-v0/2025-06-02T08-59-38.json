    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n**Game Analysis**\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game seems to belong to the puzzle or strategy genre, where the player likely navigates through a grid-like level filled with obstacles, enemies, and a goal requiring critical thinking and possibly some tactical movement.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- The game features various sprites, including walls, a goal, an avatar (the player-controlled character), catapults (possibly as enemies), moving objects (bullets), and different types of directional indicators (facing north, south, east, west).\n- Players control the avatar to navigate the level, interact with catapults, and avoid being killed by obstacles like water (which kills the avatar) and walls (which can transform when interacted with).\n- The avatar can change direction and orientation based on interactions with directional sprites.\n  \n**Objective:**\nThe aim of the game is to reach the goal sprite while avoiding getting killed by water and avoiding certain enemy interactions. Progress may involve manipulating the environment or enemies to create a path toward the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game ends successfully (win) when there are no \u201cgoal\u201d sprites left on the screen (SpriteCounter limit=0).\n- The game ends unsuccessfully (loss) if there are no remaining avatars (SpriteCounter limit=0).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Environment:**\n   - Examine the layout and identify walls and obstacles. Understand where the catapults are located and how they operate.\n   \n2. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Move methodically, always check for immediate threats (like water). Use the walls intelligently to block incoming threats from bullets or catapults.\n   - Use direction-changing sprites wisely to direct your avatar toward the goal.\n\n3. **Engage with the Environment:**\n   - Leverage the catapults to your advantage. If they attract your gaze, be quick to evaluate the situation and maneuver deliberately.\n   - Avoid collisions with water and walls and try to manipulate moving sprites to your benefit.\n\n4. **Check All Paths:**\n   - Stay aware that some paths might lead to traps or dead ends. Explore various routes to reach the goal while ensuring your avatar's safety.\n\n5. **Prioritize Goal Completion:**\n   - Focus on reaching the goal as soon as possible while still managing threats. Avoid unnecessary encounters that could lead to a loss.\n\nBy following these strategies and remaining vigilant, players should be able to navigate through the game efficiently and work towards achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, we need to identify the avatar's position, obstacles such as water and walls, as well as the goals and other entities on the map.\n\n1. **Understanding the Map:**\n   - The player's avatar ('a') is not explicitly stated in the current state, indicating we may need to assume or infer its position.\n   - The walls ('*') occupy the outer edges of the map.\n   - Multiple instances of water ('e') are present, which are dangerous for the avatar. \n   - The goals ('#' and 'g') are present on the map at specific locations.\n\n2. **Goals:**\n   - Achieving the aim of the game involves reaching the goal while avoiding water.\n\n3. **Avatar Position:**\n   - We need to infer or locate our avatar. However, since the avatar isn't listed in the current state, we will assume it is somewhere within the map based on the absence of specific mention.\n\n**Sense Making and Movement:**\nGiven the crucial information that the avatar's position isn't explicitly stated (commonly required), we can hypothesize its position might likely be around the many open spaces since all walls encapsulate the edges. \n\nThe strategy involves:\n\n- Avoid immediate water threats.\n- Identify the closest goal while avoiding walls.\n- Use directional movements to get closer to the target while avoiding any danger.\n\nNext, let's assume the avatar is starting at a position (4, 6) as an example\u2014this puts it right next to the goal at (14, 1) quickly through a series of lateral or directional moves. However, since the position of the avatar is crucial and I previously assumed it, I need to define an action. \n\nFor our first move, we will assume a challenging position of being caught between two walled sections. \n\nLet's attempt to move towards the nearest goal with the assumption of being anywhere that allows for movement. I'll pick **ACTION_UP**, while taking precautions for walls or water.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis move should take the avatar upwards, assuming we're situated appropriately, creating more pathways based on the rules. My expectation is to check if it evokes any noticeable changes in the avatar's position while maintaining safety against water or bounding off walls.",
