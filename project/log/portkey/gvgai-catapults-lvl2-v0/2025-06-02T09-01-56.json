    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle or strategy game**, likely with elements of adventure due to its exploration and goal-oriented aspects. Players navigate a grid-based environment with various sprites representing different objects and obstacles.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game has various types of sprites including:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Such as walls, water, and goals.\n   - **Moving Objects**: An avatar that can change orientation and move through the level.\n   - **Projectiles**: Bullet sprites that interact with walls and other objects.\n2. **Interactions**: The gameplay revolves around how the avatar interacts with different sprites:\n   - The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west), which seem to influence its transformation into corresponding directional states.\n   - When the avatar collides with catapults, it attracts their gaze\u2014potentially as a means to redirect or influence movement.\n   - The game contains kill conditions; for example, if the avatar touches water, it \"dies.\"\n   - Moving towards goals results in game termination and a win if all goals are reached.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to **reach and eliminate all goal sprites**. This can be inferred from the termination condition: a win occurs when there are no more goal sprites left on the board. The player must navigate and manipulate the avatar and other sprites to achieve this.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the count of `goal` sprites reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the count of `avatar` sprites reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Mapping out the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify the positions of walls, water, catapults, and goals to plan your movement strategy.\n  \n2. **Efficient Navigation**:\n   - Utilize the orientation mechanics effectively. Transform and move in the direction required to approach goals while avoiding obstacles and water.\n   - If the catapults redirect your gaze or movement, consider how this might be leveraged to clear paths.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Be cautious of moving into water, as it results in an instant loss of the avatar.\n   - Walls are crucial for steering your movements; use them to make strategic decisions when navigating the grid.\n  \n4. **Utilize Scoring**:\n   - Each time the avatar moves into a goal, ensure that you are aware of the score changes and adjust your strategy accordingly. Maximizing points while achieving the objective can offer insight into furthering your success.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves**: Since the layout seems to include obstacles and potential for multiple paths to each goal, plan your moves several steps ahead to ensure efficient sprite removal without getting trapped or losing avatars.\n\nIn summary, focus on strategic navigation, interaction with sprites, and cautious avoidance of hazards to successfully reach and eliminate all goal sprites in the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "To determine the best action, let's first analyze the current state. There is a large grid with various sprites represented by their corresponding characters. \n\nFrom the provided map, notable observations include:\n\n1. The avatar seems to be positioned in a clear section of the grid with multiple pathways available, along with various obstacles like walls (`*`) and hazards like water (`e`).\n2. Several goals (`g` and `#`) are visible on the map, and the main objective is to reach them to win the game.\n3. The interactions suggest that the avatar needs to avoid water, as it would lead to a loss, and effectively navigate towards the goals.\n\n**Current Strategy:**\n- To win, the avatar must reach and eliminate all goals.\n- It has to maneuver around obstacles while avoiding hazards.\n- Given the visible goals, a climb towards the goal positions that are reachable is crucial.\n\nNext, we need to determine the avatar's current direction and its surroundings.\n\n### Proposed Action Analysis:\n\n1. The avatar can potentially face directions and the last-known position should change based on executed actions.\n2. Since the avatar must move towards objectives while evading hazards, careful planning is essential.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nFrom the provided grid, the upper row (row 0) is fully blocked by walls, meaning the player should move vertically or horizontally. \n\nConsidering that:\n- **The goal at (14, 1), (14, 14), perhaps impacts first strategies.**\n  \nLet\u2019s execute a movement downward to explore more clear paths while avoiding walls and water:\n``` Action: 3 ``` \nThis action moves the avatar downwards, and I expect to see further clear paths towards the goals or potential moving objects that can be manipulated creatively in subsequent steps.",
