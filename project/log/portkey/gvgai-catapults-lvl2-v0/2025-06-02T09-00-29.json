    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is a detailed breakdown of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fall into the **puzzle/platformer** genre, with elements resembling adventure and strategic movement typical in 2D games. The presence of sprites with defined interactions suggests some form of challenge requiring player problem-solving and exploration.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character, likely controlled by the player to navigate the environment.\n   - **Walls & Floors:** These act as barriers or boundaries within the level layout.\n   - **Water:** Acts as a hazard, where moving into it results in the player\u2019s death.\n   - **Catapults:** Can kill the player avatar and represent a mechanism for player interaction.\n   - **Orientations:** Players can face specific directions (North, South, East, West), which likely dictate movement and actions.\n   - **Goals:** The destination the player must reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - **Movement and Orientation:** Players can rotate to face different directions, affecting their next movement or action.\n   - **Hazards:** Interactions with water kill the player, while walls can push the player back if hit.\n   - **Goal Interaction:** Reaching the goal results in the player's death but also potentially indicates win conditions.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the **goal** while avoiding deaths caused by water and catapults. The player must navigate through the environment, manipulating direction and movement to successfully reach the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no avatars left in play, which suggests players must maneuver their avatar towards the goal effectively.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (i.e., when the sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements:** Carefully plan your movements to avoid areas with water and any catapults. If obstacles prevent direct routes, re-evaluate your orientation and look for alternate paths.\n  \n2. **Utilize Orientation:** Make effective use of the avatar\u2019s ability to change direction (north, south, east, west). Facing the correct direction may allow for better strategic movement towards the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Make a mental note of sections with water and catapults before engaging those areas. Always observe how your avatar interacts with these hazards (like walls pushing back) to prevent unexpected deaths.\n\n4. **Create safe paths:** If possible, manipulate the environment by using obstacles to create safe corridors or routes that isolate you from hazards.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:** It may be necessary to experiment with the environment and interactions to gain a deeper understanding of timing and spatial awareness related to the catapults and walls.\n\nBy following these strategies and keeping the game's mechanics and objectives in mind, players can optimize their chances of successfully navigating through the game and reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
