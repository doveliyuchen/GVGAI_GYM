    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here's an analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game is likely a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of strategy and interactive mechanics. The presence of movement, obstacles, and the use of a catapult suggests a need for problem-solving to navigate the environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game features various sprites, including immovable terrain (floor, wall, water), movable objects (avatar, bullet), and objectives (goal, catapult).\n- **Interaction Mechanics:** \n  - The avatar can transform orientation (north, south, east, west) and must navigate carefully using the catapult to interact with other sprites.\n  - The bullet can transform into a moving avatar when it hits a wall, which may indicate projectiles can be employed to solve puzzles.\n  - Water is lethal to the moving avatar, emphasizing caution in navigation.\n- **Orientation Transformation:** The avatar must change direction to successfully move through the maze and reach objectives.\n  \n### Game Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the **goal** sprite, represented as a green door, by manipulating the avatar through the level.\n- Additionally, the avatar must avoid dangers (like water) and utilize the catapult to move objects or progress through the Terrain.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The game is won when the player\u2019s avatar reaches the **goal**, reducing the count of goal sprites to zero.\n- The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (count of avatars reaches zero) before reaching the goal.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout. Observe where walls, water, and the goal are positioned.\n2. **Controlled Movement:** Change the avatar's direction wisely to navigate through obstacles without running into dangers like water.\n3. **Use of Catapult:** Allocate the catapult's opportunity effectively to deal with any obstacles or projectiles. It\u2019s a key interaction that can save or eliminate.\n4. **Puzzles and Timing:** Recognize that each level may have puzzles that require timing \u2014 carefully plan moves to avoid traps and dangers while utilizing current tools (like bullets) effectively.\n5. **Resource Management:** Keep track of the number of sprites (both avatars and goals) to avoid accidental losses that could lead to a quick game over.\n\nBy combining careful navigation, strategic use of interactive elements, and awareness of the level layout, players can effectively work towards clearing the game\u2019s puzzles and objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

It is crucial to analyze if the last action caused the avatar to change position.\n\nSince there are no visible immediate actions that lead directly to the goal, a strategic approach is required to avoid water:\n\n- **Goal is at (14,1)**: Ensure to move toward this goal while avoiding any water hazards that can result in a loss.\n\nTo make progress, I will focus on the next valid and safe move toward the goal. Currently, the easiest and most straightforward move is one space directly downward since my understanding states it's likely the avatar isn't already positioned in a way that it contacted water.\n\nI will attempt to move **down** to potentially continue toward the goal.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nI expect this action to move the avatar closer to the goal (14,1) while remaining on safe terrain. The analysis suggests this aligns well with navigating safely and efficiently toward the objective.",
