    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle game, likely a Sokoban variant (box-pushing puzzle).\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an avatar (\"rat1\") that can move.\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar can push boxes (\"block3\").\n*   **Obstacles:** Walls (\"dirtwall\") are impassable. Holes (\"hole1\") are teleporters or hazards.\n*   **Interaction:** Pushing a box into a hole destroys the box.\n*   **Teleportation:** Holes are \"portal=True\" implying avatar can enter the hole and appear at a different hole location.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The player needs to get the avatar to an exit (\"cheese\").\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All exits are eliminated (presumably by the avatar reaching them). `SpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0 win=True`\n*   **Loss:**\n    *   The avatar is eliminated (killed). `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False` Likely, the avatar can be killed if it enters a hole: `avatar hole > killSprite scoreChange=-1`.\n    *   The game times out. `Timeout limit=1000 win=False`\n*   **Score:** The player can gain/lose points by exiting or falling in a hole.\n\n**Level Layout Key:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `x`: Exit\n*   `.`: Floor\n*   `1`: Box\n*   `h`: Hole\n*   `A`: Avatar (starting position)\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Hole Network:** Carefully observe the placement of holes. These are likely teleporters, and understanding how they connect is crucial.\n2.  **Box Management:** Plan box movements carefully. Boxes can be pushed, but likely not pulled. Avoid deadlocks where boxes are trapped.\n3.  **Avoid Holes (Initially):** Since falling into a hole results in a score penalty and potentially a loss, avoid them until their purpose is understood (teleportation is key).\n4.  **Path Planning:** Visualize the path the avatar needs to take to reach the exit, considering wall locations and the need to manipulate the boxes.\n5.  **Prioritize Exits:** Focus on getting the avatar to the exits as the primary goal.\n6.  **Time Management:** Don't take too long, or you'll time out.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
