Game Genre:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game much like Sokoban. You control a moving character (an \u201cavatar,\u201d pictured here as a rat) who must navigate a level filled with boxes, walls, holes, and an exit.\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement comes in discrete steps on a grid. The avatar moves around the level, and when it bumps into walls it is forced to step back.\n\u2003\u2022 You can push boxes by running into them\u2014the \u201cbox avatar > bounceForward\u201d interaction means boxes are nudged forward when you contact them.\n\u2003\u2022 There are hazards: holes are deadly; if the avatar falls into a hole the \u201cavatar hole > killSprite scoreChange=-1\u201d rule kicks in (and similarly a box that ends up in a hole is removed).\n\u2003\u2022 The exit, which has a door (cheese) appearance and green color, interacts with the avatar. When the avatar moves onto it (triggering \u201cexit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=1\u201d), the exit is removed. Because the win condition is tied to the exit disappearing (\u201cSpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0 win=True\u201d), stepping on the exit wins the level.\n\u2003\u2022 There is also a \u201cbox wall exit box > undoAll\u201d interaction. Although the rule is a bit intricate, it suggests that if a box is pushed such that it touches a wall or the exit (or possibly is involved in a certain arrangement with them), the game undoes that move. This acts as a safeguard against moves that would break the intended puzzle logic.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 The objective is to reach and step on the exit (the door with cheese) with your avatar. Doing so causes the exit to vanish, meeting the win condition.\n\u2003\u2022 Loss conditions occur if your avatar is killed (for example, by falling into a hole: \u201cSpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False\u201d) or if the move count exceeds 1000 (timeout).\n\n4. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Think ahead: since movement is on a grid, plan your path so that you do not accidentally force your avatar into a hole.\n\u2003\u2022 Practice careful box pushing: some puzzles in the level likely require moving boxes into precise locations. Be mindful that pushing a box against a wall or the exit in the wrong way might trigger an \u201cundo\u201d (resetting your move), so time your pushes carefully.\n\u2003\u2022 Use boxes wisely: consider them as tools that might help you clear a path or block a dangerous area\u2014but also remember they can be lost if they fall into holes.\n\u2003\u2022 Monitor your moves: since there is a timeout limit (1000 moves), efficiency matters. Work out a sequence of moves that safely guides you to the exit without wasting actions.\n\u2003\u2022 Stay alert to hazards: remember that holes are lethal for both the avatar and boxes, so avoid any step that might lead to an accidental plunge.\n\nIn summary, this puzzle game requires careful, strategic movement and precise box manipulation to safely navigate your avatar through obstacles and hazards, and finally reach the exit for victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> a\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
