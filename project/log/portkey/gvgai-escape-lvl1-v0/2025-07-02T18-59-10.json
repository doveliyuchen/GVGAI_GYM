It's blocked by 'wall' sprites.\n*   **Pushing:** The 'avatar' can push 'box' sprites. If a box is pushed against a wall, the avatar bounces back.\n*   **Holes:** 'hole' sprites are dangerous; the avatar dies if it enters one, decreasing the score.\n*   **Exits:** The 'exit' (cheese) is the goal. The avatar must reach an exit to increase the score and complete the level.\n*   **Box Reset:** If boxes, walls and exits interact, the game does undo all actions.\n*   **Box Destruction:** Boxes that enter holes are destroyed.\n\n**Objective:** Guide the 'avatar' to an 'exit' (cheese) to win the level, probably by strategically pushing 'box' sprites.\n\n**Win Condition:** All 'exit' sprites are removed from the board.\n\n**Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   The 'avatar' dies (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). The rat is likely killed when falling into a hole (interaction avatar hole > killSprite).\n*   The game times out.\n*   Possibly: Running out of moves if the level design traps the player with no way to reach an exit.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   'w' represents 'wall' sprites.\n*   '.' represents empty space (likely floor).\n*   'A' represents the starting position of the 'avatar'.\n*   '1' represents 'box' sprites.\n*   'h' represents 'hole' sprites.\n*   'x' represents 'exit' sprites.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan ahead:** Sokoban games require careful planning. Randomly pushing boxes will likely lead to unsolvable situations.\n2.  **Avoid holes:** The primary threat seems to be the holes. Be very careful not to accidentally push boxes into them (unless necessary), and definitely avoid walking into them yourself.\n3.  **Box placement:** Think about where you want the boxes to end up. Can you box off any paths?\n4.  **One box at a time:** Often, it's best to focus on moving one box at a time towards the desired location.\n5.  **Consider the endgame:** Think about how the arrangement of boxes will allow you to reach the exit once all are positioned.\n6.  **Utilize Resets:** If boxes, walls and exits interact, the game does undo all actions. It can be used to try different strategies.\n\nIn essence, this is a classic Sokoban-style puzzle where you need to strategically push boxes around to clear a path for the avatar to reach the exit, being wary of holes and a time limit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
