Players control an avatar that must navigate through a level filled with walls, obstacles, and other interactive elements to reach an exit.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - **Floor**: Generally serves as a navigable area.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character can move and interact with other elements.\n   - **Box**: A movable object that interacts with the avatar and other obstacles.\n   - **Exit**: This is the goal; reaching it earns points.\n   - **Hole**: Avoiding holes is crucial as they can eliminate the avatar and involve a score penalty.\n   - **Wall**: Immoveable barriers that restrict movement.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar bounces back when it collides with walls.\n   - The avatar can push the box forward.\n   - Boxes can be used to interact with walls and the exit, but improper placement can undo actions or lead to loss conditions.\n   - Falling into holes results in a score decrease.\n   - Reaching the exit leads to a success condition with a score increase.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to navigate the avatar through the level, avoiding holes and using the boxes wisely to reach the exit. The player must earn enough points by reaching the exit while avoiding score penalties.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully reach the exit (score +1) when there are still avatars present.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - If all avatars are eliminated (score -1).\n  - If the timer runs out (1000 ticks).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Your Movements**:\n   - Before moving, analyze the layout. Identify the position of walls, boxes, holes, and the exit.\n   - Determine how you can utilize boxes to create a path to the exit or to eliminate obstacles.\n\n2. **Careful Box Management**:\n   - Use boxes strategically to block holes or create pathways.\n   - Be mindful of interacting with walls; pushing a box into a wall can undo your efforts.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes**:\n   - Watch your stepping carefully; avoid moving into holes at all costs as they result in penalties and can quickly lead to a game over.\n\n4. **Keep an Eye on the Timer**:\n   - The time limit is a critical aspect of your strategy. Plan your moves and execute them with efficiency to escape the level before the timer runs out.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with box placements and movements. Learning from failures will typically provide insight into better tactics.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through the levels more effectively, maximize their scores, and ultimately achieve the win condition of reaching the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

    "content": "To decide the action, let's first analyze the current state of the game layout.\n\n1. **Avatar's Position**: The avatar is currently at (row=5, col=3).\n2. **Exit Location**: The exit is at (row=1, col=1).\n3. **Walls**: The walls are represented by `%`, and are present around the avatar and throughout the level.\n4. **Holes**: The holes `$` are present, notably at (row=3, col=8) and (row=4, col=1) that should be avoided to prevent penalties.\n\n### Current Map Context:\n```\nrow=5: % . @ @ @ @ . @ @ %\nrow=4: % $ $ $ @ @ . @ . @\nrow=3: % . . @ @ . @ @ $ @\nrow=2: % . . @ . @ % % @ @\nrow=1: % # . . @ @ @ . . %\n```\n\n### Available Actions:\n- **ACTION_NIL (0)**: No change\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Move left to (5, 2)\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move right to (5, 4)\n- **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Move down to (6, 3)\n- **ACTION_UP (4)**: Move up to (4, 3)\n\n### Potential Movement Analysis:\n1. If I move **LEFT (1)** to (5, 2):\n   - The space contains a box (`@`), which is a valid move.\n   \n2. If I move **RIGHT (2)** to (5, 4):\n   - This space is also a box (`@`), so it's valid.\n   \n3. If I move **DOWN (3)** to (6, 3):\n   - This space is also a box (`@`), thus valid.\n   \n4. If I move **UP (4)** to (4, 3):\n   - There is a box here as well (`@`) but moving to higher rows may help me progress towards the exit.\n\n### Best Action Decision:\nGiven the current state, I want to move the avatar strategically closer to the exit while managing boxes. Moving **UP (4)** to (4, 3) will allow me to stay directly involved with the boxes and potentially create a clearer path towards the exit in subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up should help analyze the overall setup better and prepare for future moves toward the exit.",
