Players manipulate objects within a grid-based layout, using their avatar to interact with various elements like walls, boxes, exits, and holes.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes**: Movable objects that can be used to block pathways or activate exits.\n   - **Wall**: Immoveable barriers that define the boundaries of the level.\n   - **Exit**: A goal that the player must reach to complete the level.\n   - **Hole**: A hazard that results in the loss of points if the avatar interacts with it.\n   - **Floor**: The underlying surface where interactions take place.\n  \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Collision with walls causes the avatar to step back, preventing movement through walls.\n   - Interaction with a box allows the avatar to bounce forward, indicating that boxes can push the avatar or be used to navigate space.\n   - Boxes cannot move through exits, but they can block access.\n   - Falling into a hole results in a score penalty (-1).\n   - Reaching the exit results in a score gain (+1).\n   - If a box falls into a hole, it is removed from the game.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends with a win condition if the exit sprite count reaches 0 (indicating the exit has been accessed).\n   - The game results in a loss if the avatar count reaches zero or if time runs out (1000 units).\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to the exit while avoiding holes and managing the positioning of boxes. The player must reach the exit before running out of time to achieve a score gain.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: Successfully reach the exit leading to a score increase. \n- **Loss**: \n  - The avatar is killed or lost (SpriteCounter reaches zero).\n  - The player runs out of time.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Planning Moves**: Before moving, observe the layout and potential routes to the exit. Use the boxes strategically to block holes or create pathways.\n  \n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Stay cautious around holes. Do not move out of safety unless necessary, as falling into a hole incurs a score penalty.\n\n3. **Utilizing Boxes**: Use boxes effectively to create obstacles for yourself or manipulate paths that lead to the exit. They are key for maneuvering around walls while accommodating the exit route.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Make swift decisions and prioritize paths that lead to the exit while avoiding unnecessary movements that might lead to time loss.\n\n5. **Experiment with Interactions**: If stuck, try different interactions with the boxes and walls. For example, bouncing off a box can provide unexpected movement options.\n\n6. **Visual Map Assessment**: Regularly evaluate the space around the avatar and frequently assess which paths are still open and which are blocked, both by walls and boxes.\n\nBy effectively managing these strategies, players can navigate through the level systematically while maximizing their score and minimizing the risk of falling into hazards or hitting time constraints.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
