You control a rat-like avatar that must navigate a grid-based labyrinth. The layout is built with immovable walls, holes that are deadly if stepped on by your avatar, and boxes that can interact with both the avatar and other level elements. There\u2019s also an exit door (depicted as cheese) that, when touched, is removed from the maze; clearing it is the win condition.\n\nKey points of the game:\n\n\u2022 Game Genre & Style  \n\u2003\u2013 A grid-based puzzle maze  \n\u2003\u2013 Some box-pushing dynamics that affect the environment\n\n\u2022 Mechanics  \n\u2003\u2013 The avatar moves around the grid but is blocked by walls (touching a wall makes the avatar step back).  \n\u2003\u2013 Boxes are passive objects that can be bounced forward by the avatar.  \n\u2003\u2013 If a box collides with walls or the exit in a particular chain reaction (\u201cbox wall exit box\u201d), an undo effect occurs (likely resetting some elements of the puzzle).  \n\u2003\u2013 Stepping into a hole kills your avatar (with a score penalty) while stepping on the exit kills (removes) the exit sprite and gives a score bonus. Moving a box into a hole simply makes it vanish.\n\n\u2022 Objectives & Conditions  \n\u2003\u2013 The overall goal is to clear the level by eliminating all exit sprites (i.e. stepping on them with your avatar), which signals a win.  \n\u2003\u2013 Conversely, losing all avatar life (through death by holes or similar hazards) or running out of time (the level has a timeout limit) causes you to lose.\n\n\u2022 Suggested Overall Strategy  \n\u20031. Study the Maze: Examine your starting position relative to walls, holes, boxes, and the exit door. Identify the safest path that avoids dangerous holes.  \n\u20032. Plan Your Moves: Think ahead about how each movement might cause boxes to slide or bounce, potentially triggering unwanted chain reactions (especially since interactions involving boxes, walls, and the exit can undo previous moves).  \n\u20033. Use Caution with Boxes: If boxes are in your way, use them strategically\u2014bouncing them forward could clear your path or, if misused, create an undo situation that forces you to rethink your route.  \n\u20034. Move Methodically: Advance step-by-step\u2014avoid rushing into traps or holes. The avatar\u2019s interaction with the exit (removing it to win) means that making contact with the exit is your final objective, so approach it only when you\u2019re sure the path is safe.  \n\u20035. Time Management: With a timeout limit, it\u2019s important to solve the puzzle efficiently, so plan and execute your moves with foresight.\n\nOverall, the key is to carefully chart your course through the maze, manage your interactions with boxes and avoid fatal pitfalls (holes), until you can safely eliminate the exit door and win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
