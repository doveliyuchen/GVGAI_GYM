You control a moving avatar that must navigate a maze\u2010like level full of obstacles, movable blocks (\u201cboxes\u201d), fixed walls, deadly holes, and one or more \u201cexit\u201d doors that act as the level\u2019s goal.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 The avatar can move around the grid but is blocked by walls (stepping into a wall simply bounces you back).\n\u2003\u2013 There are boxes you can interact with. If a box bumps into the avatar, it \u201cbounces\u201d the avatar forward. In some cases, boxes interact with walls and exits in a way that performs a special \u201cundoAll\u201d action (possibly resetting parts of the board or your moves).\n\u2003\u2013 Holes are dangerous. If your avatar goes into a hole, it is killed (with a penalty to your score), so you must steer clear. Boxes, however, disappear when they end up in a hole.\n\u2003\u2013 Exits function as your target. When the avatar touches an exit, it is removed (and your score increases) and when all exit sprites are gone the game ends with a win.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your goal is to guide the avatar so it eventually comes into contact with an exit. Because the game \u201cwins\u201d when no exit sprites remain, you must ultimately trigger the exit-activation event.\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is eliminated (for example, by falling into a hole) or you run out of moves (with a timeout set to 1000 turns).\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Analyze the level layout to determine the safest, most efficient path to the exit while avoiding holes. Plan your route carefully.\n\u2003\u2013 Use the boxes strategically. Sometimes pushing them might open up new paths or stop you from falling into a pit. Remember that their interactions\u2014especially with walls and exits\u2014might allow you to \u201cundo\u201d or reset a mistaken move.\n\u2003\u2013 Keep in mind that every move counts, so try not to get cornered or forced into a risky move that puts you near a hole. Move methodically, and if you mess up, see if the board\u2019s \u201cundoAll\u201d mechanic (triggered by a specific box\u2013wall\u2013exit sequence) can help you reverse errors.\n\u2003\u2013 Always check your surroundings before stepping, because one wrong move (like touching a hole) ends the game.\n\nIn summary, this is a thoughtful maze/puzzle game where careful movement and the creative use of movable blocks are key. The trick is to navigate around hazards and use the environment to guide the avatar safely to the exit. Happy puzzling!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
