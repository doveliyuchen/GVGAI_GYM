It combines elements of puzzle-solving with platform mechanics, where players must navigate a character through a maze while avoiding hazards and manipulating objects to reach an exit.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features different types of sprites: \n  - **Floor:** A solid ground you can walk on.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that moves and interacts with other sprites.\n  - **Box:** An object that can be pushed or used to interact with other sprites (like a wall or exit).\n  - **Exit:** The target area the player must reach to win.\n  - **Hole:** A hazard that, if the avatar or box falls into, results in a score penalty or loss of the box.\n  - **Wall:** Impassable barriers that require careful navigation.\n  \n- **Interactions:** Various interactions define how the avatar and boxes behave in the game world.\n  - If the avatar hits a wall, they step back.\n  - If the avatar bumps into a box, it pushes the box forward.\n  - If a box collides with a wall or exit, it can undo the relevant action (probably resetting the movement).\n  - Falling into a hole or the exit gives points or penalizes accordingly.\n  \n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the \"exit\" sprite while managing the box and avoiding hazards like holes. The player must strategically push the box to navigate the level effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit (exit sprite count reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game results in a loss if the avatar's count reaches 0 or a timeout condition triggers (after 1000 units of time).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Layout:** Understand the level design, and identify the locations of walls, holes, and exits. Observe where you can push the box to open pathways or interact with the exit.\n  \n2. **Plan Moves:** Before moving the avatar or the box, plan the series of interactions. Avoid forcing the box into a position where it might fall into a hole or become wedged against a wall upon a subsequent move.\n\n3. **Use the Box Wisely:** Leverage the box to create pathways. For instance, place the box strategically to block holes or to bridge gaps leading to the exit. Be cautious not to accidentally retreat or reset the box's position by colliding with walls.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards:** Keep an eye on holes; they can quickly lead to a negative score and potentially lose the box, impacting your ability to reach the exit.\n\n5. **Manage Time Wisely:** Make calculated moves to keep under the time limit. Be aware of the time remaining as you explore and solve the puzzles to ensure you don't run out of time.\n\nBy balancing exploration, puzzle-solving, and careful actions, players can navigate through this challenging puzzle platformer and reach the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

    "content": "Looking at the current map state, your avatar ('a') is located at (row 5, col 3). To reach the exit ('#') at (row 1, col 1), you need to clear a path and push boxes ('@') appropriately, while avoiding any holes ('$').\n\nCurrently, the boxes can be pushed and manipulated to open pathways toward the exit. The significant actions available around the avatar\u2019s position are as follows:\n- Moving left to (5, 2) (which contains a box '@').\n- Moving right to (5, 4) (which contains another box '@').\n- Moving up to (4, 3) (which contains a box '@').\n- Moving down to (6, 3) (which also contains a box '@').\n\nTo make an effective move based on the strategies outlined, the next action should be pushing one of the boxes to create a path. \n\nMoving up to (4, 3) to push the box located there seems like a strategic option. After moving the box, it could potentially assist in further moves towards the exit.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move up to push the box at (4, 3).\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is a strategic decision to push the box at (4, 3) closer to creating a path toward the exit and is in line with the overall strategy. I aim to see if this opens new pathways in the subsequent state.",
