Genre and Style:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game with elements reminiscent of classic \u201cpush\u201d puzzles (think Sokoban) and maze runners. You play as a moving character (an \u201cavatar\u201d) in a level filled with obstacles and interactable objects.\n\n2. Key Game Objects and Their Roles:\n\u2003\u2022 Floor \u2013 The basic background tiles you move on.\n\u2003\u2022 Walls \u2013 Solid barriers that stop your movement. Running into a wall makes your avatar \u201cstep back\u201d to its previous position.\n\u2003\u2022 Avatar \u2013 The player\u2019s character (a rat), which you guide around the level.\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes \u2013 Passive objects that can interact with the avatar. If a box meets the avatar, it \u201cbounces forward\u201d (possibly nudging things into action). They can also interact with walls and the exit in a way that causes all moves to be undone, suggesting that moving boxes incorrectly might force you to retry your strategy.\n\u2003\u2022 Exit \u2013 A door (depicted as cheese and colored green) that is the key to winning. When the avatar touches it, the exit is \u201ckilled\u201d (or removed) and you gain a point. The win condition is tied to the exit disappearing.\n\u2003\u2022 Holes \u2013 Dangerous spots (colored dark blue) that serve as portals. If your avatar goes into a hole, it\u2019s killed (with a score penalty). A box falling into a hole is simply removed.\n\n3. How You Win or Lose:\n\u2003\u2022 You lose immediately if your avatar is killed (for example, by falling into a hole).\n\u2003\u2022 You also lose if you run out of time\u2014the level has a move or time limit (1000 steps/units).\n\u2003\u2022 You win once the exit disappears (meaning the avatar has reached and \u201cused\u201d it), as indicated by the exit sprite count reaching zero.\n\n4. How the Game Plays (Mechanics):\n\u2003\u2022 Movement is grid-based. You must navigate the maze-like layout while abiding by the interactions.\n\u2003\u2022 Collisions matter: bumping into a wall forces a \u201cstep back,\u201d so you must plan your moves.\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes offer both help and hindrance. They bounce when contacting your avatar and might undo progress if they touch both walls and the exit at once. Handling these objects carefully is part of the challenge.\n\u2003\u2022 Holes are hazards. You have to steer clear with your avatar, while boxes might vanish if they fall in.\n\u2003\u2022 Reaching the exit (the cheese door) is the primary goal, but you must do so without triggering any fatal interactions.\n\n5. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Plan your route: Look at the level layout and avoid the holes while figuring out the best way to reach the exit.\n\u2003\u2022 Manage boxes carefully: Since boxes interact with both the avatar and key elements like walls and the exit (with potentially undoing moves), think ahead about how moving a box might affect your path or force you to recalibrate.\n\u2003\u2022 Be cautious with movement: Avoid running directly into walls or holes; each move counts due to the move limit.\n\u2003\u2022 Experiment cautiously: If pushing a box near a wall or exit might \u201cundo all\u201d moves, you might need to adjust your strategy before committing.\n\u2003\u2022 Keep track of objectives: Since touching the exit removes it (and triggers the win), navigate there only when you\u2019re sure the path is safe and won\u2019t provoke unintended interactions.\n\u2003\u2022 Optimize your moves: With a timeout condition looming, it\u2019s important to move efficiently and avoid unnecessary repetitions.\n\nIn summary, this puzzle game challenges you to carefully navigate a maze, handle obstacles like walls and holes, and thoughtfully manipulate boxes\u2014all while racing against a move limit\u2014to ultimately reach the exit and secure a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%#..@@@...@.%\n%a.@@@%%@@@.%\n%@...@@@$@..%\n%$$$...@..@@%\n%%%...@@@.@@%\n%.@@..@@.$@.%\n%.@.@...@.@.%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\n%%%%%%%%%\n%..%$@a#%\n%@@%$...%\n%.@.$.@.%\n%@....@@%\n%....@@@%\n%.@@.@%@%\n%.@@@@%.%\n%@.@.$@.%\n%.$..@@.%\n%@@@@.@@%\n%..@@...%\n%%%%%%%%%\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> a\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
