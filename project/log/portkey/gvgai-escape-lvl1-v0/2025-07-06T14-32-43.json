    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle, Sokoban-like.\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar pushes boxes around.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Players must plan moves to navigate boxes through a maze-like environment.\n*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** Holes are dangerous and must be avoided.\n*   **Portals:** Holes have 'portal=True' which suggests avatar goes to some other location on the board when they go in it.\n*   **Limited Movement:** The `stepBack` interaction suggests the avatar cannot move through walls.\n*   **Undoing:** There is a possibility of undoing all moves in certain conditions, namely, pushing box in a corner of wall, wall, exit, and another box.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Guide the avatar to the exit (cheese).\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   All exits (cheese) are gone (presumably because the avatar reached them), as indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0 win=True`.\n\n**Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   The avatar is removed from the board, as indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False` and the avatar can be removed from the board when it goes into a hole (score decrease) or after reaching the exit (score increase). This suggests that there is one instance of the avatar, the single one that appears in the board.\n*   Timeout: The player runs out of moves (reaches the time limit of 1000).\n\n**Sprites:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player-controlled character (a rat).\n*   **Box:** Pushable objects.\n*   **Exit:** The goal (cheese).\n*   **Hole:** A hazard that leads to avatar removal (score decrease). Holes might be portals that lead to other parts of the board.\n*   **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **Floor:** Hidden tiles, the board's ground.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   Walls form a maze.\n*   Boxes are strategically placed to block or direct the player.\n*   Holes are placed to penalize movement.\n*   Exits are the goal.\n\n**Possible Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban games require careful planning. Consider the consequences of each move.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Getting a box stuck in a corner is a common mistake that can make a level unsolvable, although the rule about undoing movements may help with this.\n3.  **Prioritize Exits:** Focus on clearing paths to the exits first.\n4.  **Utilize Holes Carefully (If Portal):** If the hole is a portal, understand where it leads and use it to your advantage. If not, avoid them.\n5.  **Manage Score:** The game has scoring, with holes reducing the score and exits increasing it. So you will want to avoid holes.\n\n**In summary:** This is a classic puzzle game where you push boxes to clear a path for your avatar to reach the exits. Strategic planning and careful execution are key to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
