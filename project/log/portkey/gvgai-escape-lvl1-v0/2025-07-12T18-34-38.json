It combines platforming mechanics with puzzle-solving elements, where the player must navigate through a maze-like environment filled with obstacles and interactive elements.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor**: Provides a base for movement.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move about the level.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be moved to interact with other elements.\n   - **Exit**: The goal of the level, represented by a green door (indicating success).\n   - **Hole**: A detrimental space that will lead to a score decrease if the avatar falls into it.\n   - **Wall**: Blocking structures that prevent movement through them.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The **avatar cannot move through walls** but can push boxes.\n   - The **box interacts with the avatar and walls** in ways that influence movement; when the avatar collides with a box, it moves forward, but it can undo actions when a box touches the wall or exit.\n   - Landing in a **hole results in negative scoring**.\n   - Reaching the **exit gives positive scoring**, which is essential for winning.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends if the avatar is lost (through a death mechanic) or all exit conditions are met.\n   - There is a time limit of 1000 units, potentially enforcing a fast-paced decision-making aspect.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal of the game is to get the avatar to the exit while avoiding the holes and making strategic use of the boxes to navigate obstacles and achieve this objective.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions**: Reach the exit with the avatar, while managing the score (maximum of 1 point awarded upon exit).\n- **Loss Conditions**: If the avatar is lost (zero sprites remaining), or if the timer runs out.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan the Route**: Start by assessing the level layout. Identify the positions of boxes, holes, walls, and the exit. Determine the best route that minimizes potential hazards.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use boxes to create paths or push them into walls to manipulate their positions effectively. Ensure boxes don't end up in holes or lead you to unintended consequences.\n\n3. **Avoid the Holes**: Since falling into holes results in a score loss, be cautious while navigating. Double-check your movement before executing actions.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep track of the 1000-unit timer to avoid a time-out. Prioritize efficient movements and strategize your steps ahead of time.\n\n5. **Iterative Approach**: If you make a mistake, use the \u201cundo\u201d mechanic wisely. Sometimes, backtracking can be advantageous to reassess your situation and find a better path to the exit.\n\n6. **Explore and Experiment**: If stuck, use a trial-and-error method with the boxes and movement to uncover hidden solutions or pathways.\n\nBy effectively utilizing the mechanics, understanding the level layout, and being mindful of interactions, players can successfully navigate to the exit while managing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

Since we are currently on row 5 and want to reach the exit on row 1, we need to analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. The upward direction (ACTION_UP to (row=4, col=3)) leads us to a box position (@) which can potentially be moved.\n2. The left and right (ACTION_LEFT and ACTION_RIGHT) options do not offer immediate paths as the left is blocked by walls and the right leads to another box which may not help in advancing upward.\n\nGiven that the avatar must reach row 1 and since the upward move (row=4, col=3) provides an option to manipulate the boxes for further upward movement, I will choose:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up is key to getting closer to the exit while allowing for potential box manipulation on subsequent turns.",
