Players are required to solve spatial puzzles, navigate obstacles, and interact with elements to progress through the level.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are several types of sprites (game objects):\n   - **Floor**: Serves as the base/platform.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move within the level.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be pushed by the avatar but has passive properties.\n   - **Exit**: A target that the avatar needs to reach for winning.\n   - **Hole**: A hazard that leads to losing a score.\n   - **Wall**: Impassable barriers that influence movement.\n\n2. **Interactions**: Different interactions define how the player's avatar and other sprites interact:\n   - Moving into walls causes the avatar to step back.\n   - The avatar will bounce forward when colliding with a box.\n   - Running into a hole results in a negative score.\n   - Reaching the exit results in a positive score.\n   - Boxes disappearing or interacting with holes or walls causes undesirable outcomes.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar is eliminated (or scores negative points) or if a timer runs out.\n   - The game is won by reaching the exit without falling into a hole.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to **navigate the avatar through the level, manipulate boxes, avoid hazards (holes), and ultimately reach the exit**. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The game is won when the avatar successfully interacts with the exit sprite.\n- **Losing**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated by falling into holes or if time runs out before reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before moving, observe the layout and identify potential paths to the exit. Note the locations of holes and walls to avoid traps.\n\n2. **Box Utilization**: Utilize boxes to navigate through walls. The bouncing interaction can potentially be used to access higher ground or redirect movement.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of the holes, as colliding with them results in a score deduction, which could lead to an early loss. Anticipate their locations in your route planning.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep track of the timer. Ensure that you\u2019re making efficient movements to avoid wasting time, which is also a potential loss condition.\n\n5. **Experiment with Patterns**: In difficult sections, experiment with different box placements or bounce techniques to find a viable route to the exit.\n\nIn summary, the game requires careful planning and strategy focused on avoiding hazards and effectively using boxes to navigate around obstacles toward the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n- The goal is to reach '#' (exit) at position (1, 1).\n- The avatar can interact with boxes ('@') to manipulate them to create pathways; these are located at various positions around.\n- The walls ('%') block movement.\n- Hazards ('$') are present on certain squares that should be avoided.\n\n**Current Obstacles:** \nThe walls surrounding the exit create a challenge, as direct routes are blocked. The exit itself is above and requires careful navigation to slide or bounce boxes if necessary.\n\n**Plan:**\nTo get closer to the exit, I need to find a direct route avoiding holes and walls while potentially manipulating boxes to assist my movement.\n\nFor my first action, I will attempt to move **up** to position (4, 3), where there is a box present. This might allow me to push a box into a different position, creating a more favorable route later.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should move the avatar upwards, placing it adjacent to a box to strategize further moves efficiently. I expect this action to help with positioning for future box pushes.",
