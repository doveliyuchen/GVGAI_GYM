It incorporates elements of navigation, obstacles, and spatial reasoning, where the player must figure out how to move through a level and interact with various objects to reach the exit.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: The basic terrain where the avatar can move.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that navigates the level.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be pushed or used for various interactions.\n   - **Exit**: The goal of the level, providing a score increment when reached.\n   - **Hole**: An impediment that negatively impacts the score and can lead to the end of the game if interacted improperly.\n   - **Wall**: Barriers that prevent movement through certain areas.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls and will step back if it tries.\n   - The avatar can bounce off of boxes, suggesting a need to think about the trajectory and angles when pushing boxes.\n   - Boxes can interact with walls and exits, with a specific undo mechanism if boxes are improperly placed.\n   - If the avatar falls into a hole, it results in a score deduction and immediate loss of the avatar.\n   - The exit allows the avatar to end the level and gain points.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - Losing the avatar (all avatars are eliminated) results in a loss.\n   - Successfully reaching the exit, while ensuring no avatars remain, results in a win.\n   - A timeout condition must be managed to avoid losing by failing to complete the level within the given moves.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate the level, utilizing the box and avoiding holes to reach the exit sprite. Players need to maintain at least one avatar while strategically moving boxes to clear the path to the exit.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if they manage to navigate and reach the exit sprite, which also requires that at least one avatar remains.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if all avatars are eliminated or if they fail to complete the level within the time limit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Path Planning**: Before moving, plan a clear path to the exit while avoiding holes and walls. Assess multiple routes and visualize box placement to create viable pathways.\n\n2. **Box Utilization**: Use boxes strategically to create platforms or barriers to avoid holes. Since boxes can bounce the avatar, think about how to angle movements to reach necessary locations.\n\n3. **Avoiding Holes**: Be cautious of holes; avoiding them is critical since they can eliminate the avatar. Position the boxes to block access to holes or to assist in reaching otherwise hard-to-reach areas.\n\n4. **Manage Time Efficiently**: Since there\u2019s a timeout condition, maintain a balance between taking actions that allow you to think and strategizing your moves to complete the level in the allotted time.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**: If the game allows it, utilize trial and error when learning the interactions between the avatar, boxes, and other sprites. Resetting your position may be necessary if a move leads to a dead end.\n\nBy systematically applying these strategies while paying attention to the interactions and sprite mechanics, players should be able to improve their chances of successfully completing the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%#..@@@...@.%\n%..@.@%%@@@.%\n%..@@.@@$@..%\n%$$$@@.@..@@%\n%%%a.@@@@.@@%\n%.@@...@.$@.%\n%.@.@...@.@.%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\n%%%%%%%%%\n%..%$..#%\n%@@%$...%\n%.@a$@@.%\n%@..@@.@%\n%..@@.@@%\n%..@.@%@%\n%.@@@@%.%\n%@.@.$@.%\n%.$..@@.%\n%@@@@.@@%\n%..@@...%\n%%%%%%%%%",

    "content": "In the current state, my avatar ('a') is positioned directly above a hole ('$'), making it imperative to act quickly to avoid falling into it. The immediate surroundings consist of a wall on the left and several boxes ('1') directly beneath. To avoid losing the avatar by falling into the hole, I need to ensure a safe movement.\n\n### Current Position\n- Current position of the avatar: `(5, 2)`\n- Immediate below the avatar: `(6, 2)` which is a hole ('$')\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the immediate threat of falling into a hole, I must move the avatar up or to the side to maintain my position safely. Since there are walls to the left and right directly adjacent to my avatar, the only viable movement without dropping directly into the hole is to move **upwards**.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action represents moving up, which is necessary to avoid the hole below while keeping the avatar safe. I anticipate that this aligns with the strategy of avoiding danger and maintaining my avatar on safe terrain.",
