    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and a strategic suggestion.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to fall under the **puzzle-platformer** genre. It involves strategic movement and interactions within an obstacle course layout, leveraging various game elements (sprites) to solve a problem and reach an exit.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - **Avatar**: The main character the player controls, represented by an image (knight).\n   - **Boxes**: Passive objects that can interact with the avatar and other sprites.\n   - **Walls and Floor**: Immoveable obstacles that define the playable area.\n   - **Holes**: Points where boxes can interact for point scoring.\n   - **Doors**: Serve as entry and exit points; some doors are locked and require certain conditions to open.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar bounces off walls and boxes, can push boxes to interact with holes, and passes through the exit.\n   - Different configuration of boxes and holes provides varying scores.\n   - Certain interactions cause \u2018killing\u2019 of sprites, suggesting they are removed from play, possibly affecting scores or gameplay state.\n\n3. **Scoring System**: \n   - Score is determined by the type of interaction with boxes and holes.\n   - The more strategic the use of boxes with respect to holes, the higher the score.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate from the start point to the exit while maximizing the score through interacting with boxes and holes. Additionally, you must ensure that the exit (exit sprite) is activated to win.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no exit sprites left (SpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the time limit of 1000 counts down to zero before achieving the win condition.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Planning Movements**: Given that the avatar only interacts in certain ways with boxes and holes, plan out movements carefully. Use the available boxes as tools to manipulate the environment effectively.\n\n2. **Maximizing Score**: Prioritize using boxes on holes that provide the highest score before heading towards the exit. The highest score holes yield a score of up to 8 points, and the exit yields a massive 16 points.\n\n3. **Efficient Use of Time**: Keep an eye on the timer and act efficiently. Focus on strategic movements that maximize points without getting bogged down by unnecessary actions or missteps.\n\n4. **Understanding Board Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout in order to preemptively identify pathways and possible box placements that can help navigate towards the exit.\n\n5. **Utilize Walls Wisely**: Since the avatar bounces off walls when moving, positioning boxes in relation to walls can help create pathways and clear routes towards the exit or more advantageous hole interactions.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game, achieve a high score, and successfully reach the exit within the time limit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> c\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> e\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> d\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> w\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> a\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> %\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> f\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",
