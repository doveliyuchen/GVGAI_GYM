This is characterized by the need to solve puzzles in order to advance through levels while navigating a character through various obstacles.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar (the player character) can move around the game environment, interact with other sprites such as walls, boxes, and holes.\n- **Boxes:** There are different types of boxes that can interact with holes to provide score changes or trigger events. The boxes can be moved or manipulated to achieve certain goals.\n- **Holes:** These are points where boxes can be placed. Each hole corresponds to a different score value based on the box used.\n- **Doors:** There are closed and open doors, which likely serve as entry and exit points in the game. Closed doors must be interacted with or opened to proceed.\n- **Walls:** These barriers prevent movement, necessitating strategy to navigate around them.\n- **Scoring System:** The player can earn points by correctly interacting boxes with holes and reaching the exit.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to unlock and reach the exit while maximizing score. This requires strategically placing the boxes in the correct holes to achieve the highest possible score before opening the exit.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if the sprite counter for the exit type (exit/spriteCounter) reaches zero, meaning the player has successfully navigated to the exit. \n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the timer runs out (timeout limit reaches 0), suggesting players must solve the puzzle and exit within the given time.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Layout:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout and where obstacles, exits, and boxes are located. Identify which holes can be interacted with to maximize scoring potential.\n\n2. **Plan Box Placement:** Carefully consider which boxes to place in which holes based on their score value. Higher score holes yield better results, so prioritize those when planning moves.\n\n3. **Minimize Movement:** Remember that moving the avatar against walls or doors can lead to setbacks (step back) and bouncing off boxes can also disrupt your strategy. Try to create a plan that minimizes unnecessary movements.\n\n4. **Use the Timer Wisely:** Keep an eye on the timer. Work efficiently to solve each puzzle without rushing but be mindful that time is limited.\n\n5. **Experiment with Interactions:** If you\u2019re stuck, try different interactions with boxes and walls. Seeing how they affect the game can lead to new strategies.\n\n6. **Reassess After Each Move:** After placing each box or moving the avatar, reassess the new situation before proceeding. Each change could open up new possibilities or reveal new challenges.\n\nBy following these strategies while focusing on the game's objectives, players can navigate challenges more effectively and work towards achieving a higher score before reaching the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> c\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> e\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> d\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> w\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> h\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> %\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> f\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, let's identify the relevant information:\n\n- The avatar (`a`) is located at position (8, 2).\n- There are boxes (`@`) at position (8, 1) and (`%`) at (9, 9).\n- The exits are represented by `e` at (5, 8).\n- The closest hole available is (`h`) at (9, 5), which can hold items providing some scoring potential.\n\nThe main goal is to reach the exit while maximizing points through strategic use of boxes and holes. Since there's a box above the avatar, it's important to consider moving it since actions might revolve around optimizing box placements.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Understanding Movements:** The avatar can either move left to handle the box (`@` at (8,1)) or right. Since moving right from position (8,2) leads to open space and does not interact with anything significant, I should consider moving left to deal with the box.\n \n2. **Action Selection:** It\u2019s imperative to move to encounter the box first to consider placement options. The first step should likely be moving left.\n\nGiven the above understanding, I will proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to position (8, 1) allows us to interact with the box and will likely set up chain moves to maximize the score efficiently.",
