The player guides an avatar (likely a chef) through a series of interactions to accomplish specific tasks and achieve goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Player Avatar:** The avatar is a moving character controlled by the player.\n- **Interaction with Sprites:** The game involves various sprites (items) including ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna), cooking tools (boiling water), and game objects (key, lock).\n- **Transformations:** Different combinations of ingredients and cooking tools result in transformations that can either yield a positive score (correct cooking) or a negative score (wrong placements).\n- **Single-use Resource:** There is a key that can unlock a lock, but only if the avatar has it and the conditions are met.\n- **Environmental Hazards:** The walls and the far-right side of the level restrict the movement, forcing the player to navigate carefully.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The objective of the game is to transform ingredients into the final dish (represented as `plateinplace`) by combining them correctly while avoiding incorrect placements (represented as `wrongplace`).\n- The player needs to collect the key and use it to unlock areas, while avoiding placing items incorrectly to prevent losing points.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- You win the game if you can create at least one `plateinplace`.\n- You lose the game if you make an incorrect placement of any ingredient (one `wrongplace` sprite results in a loss).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Before interacting with ingredients, plan the order in which you will combine them to maximize your score and avoid wrong placements.\n  \n2. **Focus on Resources:** Prioritize collecting the key as it allows you to unlock new areas. Be careful before interacting with the lock as it may result in losing the key if you have a better item in hand.\n  \n3. **Combine Correctly:** Here are some key interaction combinations to focus on:\n   - Combine `rawpasta` with `boilingwater` first to get `pastainplace`.\n   - Combine `tomato` with `tuna` next to create `sauceinplace`.\n   - Finally, combine `pastainplace` with `sauceinplace` to get your final dish (`plateinplace`).\n  \n4. **Avoid Wrong Combinations:** Keep track of which combinations lead to `wrongplace`, as they halt progress and lead to losing the game. Avoid mixing ingredients that do not belong together.\n\n5. **Scouting the Map:** Make sure to explore the environment to find all gameplay elements, especially the sequence and possible additional items or obstacles. Movement towards the wall and lock with an available key is critical for unlocking further routes.\n\nIn conclusion, by understanding the mechanics and systematic strategies, players can efficiently achieve their goal within the constraints provided by the interactions and object placements in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> a\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is positioned at (8, 3). \n\nThe immediate surroundings are as follows:\n- To the left (8, 2): empty floor (.)\n- To the right (8, 4): empty floor (.)\n- Up (7, 3): raw pasta (%)\n- Down (9, 3): empty floor (.)\n\nThe main goal is to transform the ingredients properly to create the final dish. Since the next immediate interaction can be with the raw pasta located directly above you (7, 3), it would be beneficial to move upward to collect it, as it is an essential ingredient for making the dish.\n\nBased on the provided strategy, let's take the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will move the avatar up to (7, 3) where the raw pasta (represented by %) is located, which is a critical step towards creating a dish and aligns perfectly with the strategy to gather necessary resources.",
