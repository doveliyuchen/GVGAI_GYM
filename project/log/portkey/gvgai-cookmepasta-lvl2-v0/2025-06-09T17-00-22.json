The player must solve spatial and resource-based challenges while managing ingredients to create a specific dish.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \nPlayers control an 'avatar' (a chef) that interacts with various sprites or objects, such as ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna), tools (boiling water), and obstacles (walls, locks). The game mechanics allow the avatar to combine items to create a final dish while avoiding incorrect combinations. \n\nSpecific mechanics present:\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move within the bounds of the level.\n- **Resource Management:** Players must collect a key to unlock specific areas and must carefully choose which ingredients to combine to achieve a successful dish.\n- **Scoring System:** Combinations yield points (both positive and negative), impacting the player\u2019s score based on the success or failure of ingredient interactions.\n- **Transformation:** Ingredients change into various states (cooked, in place, etc.) based on interactions with the avatar and other sprites.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to create a \"plateinplace\" by correctly combining ingredients and tools. This involves strategically using the boiling water, raw pasta, and other ingredients to achieve the final dish.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \nA player wins if there is one instance of \"plateinplace.\" However, if there is one instance of \"wrongplace,\" the player loses. Therefore, players must be careful with their combinations and the order in which they interact with various items.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Before moving, visualize the possible interactions. Always consider how each step affects your score and advancement toward the final dish.\n\n2. **Gather Ingredients Wisely:**\n   - Start by collecting the key to unlock more areas, but focus on gathering the necessary ingredients first (raw pasta, tomato, tuna).\n\n3. **Combine Correctly:**\n   - The goal is to transform the raw pasta into \"pastainplace\" and combine it with \"sauceinplace\" to create the \"plateinplace.\" \n   - Avoid combinations that lead to \"wrongplace\", which will negatively affect your score and lead to a loss if not managed carefully.\n\n4. **Use Boiling Water Smartly:**\n   - Boiling water is essential for transforming raw pasta. Make sure to have the pasta ready before attempting to interact with boiling water.\n\n5. **Avoid Locks and Walls:**\n   - Navigate carefully to avoid getting stuck behind walls or locks. The lock prevents you from moving forward without the key, so manage your key collection effectively.\n\n6. **Monitor Score Changes:**\n   - Keep track of your score throughout the game. Attempt to maximize positive score interactions while minimizing negative ones.\n\n7. **Practice Patience:**\n   - If you encounter a combination that leads to a loss state, take your time to rethink your strategy and try different paths to avoid \"wrongplace\" interactions.\n\nThis strategy should help guide players toward creating the final dish while minimizing mistakes and maximizing their score!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> a\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
