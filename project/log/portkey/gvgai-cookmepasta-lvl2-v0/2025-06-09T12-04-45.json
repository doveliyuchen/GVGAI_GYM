Here\u2019s a breakdown of its components:\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Puzzle/Strategy**: The game revolves around solving the spatial relationships and interactions between various ingredients in order to achieve a specific outcome.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Each sprite represents either static or moving elements within the game, including the player (the avatar, a chef), various ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna), cooking elements (boiling water), and placement elements (sauce in place, plate in place).\n- **Interactions**: The game involves various interactions between the avatar and the sprites. For example, cooking raw pasta requires boiling, and combining tomato with tuna makes sauce. Additionally, there are mechanics for scoring and penalties based on mixing incompatible items.\n\n### Objective\n- The primary objective is to create a \"plate in place\" (final dish) by correctly interacting with and placing ingredients.\n- The game ends when either:\n  - You successfully create a \"plate in place,\" leading to victory.\n  - You create an incorrect placement, represented by \"wrongplace,\" with a limit of one occurrence, leading to a loss.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully creating a \"plate in place.\"\n- **Loss Condition**: Creating one \"wrongplace\" sprite, which means making a mistake in ingredient combination and placement.\n\n### Proposed Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before making any interactions, identify which ingredients you need and how they need to be combined. The game requires logical thinking about the order of actions.\n  \n2. **Utilize the Boiling Water**: Boiling the raw pasta is a crucial step. Prioritize getting the raw pasta into the boiling water to transform it before adding it to a dish.\n\n3. **Combine Wisely**: Experiment with ingredient combinations incrementally. Start with combinations that you are confident will yield a positive score, such as combining tomato and tuna to create sauce.\n\n4. **Monitor Score Changes**: Always keep an eye on the score changes resulting from your actions. Aim to maximize score while minimizing the risk of reaching the \"wrongplace\" counter limit.\n\n5. **Unlocking the Lock**: Ensure to obtain the key to interact with the lock to avoid any negative consequences of having excess resources or being impeded in progress.\n\n6. **Avoid Wrong Combinations**: Familiarize yourself with the interactions that lead to \"wrongplace\" to minimize errors. For example, avoid placing raw pasta with any of the other ingredients that would cause a penalty.\n\nBy effectively using these strategies, you can navigate the puzzle elements of the game to achieve the goal of creating a \"plate in place\" and winning.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The immediate surroundings include an empty floor tile where several actions can be taken. \n\n### Objective Analysis\nFrom the proposed overall strategy, you want to create a \"plate in place\" which involves manipulating the available ingredients. \n\n### Available Ingredients\n- There is raw pasta ('%') at (7, 3) directly above your avatar.\n- There is also a tuna ('*') at (7, 5) directly above your avatar as well.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation\nLooking at your current strategy and the ingredients nearby, the next logical move would be to collect the raw pasta first to eventually cook it. \n\n### Suggested Action\nTo move closer to the raw pasta at (7, 3), the appropriate action would be to move up. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up to collect the raw pasta is a step towards preparing the final dish, and it aligns with your strategy of gathering essential ingredients without making incorrect combinations that could lead to penalties.",
