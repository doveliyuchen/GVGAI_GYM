Players navigate a grid-like layout while solving puzzles to achieve a specific culinary objective. \n\n**Game Mechanics**: \n- Players control a moving avatar (the chef) who interacts with various objects (sprites) like raw ingredients (pasta, tomato, tuna), boiling water, and locks and keys. \n- The game includes inventory mechanics and transformations where combining ingredients results in either successful or unsuccessful outcomes.\n- Different interactions can lead to various results, including scoring points, creating incorrect components, successfully preparing a dish, or resetting progress.\n\n**Objective**:\n- The primary goal is to create a dish represented by the **plateinplace** sprite. This is achieved by properly preparing the ingredients and sauces according to the game\u2019s rules.\n- Successfully preparing the dish leads to a win, while making too many wrong combinations will result in a loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they create at least one **plateinplace**.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if they create a **wrongplace** object, exceeding the limit of one such object.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Ingredient Management**:\n   - Focus on correctly gathering ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna) and using the boiling water first to transform raw pasta into **pastainplace**.\n\n2. **Correct Combinations**:\n   - Keep the following combinations in mind:\n     - Combine **tomato** with **tuna** for **sauceinplace**.\n     - Combine **pastainplace** with **sauceinplace** to create **plateinplace** (game-winning condition).\n\n3. **Avoid Mistakes**:\n   - Be cautious when combining ingredients to avoid creating **wrongplace** objects, as creating just one leads toward a loss.\n   - Avoid unnecessary interactions, particularly with already placed or transformed objects.\n\n4. **Utilize the Key and Lock Mechanic**:\n   - The key appears to enable accessing new parts of the game or progressing further. Make sure to collect it and use it wisely to keep on track toward reaching your objectives.\n\n5. **Spatial Awareness**:\n   - Pay attention to the layout of the game, avoiding walls and obstacles (depicted as structures in the level) to navigate efficiently between ingredients and preparation stations. \n\n6. **Iterate and Reassess**: \n   - If you accidentally make a wrong combination, use the backtracking mechanic (undoAll) effectively to reset your last decisions and try alternative paths.\n\nBy following this strategy and remaining mindful of the interactions, players can successfully navigate the challenges and achieve the objectives of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> a\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
