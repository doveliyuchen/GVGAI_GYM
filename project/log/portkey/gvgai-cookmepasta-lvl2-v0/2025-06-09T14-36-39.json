Players control a character (the chef) and need to interact with various ingredients and tools to create dishes, solving obstacles related to food preparation.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites & Movement**:\n   - The player controls a moving avatar (the chef) that interacts with different food and cooking-related items.\n   - Key sprites include ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna), cooking resources (boiling water), and passive elements like \"placed ingredients\" that indicate the status of cooking.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect a key and unlock certain areas.\n   - Different combinations of ingredients lead to positive or negative outcomes, significantly influencing the score:\n     - Proper combinations yield high scores (e.g., cooking pasta with the right ingredients).\n     - Improper combinations lead to penalties.\n\n3. **Scoring System**:\n   - Players gain points for correct ingredient combinations and lose points for incorrect ones.\n   - There are clear pathways to create a dish, and players must manage ingredients smartly to maximize their score.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objectives are:\n  - Create the full dish (represented as \"plateinplace\") by correctly combining ingredients.\n  - Avoid mistakes that lead to \"wrongplace\" items, which can limit success and scoring.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Create a \"plateinplace\" sprite (the successfully cooked dish). This allows the player to win.\n- **Loss Condition**: Accumulate a specified number of \"wrongplace\" sprites, resulting in a failure to progress. \n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Understand the Ingredients**: Familiarize yourself with how each ingredient interacts:\n   - Always aim to create combinations that lead to positive results indicated in the interactions list.\n   - Avoid mixing raw pasta with boiling water after the dish is prepared, as it will result in negative scoring.\n\n2. **Plan Your Moves**: \n   - Approach the cooking process systematically\u2014gather ingredients first and then use them in the right sequence to prevent accumulating \"wrongplace\" items.\n   - Keep an eye on the frying process and think ahead to avoid cooking missteps.\n\n3. **Resource Management**:\n   - Use the key wisely. Ensure that you collect it before approaching any locks, as interacting with a lock without the key may lead to penalties.\n   - If you find yourself losing points, backtrack to correct your ingredient placements before reaching the lock.\n\n4. **Navigational Challenges**:\n   - The level layout presents walls and pathways that limit movement. Scan the layout before making moves to find the best routes for ingredient collection.\n   - Keep in mind the relationship between the walls and your key/lock interactions, ensuring you can total your recipes without backtracking unnecessarily.\n\n5. **Iterate and Learn**:\n   - If you fail (accumulate \"wrongplace\" items), analyze the sequences leading to mistakes and adapt strategies for improvement in future attempts.\n\nFollowing these strategies can significantly enhance your gameplay experience, helping you successfully navigate the puzzles and achieve higher scores in this engaging cooking-themed game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> a\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
