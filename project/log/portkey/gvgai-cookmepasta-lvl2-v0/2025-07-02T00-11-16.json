It seems to involve tasks related to preparing food, using ingredients, and managing interactions effectively to achieve a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:  \n1. **Sprites/Objects**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Represent walls and other boundaries (e.g., 'floor', 'lock').\n   - **Moving Avatar**: The main character that the player controls (a chef).\n   - **Resources**: Key that is required to unlock certain elements in the game.\n   - **Ingredients**: Raw materials such as pasta, tuna, and tomatoes that must be combined in specific ways to create edible dishes.\n   - **Food Preparation**: Using boiling water to cook pasta is a central mechanic, with other combinations creating different outcomes.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can move ingredients and transform them based on interactions.\n   - Specific combinations yield results:\n     - Cook raw pasta in boiling water to create cooked pasta.\n     - Combine ingredients (tuna + tomato) to create sauce while avoiding incompatible combinations.\n   - Proper placement of ingredients (creating a \"plate\" of food) scores points, while wrong placements hinder progress.\n\n3. **Scoring System**:\n   - Positive points are awarded for successful interactions (e.g., creating a plate of food).\n   - Negative points are incurred for incorrect combinations, which can result in losing the game if not managed properly.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The primary goal is to create a \"plate of food\" by combining the right ingredients in the correct order.\n- Players must avoid placing ingredients incorrectly since only one 'wrong place' will mean immediate loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- Win: Successfully assemble a 'plateinplace' sprite (complete dish).\n- Loss: Place a combination of ingredients that results in a 'wrongplace' situation.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Ingredient Management**:\n   - Start by collecting the key quickly to avoid getting locked out.\n   - Gather all available ingredients nearby without getting them mixed up.\n\n2. **Identify Successful Combinations**:\n   - Focus on understanding which ingredients can be combined successfully.\n   - Experiment with each ingredient, but keep track to avoid placing any wrong combinations.\n\n3. **Strategic Cooking**:\n   - Always boil the raw pasta as soon as possible since this step is essential for progressing towards the dish.\n   - Decode the reliable combinations and concentrate on learning how to create sauces, as these are essential for completing meals.\n\n4. **Avoid Wrong Moves**:\n   - Since placing one wrong ingredient inappropriately leads to defeat, double-check your combinations before final execution.\n   - Pay attention to the layout and use walls and immovable sprites to your advantage; they can help denote boundaries for valid ingredient placements.\n\n5. **Practice Timing and Positioning**:\n   - Given the movement mechanics, practice moving ingredients without accidentally mixing them up.\n   - Managing the avatar's position strategically will help in quickly accessing necessary ingredients without making a wrong move.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and mastering the interactions between objects, players should be able to successfully navigate the challenges this game presents.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> a\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The raw pasta ('%') is located at (7, 3), directly above the avatar.\n2. The tuna ('*') is located at (9, 10), and is out of immediate reach, requiring down and right movements to access.\n\nBased on the strategy provided earlier, the first step should be to collect the raw pasta since cooking it is essential for making a complete dish. Therefore, the most logical move is to go **up** to pick up the raw pasta.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar to (7, 3), where the raw pasta is located, allowing me to prepare the dish effectively. Following this action aligns with the strategy to gather necessary ingredients while avoiding errors in placement.",
