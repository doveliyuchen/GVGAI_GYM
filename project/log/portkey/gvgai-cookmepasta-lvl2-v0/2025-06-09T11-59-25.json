    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules provided, here is an analysis covering the game genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategic considerations.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game seems to fall into the puzzle genre, with elements of resource management and interaction-based gameplay. It likely features aspects of cooking or food preparation as a thematic element.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various items represent different entities, including:\n   - `floor`, `wall`, and `lock` as immovable items.\n   - `avatar` as the player's character (a chef).\n   - `rawpasta`, `tomato`, `tuna`, and other ingredients as resources that interact with each other.\n   \n2. **Interactions**: The game allows the player to perform specific actions with items:\n   - Interacting raw ingredients (`rawpasta`, `tomato`, `tuna`) with each other and cooking elements (like `boilingwater`) causes transformations that can affect their score.\n   - Players collect a `key`, which can open locks and trigger other interactions.\n   - Some combinations yield a `plateinplace`, which seems to represent completing a dish, while incorrect combinations lead to `wrongplace`.\n\n3. **Score System**: Players score points for successfully placing items correctly (e.g., combining elements to make `sauceinplace` or `plateinplace`) and lose points for incorrect combinations.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to create a final dish (represented as `plateinplace`) using the correct combination of ingredients. The player navigates the environment to collect resources and avoid making incorrect moves that might lead to negative scoring.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having at least one `plateinplace` on the board.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if there\u2019s a `wrongplace` on the board.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Gathering**: Start by collecting all available ingredients, including the `key`, as early as possible.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Correct Combinations**: Focus on making the right combinations that lead to `sauceinplace`. For example, combining `tomato` with `tuna` nets a positive score and is essential for progressing toward creating a dish.\n\n3. **Manage Space**: Pay attention to your spatial movements and how close you are to walls and locks. Avoid interactions that lead to `wrongplace`, as it will lead to a loss condition.\n\n4. **Use Boiling Water Wisely**: Make sure to combine `rawpasta` with `boilingwater` to transform it into `pastainplace` before adding sauces. Failure to do this can impact your score negatively.\n\n5. **Plan Moves**: Since interactions can lead to instant game changes (like scoring changes or moving back), think ahead about your next steps to avoid creating a `wrongplace`.\n\n6. **Avoid Locks and Backtracking**: Efficiently make your way to the lock only when you have the key, and keep an eye on potential backward movements to reduce score loss.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game\u2019s mechanics, avoid pitfalls, and meet the objective in a structured way.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> b\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> b\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> a\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The strategy indicates that I need to prioritize creating combinations to score points without getting a wrong placement.\n\nTo proceed, I should focus on reaching the rawpasta to combine it with boiling water, which is adjacent (at (row 2, col 3)), and potentially combine it with the sauce (which we can make with tomato that I could collect later). The best action to start this process would be to move up towards the rawpasta.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move up:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to help in gathering the necessary resources towards creating the plate in place, adhering to the strategic recommendations.",
