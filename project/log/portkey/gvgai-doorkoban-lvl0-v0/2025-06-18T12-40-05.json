Players must manipulate blocks, avoid obstacles, and navigate through a series of challenges to reach certain goals.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n1. **Sprites**: The game uses various sprites to represent the environment:\n   - **Floor**: Static surfaces that form the ground.\n   - **Avatar**: A movable character controlled by the player.\n   - **Boxes**: Passive objects that players can interact with to solve puzzles.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous areas that can eliminate the avatar or cause game events.\n   - **Doors**: Separate areas; some are closed while others can be opened.\n   - **Walls**: Immoveable objects that provide barriers and structure to the level.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes and interact with them to trigger various responses like being pushed back by a wall or backtracking movement when near a door.\n   - Depending on which box is placed in which hole, players can score points with higher value for specific placements (e.g., box3 in hole3 equals 8 points).\n   - The ultimate goal involves reaching an exit to earn points.\n\n3. **Score System**: \n   - Points increase when certain boxes are placed in designated holes, signifying a scoring mechanism based on player actions.\n\n**Objectives**: \n- The player must navigate the level using their avatar to manipulate boxes and place them in correct holes. By doing this, the player earns points and ultimately unlocks doors or reaches an exit.\n- The player aims to score as highly as possible by strategically interacting with the environment.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- The game ends with a win when the exit sprite's counter reaches zero (the exit is accessed).\n- The game ends with a loss if the player does not achieve this before the timeout limit of 1000 seconds.\n\n**Level Layout**: \n- The layout indicates spatial relationships with walls, paths, and varying obstacles. Points of interest are marked with different letters and symbols indicating the locations of boxes, holes, doors, and the player\u2019s avatar.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Prioritize Box Placement**: \n   - Assess which boxes provide the highest score when placed in their respective holes. Focus on strategically moving boxes into these holes to maximize score before heading to the exit.\n\n2. **Use the Environment Wisely**:\n   - Navigate past walls using bouncing mechanics from boxes rather than colliding with them. Avoid getting stuck or causing unnecessary delays.\n   \n3. **Manage Time**: \n   - Keep track of the timeout limit. Make decisions swiftly, especially in cases where exploring might lead to detours.\n\n4. **Experiment with Interactions**:\n   - Test the interactions with different combinations of boxes and holes to discover potential shortcuts or efficient pathways. Don\u2019t hesitate to restart sections if a strategy does not seem to be working.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path to Exit**:\n   - Once you have scored sufficient points, ensure you have a clear route to the exit. Minimize backtracking or redundant moves that would waste time.\n\n6. **Practice Precision**: \n   - The game may require careful movements to position the avatar just right for optimal box manipulation. Practice will help improve this.\n\nBy following these tips, players can enhance their ability to navigate through the puzzles, score high, and ultimately reach the exit efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> w\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> a\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> h\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> f\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> d\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> .\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> e\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> c\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

    "content": "In the current state, the avatar is located at row 4, column 5, and the possible actions you can take are to either move left, right, up, or down. Since the avatar's movement is crucial for interacting with boxes, holes, and the exit, we need to analyze the immediate surroundings.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- **Left (row 4, col 4)**: There is a hole ('h').\n- **Right (row 4, col 6)**: There is a floor tile ('.').\n- **Up (row 3, col 5)**: There is a hole ('h').\n- **Down (row 5, col 5)**: There is a hole ('h').\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nNone of the immediate positions provides an opportunity to push or place a box since holes are not adjacent to boxes. However, moving towards a hole gives more options for box interactions afterward.\n\n### Next Action:\nGiven the strategic priorities, I will move **down** to the hole at (5,5). This may open up opportunities to access the box at (4,10) in a subsequent move, which might be placed in one of the holes.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down and can open new pathways for box interactions. Expect to align with the strategy of maximizing score from box placements.",
