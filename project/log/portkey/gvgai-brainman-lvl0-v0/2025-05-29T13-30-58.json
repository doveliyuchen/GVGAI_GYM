Players must navigate through a level filled with obstacles, collect items, and solve challenges to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites (Game Elements)**:\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character (represented by 'A') that moves around the level.\n  - **Gems (Green, Red, Blue)**: Collectible items that yield different points when the avatar interacts with them.\n  - **Keys (Key and Keym)**: Passive items that help unlock doors and can potentially kill obstacles or enemies.\n  - **Doors**: Block certain paths and require a key to open.\n  - **Exit**: The final objective to escape the level.\n  - **Walls**: Impassable structures that confine movement.\n  - **Boulders**: They can either block paths or interact with the avatar and other objects.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can interact with walls (which block movement), keys (which can be turned into a missile), doors (which require keys to open), and boulders (which cause movement effects).\n  - Different colors of gems result in various point payouts when collected.\n  - The avatar can be killed by specific interactions with sprites like the green gem and other hazards while interacting with the exit yields significant points.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to **navigate through the level, collect as many gems as possible, and ultimately reach the exit**. Achieving high scores through gem collection is likely important as indicated by the score changes for interactions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player loses if the avatar's count reaches zero (typically when the avatar is killed).\n- The player wins when the exit sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has successfully exited the level.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Familiarize with Controls**: Understand how to navigate the avatar around the walls and boulders without getting trapped.\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection**: Collect keys as soon as possible to unlock doors that may otherwise block progress. Be cautious of the consequences of using the wrong keys.\n3. **Collect Gems for Points**: Focus on collecting the red gems for higher points, while avoiding the green gem that can kill the avatar.\n4. **Plan Your Path**: Before moving into a new section of the level, check the layout visually to avoid walls and positions that can cause backtracking or getting killed.\n5. **Use Boulders Strategically**: Use boulders to navigate or push objects around but be aware of the interactions; they can cause unintended consequences.\n6. **Reach the Exit**: Make your way towards the exit after collecting sufficient points, ensuring there are no barriers (like locked doors) in your path.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, optimize their score through gem collection, and successfully reach the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> &\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> %\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current game state, the avatar (represented by 'a') is located at (2, 5). There are several inaccessible walls (represented by 'b') surrounding the avatar. However, the following important elements are nearby:\n\n- At (1, 1): There is a key ('&')\n- At (2, 11): There is a blue gem ('@')\n- At (3, 11): There is a green gem ('%')\n- At (4, 14): There is an exit ('$')\n\nThe immediate surroundings have walls, limiting my movement options. Given that the objective is to collect keys, gems, and ultimately reach the exit, my first action will be to collect the key at (1, 1), which is accessible.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: Moving down to the key (1, 1) is the most strategic move as it allows me to collect it and unlock potential doors later while maximizing my options for the next turns. I expect this action will lead to better scoring opportunities.",
