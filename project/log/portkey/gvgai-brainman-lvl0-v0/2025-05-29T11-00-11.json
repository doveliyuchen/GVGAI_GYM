Players control an avatar navigating a grid-based environment where various mechanics (like keys, gems, doors, and walls) interact to create challenges.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features different types of sprites, including the player's avatar (which can move), immovable walls/floors (that provide boundaries), keys that transform into different types of objects, gems that can cause damage, and an exit point.\n  \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can push against walls and doors but will bounce back.\n   - Collecting a **key** turns it into a **keym** (a missile-like object).\n   - The avatar can collide with **gems**, which harm it.\n   - When the avatar reaches the **exit** with no avatar sprites left, the game is won.\n\n3. **Score System**: Points are awarded based on interactions: gaining keys or harming by different colored gems adds to the score. Hitting an exit gives the highest score.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to navigate the level, interact with keys and doors, and collect gems while avoiding or overcoming hazards (like harmful gems) to ultimately reach the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: When the exit sprite is no longer present, indicating the player reached the exit successfully.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0), the game is lost.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Take time to understand the layout. Note the positions of obstacles (walls, doors) and the exit.\n   \n2. **Key Management**: Collect the keys first. Change the key to a keym when necessary for more strategic use (e.g., for hitting doors or avoiding pitfalls).\n\n3. **Avoiding Gems**: Green, blue, and red gems deal progressively more damage. Create strategies to avoid these. Be aware of their positions in the map and move cautiously to dodge them.\n\n4. **Clear Pathways**: Use boulders and interactions to clear pathways to the exit. If you get stuck or find yourself with too few options, undoing moves is essential; leverage the interaction rules for that purpose.\n\n5. **Exit Strategy**: Plan a route to the exit while ensuring you've managed your avatar's health (avoiding damage from gems). \n\n6. **Strategic Movement**: When navigating tight spaces or dealing with gems, think two steps ahead. Ensure you have viable escape routes or plans for dealing with obstacles you may encounter. \n\nFollowing this strategic approach will maximize your chances of successfully navigating the level while accumulating points for a higher score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> %\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> a\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar ('a') is positioned at (3, 9) on the map. The goal is to reach the exit ('$'), which is at (4, 14).\n\n1. **Map Layout Understanding**: \n   - Walls ('b') surround the player and the level.\n   - The path consists of empty spaces ('.'), a key ('&') at (2, 9), harmful items (gems: '@' and '*'), and doors ('#') that need keys to open.\n\n2. **Analysis of Actions**:\n   - The next row down (row 4) has the exit, but first, I need to consider the surrounding items and openings. \n   - In row 3, the immediate next space (3, 10) is a wall ('b'), which means I cannot move right.\n   - Moving left (3, 8) or up (to row 2 which has a key) would offer different paths.\n\n3. **Strategic Goals**:\n   - I should first collect the key at (2, 9) which is right above me and then continue towards the exit.\n   - Collecting the key is crucial because the door at (7, 10) blocks my direct access to the exit row from the current position.\n\nGiven all the above considerations, I will choose to move up to collect the key:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action will help me gather a key and prepare to navigate towards the exit strategically.",
