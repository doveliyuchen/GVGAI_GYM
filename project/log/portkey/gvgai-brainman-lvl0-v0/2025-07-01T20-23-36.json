Players navigate a grid-based environment, interact with various elements, and need to solve puzzles to reach the objective.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites such as the player avatar, walls, doors, keys, gems, and boulders. Each has specific characteristics and interacts with others in defined ways.\n   - The player can move the 'avatar' around the grid and interact with other sprites based on the interactions specified.\n   \n2. **Interactions**: \n   - Collecting keys and transforming them into missiles (keym) that can destroy obstacles (walls and doors).\n   - Collecting gems (different colors yield different scores) but also poses a threat as certain ones (e.g., green) can kill the avatar.\n   - The exit sprite must be reached to complete the level.\n\n3. **Movement**: \n   - The avatar can be bounced back by boulders and may step back when encountering walls or doors.\n\n4. **Score System**: Points are awarded for collecting gems and reaching the exit but lost when the avatar gets killed.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to navigate through the level, collect keys (transforming them as needed), avoid hazards (like dangerous gems), and eventually reach the exit to win the game. The game ends if the avatar is killed.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the exit, and the exit sprite count reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before moving, scan the entire level layout to find the best path toward the exit while noting the hazards that exist (like the green gem). Take stock of where keys are needed and their locations.\n\n2. **Collect Keys**: Prioritize obtaining keys as they are crucial for navigating through doors and obstacles. Pay attention to transforming keys into missiles to overcome barriers.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be careful when approaching colored gems, especially the green one, which will kill the avatar. Use knowledge of sprite interactions to bypass or neutralize threats.\n\n4. **Use Boulders Wisely**: Utilize the bouncing mechanics of boulders strategically, as they can help in clearing paths or in repositioning avatars without losing valuable moves.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Collect gems when it's safe to do so, as they contribute to the overall score. Each gem may have different values, with red gems providing the highest points.\n\n6. **Exit Strategy**: After managing barriers and collecting keys, focus on reaching the exit while ensuring that no hazards can instantly lead to the avatar's demise.\n\nFollowing this strategy will help in effectively navigating the game's challenges and increased chances of completing each level successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> %\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> a\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",
