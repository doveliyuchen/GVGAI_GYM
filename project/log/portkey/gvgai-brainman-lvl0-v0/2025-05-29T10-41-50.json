Players must navigate a character through obstacles while solving puzzles that involve interactions with various sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics:\nThe game consists of various sprites (objects) with defined properties and interactions. Key mechanics include:\n\n- **Movement & Interactions:**\n  - The player controls an avatar that can interact with immovable walls, doors, keys, boulders, gems, and exits.\n  - Certain interactions can lead to the transformation of the avatar or other items, like turning keys into missiles (keym).\n  \n- **Item Collection:**\n  - Players collect gems (green, red, blue) to gain points.\n  - Keys must be collected to unlock doors leading to exits.\n\n- **Consequences of Actions:**\n  - The avatar can be \"killed\" or score points based on interactions with the colored gems.\n  - Misguided interactions with certain objects can lead to unfavorable consequences, such as being 'killed' or losing the avatar.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objectives of the game are to:\n1. Collect keys to unlock doors and allow access to the exit.\n2. Accumulate points by collecting different colored gems.\n3. Reach the exit (sprite 'exit') to complete the level, which contributes to a win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning:** The player wins if the exit sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the exit has been accessed.\n- **Losing:** The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, meaning the player has run out of lives (the avatar is dead).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Level:**\n   - Systematically explore the level to find keys and gems. Take note of where doors and exits are located in relation to the gems.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:**\n   - Collect keys first to open doors. Without keys, accessing the exit is impossible. \n\n3. **Manage Interactions Carefully:**\n   - Be aware of the consequences of interacting with different colored gems\u2014the green gem kills the avatar, while the red and blue gems offer higher points.\n   - Use boulders wisely; they bounce back against walls and can obstruct paths or help in item collection.\n\n4. **Plan the Route to Exit:**\n   - Before proceeding through a door, consider the possibility of gaining enough point deductions from interacting with gems. Ensure you have a route planned that leads to the level's exit.\n\n5. **Avoid Paths with High Risk:**\n   - Avoid areas with many green gems, as they are lethal, and strategize when to enter areas where you might encounter them.\n\nBy following this strategy, players should be able to achieve both high scores and successfully complete the level by reaching the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> &\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> a\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",
