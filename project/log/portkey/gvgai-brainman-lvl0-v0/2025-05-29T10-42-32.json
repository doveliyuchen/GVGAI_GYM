The player also aims to maximize their score by collecting gems and efficiently using keys to open doors.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the exit, leading to a score change based on the interaction.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if there are no avatars remaining in play (i.e., the player avatar is \"killed\" by interacting with certain objects like the green gem).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Think ahead to avoid unnecessary interactions that could lead to losing the avatar or getting stuck.\n2. **Focus on Collecting Gems**: Prioritize paths that lead to collectible gems to maximize your score as you progress.\n3. **Manage Keys Wisely**: Use keys strategically to unlock doors, but be aware of their potential transformation into missiles. Ensure you have a plan for when you need to transition them.\n4. **Avoid Danger**: Steer clear of the green gem, as it will cause the avatar to \"die.\" Focus on careful navigation.\n5. **Work Towards the Exit**: As you collect keys and gems, orient your path towards the exit. The exit provides a significant score boost and completes the level.\n\nBy balancing exploration, gem collection, and strategic use of keys, players can effectively navigate the game's challenges to achieve a high score and ultimately win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> %\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> a\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> %\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, my avatar is located at position (5, 7). \nFrom this position, I have some options for movement:\n- To the left (5, 6): This is an empty tile (floor), so movement is possible.\n- To the right (5, 8): This is also an empty tile (floor).\n- Moving down (6, 7): This is an empty tile (floor).\n- Moving up (4, 7): This is also an empty tile (floor).\n\nGiven the strategy to avoid the green gem and maximize scoring through key and gem collection, I can consider my options. \n\nHowever, moving in any direction besides towards the exit might delay progress, unless it leads to gathering more points. The exit is at (4, 14), which is two rows above me, and reaching it directly as my next focus might not be possible if I don't collect necessary items along the way.\n\nI will move to the left (5, 6) as it is a valid empty space that also allows multiple pathways to explore afterwards, keeping the option to collect neighboring gems in my strategy.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will allow me to explore further and plan my next steps toward maximizing score and potentially reaching the exit.
