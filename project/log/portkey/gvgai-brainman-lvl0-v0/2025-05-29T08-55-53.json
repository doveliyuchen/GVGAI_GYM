    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is an analysis including game genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle-adventure** genre. Players navigate through a grid layout with various interactive elements to solve puzzles while managing resources.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game contains various types of sprites, each serving a unique function:\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character that interacts with other elements.\n  - **Gems (green, red, blue)**: Collectibles that can kill the player (green), while others score differently (red gives 5, blue gives 2).\n  - **Keys**: The player can transform to a key and use it to unlock doors.\n  - **Walls and Doors**: Impassable barriers that require specific interactions (like the key) to advance.\n  - **Boulders**: They can bounce the avatar back and can be involved in undoing other interactions.\n  - **Exit**: The point that ends the game and provides a significant score.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate the maze, collect keys, avoid or manage gems, unlock doors, and ultimately reach the exit. The goal is to reach the exit while maximizing your score (indicated by scoring interactions).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the sprite count for the exit reaches zero (meaning the exit is reached).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the player has been killed (either by a gem or potentially another sprite interaction).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Minimize Risks**: Avoid the green gem as it costs a life. Be cautious with other gem types to avoid unintentional deaths.\n   \n2. **Resource Management**: Collect the key as early as possible to open doors and advance through the level. Transforming the avatar into a key allows access to the door.\n\n3. **Utilize Boulders**: Use boulders strategically to bounce back if needed or as a method to interact with walls or gems. The boulders can help reset certain positions if you find yourself stuck.\n\n4. **Plan Your Route**: Look at the layout and plan the optimal path to collect keys and navigate toward the exit while avoiding death from the gems.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: If possible, prioritize collecting red and blue gems for points, but do not chase them at the risk of losing the avatar.\n\n6. **Avoid Conflicting Interactions**: Carefully consider interactions with doors and walls. Use the key wisely to prevent being stuck.\n\nBy carefully navigating the level, managing your interactions with various sprites, and planning your path to collect necessary items, the player can maximize their chance of victory while minimizing loss. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> a\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> %\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

    "content": "To determine the best action to take, let's first analyze the map and the position of the avatar (denoted by 'a'), which is currently located at (1, 3). \n\n### Important Observations:\n1. The immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n   - Up (0, 3): Wall ('b')\n   - Down (2, 3): Empty space ('.')\n   - Left (1, 2): Empty space ('.')\n   - Right (1, 4): Empty space ('.')\n\n2. There are several collectible items in the vicinity:\n   - The red gem ('*') is located at (6, 15).\n   - The blue gem ('@') is located at:\n     - (2, 11)\n     - (6, 1)\n     - (7, 1)\n     - (7, 15)\n\n3. The ultimate goal is to navigate towards the exit located at (4, 14).\n\n### Current Situation:\nSince the previous state indicated that there has been no movement with the avatar (if the action taken led to no shift in position and strictly rotation), we need to decide on a meaningful action that aligns with the strategy, particularly focusing on minimizing risk and maximizing path efficiency toward the exit.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven that the only option that is available for moving is DOWN (as we can unlock more possible paths in future moves if we explore downwards), I will choose the action to move down.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nBy moving down, I expect to encounter more navigable spaces and potentially find additional pathways or collect items that may assist in reaching the exit.",
