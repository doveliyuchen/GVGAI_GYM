    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer genre**. It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a grid-based level, solving puzzles to unlock paths and collect points while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - The game features different sprites: walls, floors, an avatar, gems, keys, doors, and exit points, each with specific interactions.\n   - The avatar can collect items such as keys and gems, which influence gameplay mechanics (e.g., unlocking doors or scoring points).\n   - There are obstacles, including walls and boulders, which the avatar cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can collect keys and transform them into a missile type that can interact with walls and doors.\n   - Certain colored gems impact the avatar adversely (green, blue, red kill the avatar with different score impacts).\n   - The exit point leads to a win condition if the avatar manages to reach it.\n   - Multiple interactions among the different elements can lead to score changes or avatar destruction.\n\n3. **Scoring System:**\n   - The avatar gathers points by avoiding hazards and reaching the exit.\n   - Collecting colored gems can offer points or may lead to losing the game if the wrong ones are touched.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the **exit** while maximizing the score. The player should avoid certain colored gems and enemies that negatively impact the avatar's score and longevity. Successfully using keys to navigate doors is essential for opening paths to the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the exit sprite is reached, with the score reflecting the player's performance.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore and Plan:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout to avoid paths leading directly to harmful sprites. Identify the locations of keys and the exit.\n2. **Strategize Key Use:** Collect keys cautiously and use them strategically to unlock doors while avoiding interactions that might lead to defeat.\n3. **Avoid Red and Green Gems:** Focus on staying away from green and red gems, which are detrimental to the avatar\u2019s survival.\n4. **Score Maximization:** Collect blue gems for points but prioritize reaching the exit to finish the level.\n5. **Utilize Boulders Efficiently:** Use interactions with boulders and the walls to your advantage to create routes or block threats as needed.\n6. **Stay Aware of Avatar Health:** Monitor the avatar\u2019s status and avoid unnecessary conflicts, maintaining a balance between exploration and caution.\n\nBy applying these strategies effectively, players can navigate the game efficiently, maximizing their score while successfully reaching the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> &\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> %\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> %\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

The immediate surroundings include the following:\n\n- To the **left** (5, 4) is a wall ('b').\n- To the **right** (5, 6) is an open space ('.').\n- **Up** (4, 5) is also open ('.').\n- **Down** (6, 5) is open ('.') as well.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the score while making progress towards the exit at (4, 14). The avatar can collect a key at (1, 5), which is advantageous for opening a door later in the game. \n\nSince the avatar has room to move and should prioritize avoiding harmful gems, the next logical step is to first move towards the key. The most effective action is to move **up** to (4, 5).\n\nI'll take this action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis move is expected to lead me closer to the key and away from immediate danger while exploring more of the level for strategic planning.",
