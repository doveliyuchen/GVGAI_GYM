Players must navigate a grid-based map, interacting with various game elements to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game features various sprites: walls, an avatar, keys, gems, exits, doors, and boulders.\n   - Some sprites are immovable (e.g., walls, exit, and floor), while others can interact or be transformed (e.g., boulders, keys).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, doors, keys, and gems in specific ways, either by transforming or causing reactions (like bumping off boulders).\n   - Different colored gems represent different point values, contributing to score accumulation when the avatar encounters them.\n   - Keys can transform the avatar into a key missile (keym) which has different interaction rules, particularly with doors.\n\n3. **Movement and Actions:**\n   - The avatar can only move forward in certain situations, and interaction rules dictate how it reacts to encountering other sprites.\n   - The game includes strategic elements where transforming keys and finding the right paths are crucial.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to collect items (gems and keys) while avoiding enemies (represented by colored gems) and to reach the exit. Points are accumulated through scoring based on gem collection and reaching the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the exit sprite is cleared, marking the end of the game.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is no longer present on the screen (SpriteCounter limit for avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Navigation Awareness:** Be mindful of your path; aim to avoid areas where enemies (colored gems) can deal damage. Prioritize safe movement between walls and boulders.\n\n2. **Key Management:** Collect keys early when possible, as they transform the avatar into a key missile that can interact more effectively with locked doors. Use the keym to navigate through doors strategically.\n\n3. **Gem Exploitation:** Although collecting gems increases your score, prioritize avoiding gems that result in losing health or life. Consider the value of each gem and whether it is worth the risk.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:** Since movement interacts with other elements (like walls and boulders), think a few steps ahead before moving. This helps in optimizing positioning for future turns and avoiding traps.\n\n5. **Use Boulders Wisely:** Boulders can bounce off the avatar, potentially clearing paths or incidents with enemies. Use them strategically to create advantages.\n\n6. **Take Care at the Exit:** Make sure that all conditions are met and that there are no remaining hazards before heading towards the exit.\n\nBy following these strategies while keeping an eye on your health and your score, you can effectively navigate through the puzzle challenges and succeed in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> &\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> %\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

Interestingly, moving to (7, 8) will give me clear movement options but offers no immediate gains.\n\nThe exit (4, 14) is directly up the grid from my position, and while I currently cannot directly reach it without navigating around some obstacles, the key just above at (1, 5) is enticing.\n\nGiven all this information, my best strategic move now would be to go left to explore any potential opportunities or path openings without engaging hazards, planning to evaluate further moves afterward.\n\nI'll execute the action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this action will allow me to examine the surrounding space further and create better opportunities for upcoming moves while avoiding immediate threats.",
