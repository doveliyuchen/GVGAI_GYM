The keys are essential for interacting with doors and achieving game objectives.\n- **Score System:** Collecting gems score different points (green = 1, blue = 2, red = 5). Reaching the exit awards 10 points, and killing enemies (such as the green gem) has a scoring impact.\n- **Undo Mechanisms:** Certain interactions can revert previous actions, indicating a strategic thought process is involved in solving puzzles.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary goal is to reach the exit while maximizing the score by collecting gems and avoiding detrimental interactions (like with the green gem).\n- The player must effectively manage keys and use them to open doors while navigating the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player loses if their avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' = 0).\n- The player wins by successfully reaching the exit (SpriteCounter for 'exit' = 0).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Prioritize Gem Collection:** Focus on collecting high-value gems (particularly red for 5 points). Balance gem collection with avoiding harm from interactions with specific colored gems.\n  \n2. **Key Management:** Collect keys as soon as possible. Transform them into keyms for interaction with doors, but be mindful of how many keys are available since they are limited.\n\n3. **Utilize Undos Wisely:** Keep an eye on situations where you can undo actions. If you mistakenly drop or misplace gems or keys, look for ways to revert your moves and restore advantageous positioning.\n\n4. **Plan Your Movements:** Analyze the level layout carefully. Move in a way that considers the possible consequences of each action, especially regarding interactions with walls, boulders, and doors.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards:** Avoid interactions that can kill your avatar, particularly with the wrong colored gems or through unnecessary clashes with walls or doors while carrying keys.\n\n6. **Calculation of Score Potential:** As you navigate, consider which paths maximize your potential score based on the number and type of gems collected, and paths around doors.\n\n### Conclusion\nEngaging with a structured approach to collecting resources, managing interactions, and using strategic moves will enhance your gameplay experience. Mastering key mechanics, taking advantage of scoring opportunities, and avoiding pitfalls is essential for success in this puzzle-platformer environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=0, col=16 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> %\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=16 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=16 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> %\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=16 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> *\nrow=6, col=16 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> a\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=16 -> b",

    "content": "To determine the best action for the avatar (currently at row 7, column 9) based on the state and the game mechanics, we need to consider the immediate surroundings:\n\n- The avatar is located at (7, 9), which has a door ('#') immediately to the right (at (7, 10)). \n- The tiles immediately around the avatar are as follows:\n  - Left (7, 8) - contains '%', a green gem.\n  - Right (7, 10) - contains '#', a door.\n  - Up (6, 9) - contains '@', a blue gem.\n  - Down (8, 9) - contains 'b', a wall.\n\nGiven these interactions, the door at (7, 10) is a significant point to interact with because it potentially allows for further progression through the level if we have keys available. Currently, the avatar is positioned one tile away from that door.\n\nPer the strategy, we should aim to use our keys effectively to open doors and minimize interactions that could cause harm. However, there are no keys visible at the avatar's current position\u2014which makes it crucial to prioritize reaching toward more interactive elements while avoiding detrimental interactions with the green gem.\n\nThe following move can be made:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar right towards the door, facilitating interaction with it in the next turn (assuming we can interact if we have keys). This aligns with the strategy of managing keys and using interactions effectively to progress through the level.",
