    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle game. The limited movement, object manipulation, and specific win condition strongly suggest a puzzle-solving focus. It looks like a variant of sokoban\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The core mechanic revolves around pushing boxes.\n*   **Immovable Objects:** Walls and Holes cannot be moved.\n*   **Collision:** Collisions with walls cause the avatar to step back.\n*   **Box Behavior:** Pushing a box into a hole eliminates the box and increases the score. Pushing a box against a wall and another box undoes all actions.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Eliminate all boxes on the playfield.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All boxes are eliminated.\n*   **Loss:** Implied - Getting stuck or making a mistake in such a way that boxes cannot be pushed into the holes to trigger the win condition.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Before making any moves, visualize the entire sequence needed to get the boxes into the holes.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Be extremely careful not to push boxes into corners or against walls in a way that blocks them permanently.\n3.  **Utilize Space:** Maneuver the avatar to position boxes optimally for pushing into holes.\n4.  **Hole Prioritization:** If there are multiple boxes and holes, consider which box to eliminate first based on the available space and potential for blocking other boxes.\n5.  **Avoid wall + box + box configurations**: undoAll is an important piece of information to avoid accidentally triggering it.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",
