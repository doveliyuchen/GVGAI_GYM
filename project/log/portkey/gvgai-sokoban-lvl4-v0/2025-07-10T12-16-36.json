Each time a box touches a hole, it\u2019s removed (and you score a point). When all boxes are gone, you win.\n\n\u2022 Key Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 You control an avatar (a knight) that moves around a grid-like level.\n\u2003\u2013 Walls and floors set the boundaries. Walls are immovable obstacles, and if the avatar bumps into one, they simply step back.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes are passive objects that you need to move and position. When a box collides with a hole, it \u201cdies\u201d (is removed) and you gain a score.\n\u2003\u2013 If boxes interact in certain ways (specifically, if a box collides with a wall and then another box, as indicated by the \u201cbox wall box\u201d rule), all recent moves might be undone. This means that careless moves or misalignments can force you to reset your progress.\n\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Win: You clear the level by getting the count of boxes to zero.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s no explicit \u201closs\u201d state described, but triggering undo actions might make the puzzle more challenging or force you to reconsider your moves.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy Tips:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan your moves carefully. Think ahead about how pushing a box might position it relative to walls and holes.\n\u2003\u2013 Aim to guide each box to a hole with minimal moves. Every box should be pushed in the correct direction without accidentally setting up a situation that triggers the undo action.\n\u2003\u2013 Keep an eye on your surroundings. Since colliding with walls just moves your avatar back, use this to your advantage to reposition without overshooting.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid making moves that result in boxes accumulating in problematic spots (especially where \u201cbox wall box\u201d might occur) because reversing progress can set you back.\n\nIn summary, by methodically guiding each box into a hole while avoiding movement patterns that trigger undo actions, you can successfully solve the puzzle levels and win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",
