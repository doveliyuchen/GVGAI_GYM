    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s a breakdown of the game genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a possible overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fit within the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players need to navigate a space while using strategic thinking to solve puzzles involving moving objects (in this case, boxes) and avoiding hazards (like the holes).\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** A basic part of the terrain where the avatar can stand or move.\n   - **Hole:** Acts as a trap or hazard, causing the avatar to lose if interacted with.\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can move around the level.\n   - **Box:** An object that can be pushed or interacted with but can't be moved through.\n   - **Wall:** Acts as a barrier that the avatar cannot pass.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - When the avatar hits a wall, it will step back (collision response).\n   - If the avatar moves into a box, it will bounce back, indicating that the box cannot be moved in that way.\n   - If a box hits a wall, it undoes all movements, implying boxes are somewhat fixed.\n   - If a box falls into a hole, the player scores points and loses that box.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes from the level (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`). This will require strategic movement and placement of boxes, possibly utilizing the bottomless holes as a means to achieve this.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully eliminating all boxes within the level.\n- **Loss Condition:** Though not explicitly mentioned, interacting with a hole without appropriate planning would result in losing a box and potentially hindering progress toward the win condition.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout; note where boxes are positioned and where holes are located.\n2. **Plan Moves:** Carefully consider how moving boxes around can lead them to the holes while ensuring you do not get stuck or eliminate essential boxes prematurely.\n3. **Utilize Walls:** Use walls to bounce the avatar away from walls and avoid getting trapped. Avoid unnecessary movements that could lead to loss of boxes.\n4. **Sequential Removal:** Identify a sequence in which you can eliminate boxes efficiently by ensuring you do not block yourself or create a situation where a box cannot be pushed into a hole.\n5. **Avoid Traps:** Always be cautious around holes, ensuring that you have an escape plan or can safely move boxes without inadvertently losing them.\n\nIn summary, this game requires spatial reasoning, planning, and careful interactions. The objective is to remove all boxes by navigating the avatar strategically through the level while leveraging the environment to achieve the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> a\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",

Currently, there is one box located directly to the right of the avatar.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the avatar's position, it can move right to (row=1, col=6) where it can then push the box into (row=1, col=7). This would be the first action to eliminate a box.\n\n### Action Decision\n- **Action Right (2):** The best action here is to push the box by moving the avatar to the right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to lead to a successful move, where the avatar will push the box down towards the hole in the next move.",
