Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a spatial puzzle game where you control an avatar (a knight) who can push boxes around a level filled with walls and special tiles.\n\u2003\u2013 The level is set out on a grid. Walls (depicted as \u201cw\u201d) block movement, so the avatar can\u2019t simply walk through them.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes (\u201c1\u201d in the level) are movable objects: when the avatar bumps into a box, the box \u201cbounces forward\u201d (it gets pushed in that direction).\n\u2003\u2013 There are holes (\u201c0\u201d in the level) that serve as targets. When a box is pushed into a hole, that box gets removed (it \u201cdies\u201d) and you score a point.\n\u2003\u2013 An interesting twist: there\u2019s an interaction rule where if a box is pushed into a configuration involving a wall and another box (the rule \u201cbox wall box\u201d), then all moves are undone. This adds an extra layer of challenge, so you must be careful about how boxes interact when near walls or each other.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your primary goal is to eliminate all of the boxes from the level\u2014once no boxes remain, you win.\n\u2003\u2013 Clearing a box is done by maneuvering it so that it falls into a hole.\n\u2003\u2013 While scoring is mentioned (each box\u2013hole interaction gives you a point), the win is achieved by simply removing every box.\n\n\u2022 Strategy Suggestions:\n\u20031. Plan Ahead: Since every move matters, try to visualize the path a box will take when pushed. Think about not just where the box will go, but how it might interact with walls or other boxes that could force an unwanted \u201cundoAll\u201d reset.\n\u20032. Use the Bounce: Leverage the \u201cbounceForward\u201d mechanic when interacting with boxes. This gives you some control over their movement, so use it to aim boxes directly toward holes.\n\u20033. Avoid Traps: Be cautious about lining boxes up next to walls in the wrong way. The \u201cbox wall box\u201d rule will undo your progress if boxes get arranged in a problematic configuration, so avoid pushing boxes into corners or tight clusters where they might block each other.\n\u20034. Step Back When Needed: Remember that if your avatar tries to move into a wall, it automatically steps back. This means you have a bit of a safety net so that accidental moves into walls aren\u2019t harmful\u2014but don\u2019t rely on it to fix mis-pushed boxes.\n\u20035. Incremental Progress: Tackle one or two box maneuvers at a time. Once you successfully direct a box into a hole and eliminate it, the puzzle simplifies. Take stock after each move before committing to the next.\n\nIn summary, think of the game as a test of foresight and precise pushes where every decision counts. Mastering the movement of your avatar and the careful control of boxes will help you clear the board and win the level. Enjoy solving the puzzle!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> a\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",
