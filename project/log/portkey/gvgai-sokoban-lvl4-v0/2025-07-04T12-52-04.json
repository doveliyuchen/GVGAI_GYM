Visualize how boxes might interact with holes and walls.\n\n2. **Plan Movements:** Before moving, plan your moves to ensure that boxes can be pushed towards the holes without obstruction. \n\n3. **Box Management:** Make sure to move boxes strategically. Try to avoid creating situations where boxes are stuck by walls since this can lead to deadlocks.\n\n4. **Utilize Bouncing Effectively:** Use the bounce mechanism to push boxes into areas where they can fall into holes. This may require some trial and error to get the timing and positioning right.\n\n5. **Score Awareness:** Keep track of how many boxes you\u2019ve destroyed, as this is crucial for reaching the winning condition. Aim to minimize the number of boxes left on the board.\n\n6. **Explore Each Level:** If available, take time to explore various approaches in terms of box movement, as some configurations might yield unexpected pathways to eliminate boxes efficiently.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics, players can effectively tackle the puzzles presented in this game and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",

    "content": "To determine the next move for the avatar in the given state, let's analyze the current situation:\n\n- The avatar (`a`) is positioned at (row=6, col=5).\n- There is a box (`@`) located at (row=3, col=1).\n- There are holes (`0`) positioned at (row=1, col=3) and (row=6, col=3).\n- The rest of the surroundings contain walls (`w`) which restrict movement.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. The objective is to eliminate boxes by pushing them into the holes.\n2. The box is too far to directly move into the hole in row 1 (col 3) since it requires too many moves to the right.\n3. The box in row 3 cannot immediately be moved since it is three rows above the avatar, and any direct movement towards the box will not allow it to reach a hole soon.\n\n### Available Actions:\nIn this context, since the avatar is at (6, 5) and the nearest hole is at (6, 3), the best course of action is to move left towards the hole:\n- If I move **LEFT (ACTION_LEFT)**: The avatar moves to (6, 4), then a subsequent left will position the avatar adjacent to the hole at (6, 3), allowing for the manipulation of the nearby boxes if needed.\n\n### Next Move\nSince I want to get closer to the hole to potentially get rid of the box, I will attempt to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis should position the avatar closer to the hole and enable future moves to interact with the box. I expect to be able to proceed further towards the hole on the next turn.",
