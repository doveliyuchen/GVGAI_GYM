You control an avatar (a knight) that moves around a level filled with immovable walls and floors, along with movable boxes and stationary holes.\n\nGame Mechanics:\n\u2022 Movement & Interaction: You guide the avatar, and when it bumps into walls it simply steps back\u2014that is, walls block your progress. Boxes are passive objects that you can push around. If the avatar collides with a box, the box will \u201cbounce\u201d forward.\n\u2022 Special Interactions: When a box runs into a wall and then bumps into another box (as described by \u201cbox wall box\u201d), it triggers an \u201cundo\u201d of all recent moves. This likely prevents unwanted chain reactions or incorrect pushes.\n\u2022 Scoring & Removal: The key interaction is with holes. When a box touches a hole, it is \u201ckilled\u201d (removed from the level) and you gain a point. The game ends in a win when all boxes have been removed from the board.\n\nObjective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2022 The objective is to remove all the boxes by pushing them into holes. The level is won when the count of boxes reaches zero.\n\u2022 Losing might occur if you end up in a situation where you can no longer maneuver the boxes into the holes\u2014although specific loss conditions aren\u2019t laid out, poor moves (especially ones that trigger the undo action) might force you to restart.\n\nOverall Strategy:\n1. Plan Your Moves: Since your goal is to strategically push boxes into holes, take time to observe the starting layout\u2014including the positions of the boxes, holes, and walls. Identify which boxes can be pushed straight into holes with minimal maneuvers.\n2. Use Walls to Your Advantage: Walls restrict both your movements and those of boxes. They can help guide the box\u2019s trajectory when bounced forward. However, be cautious\u2014a misdirected push might cause a box to hit a wall and another box, triggering an undo of all moves.\n3. Think Ahead: Avoid accidental collisions that force you to reverse your progress. Use careful, incremental moves, and always consider where the box will go when you push it.\n4. Manage Risks: The \u201cundoAll\u201d trigger means that if a box collides with a wall and another box in the wrong way, you\u2019ll lose your progress, so work to prevent situations where boxes become entangled. Try to clear one box at a time if possible.\n5. Practice Precision: The \u201cbounceForward\u201d mechanism helps move boxes, but it requires precise alignment. Work on pushing boxes in ways that have them naturally fall into holes without causing chain reactions that force a reset.\n\nIn short, this game challenges you with spatial puzzles where each move can have a big impact on the board layout. By planning your moves carefully and using the environment to your advantage, you\u2019ll gradually push all the boxes into the holes and win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",
