    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The core gameplay seems to revolve around pushing boxes (`box`) around the level using the avatar (`avatar`).\n*   **Movement Restrictions:** Walls (`wall`) block both the avatar and boxes. The `stepBack` interaction indicates the avatar can't simply walk through walls.\n*   **Object Placement:** Boxes can be pushed into holes (`hole`).\n*   **Undo:** Pushing two boxes onto a wall simultaneously causes an undo.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The goal is to eliminate all boxes from the level.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The player wins when the number of boxes remaining (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0`) reaches zero.\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   The provided rules don't explicitly define a loss condition. It's possible the game assumes a level is unsolvable if boxes become stuck in a way that prevents them from being pushed into holes.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Represents walls.\n*   `.`: Represents the floor.\n*   `0` and `1`: Likely represent the initial positions of boxes. The numbers probably differentiate boxes for puzzle-solving purposes (order matters).\n*   `A`: Represents the initial position of the avatar.\n\n**General Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Your Moves:** Because of the limited pushing mechanic, think several steps ahead. Avoid trapping boxes against walls or in corners where you can't maneuver them.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Box Order:** Given the numbers `0` and `1` on the boxes in the level layout, the order in which you push the boxes into holes will be crucial. Identify which box needs to go first to avoid blocking the path of other boxes.\n\n3.  **Avoid Unnecessary Pushes:** Since pushing a box into two walls simultaneously undoes the entire action, be careful to not accidentally trigger the undo.\n\n4.  **Utilize the Hole Placement:** The level layout seems to have holes strategically placed. Analyze the hole placements to identify the right spots to push the boxes and solve the puzzle.\n\n5.  **Explore the Level:** Understand the layout of the level before making any pushes. Find the path that allows you to move each box one by one into the holes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> 0\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",
