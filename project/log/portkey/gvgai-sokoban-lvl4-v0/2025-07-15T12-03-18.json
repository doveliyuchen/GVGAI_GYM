Players navigate through the environment and interact with various elements to achieve specific objectives, likely involving strategy and spatial reasoning.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites & Movement**:\n  - The game features different types of sprites: immovable (like walls and holes) and movable (the avatar).\n  - The avatar can move around the environment, while boxes can be pushed or interacted with.\n  \n- **Interactions**:\n  - There are specific interactions defined between the avatar, boxes, walls, and holes.\n  - The avatar cannot pass through walls (they step back upon collision).\n  - If the avatar interacts with a box, it bounces forward, suggesting momentum is essential for gameplay.\n  - Boxes can be moved into holes, leading to a sprite being removed from the game and changing the score positively.\n  - Boxes colliding with walls undo their progress, leading to no helpful outcome.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all the boxes from the level by pushing them into the holes. The game ends successfully when there are no boxes left (SpriteCounter for boxes reaching 0 results in a win).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes must be eliminated from the level by getting them into the holes.\n- **Loss Condition**: Presumably, if the player gets stuck (unable to push boxes or move), they may not be able to continue, although specific loss conditions aren\u2019t detailed.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements**:\n   - Carefully assess the positioning of boxes and their proximity to holes. Before making a move, plan out your actions to avoid getting stuck or misdirecting boxes.\n\n2. **Use Momentum Advantageously**:\n   - When pushing boxes, position the avatar to maximize distance for a better bounce effect, allowing for easier maneuvering to direct him towards the holes.\n\n3. **Avoid Deadlocks**:\n   - Be cautious with box placement near walls. Since boxes hitting walls undo movements, ensure that you predict their movements to avoid blocking holes with walls inadvertently.\n\n4. **Work Towards Central Boxes**:\n   - Since there are multiple boxes (labelled as 0, 1, etc.), focus on getting boxes closest to holes first and then work outward, which makes managing your moves more efficient.\n\n5. **Take Advantage of the Level Layout**:\n   - Recognize the layout; since there are walls (boundaries), use them to funnel boxes in desired directions while preventing unintentional collisions that hinder progression.\n\nBy applying these strategies while keeping an eye on the box elimination goal, players can successfully navigate through the levels and achieve a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> a\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w",
