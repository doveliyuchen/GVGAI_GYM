Collect sand (a vital resource) to navigate obstacles.\n2. Avoid dangers (fire and whirlpool) that can eliminate the avatar.\n3. Reach the goal sprite to finish the game successfully and potentially collect treasure.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Conditions: \n  - The game is won if the avatar reaches the goal sprite with no remaining goal sprites in play.\n- Loss Conditions:\n  - The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (losing all lives) or if the time limit is reached without reaching the goal.\n\n**Level Layout:** \nFrom the level layout, it seems to involve navigating through an area with various obstacles (indicated by \u2018x\u2019 for walls) and resources to collect (like \u2018b\u2019 for bombs, \u2018t\u2019 for treasure, and \u2018p\u2019 for possibly a portal or additional features). The placement of obstacles suggests strategic planning is essential for navigating towards the goal.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Make collecting sand a priority since it allows you to interact with water and other elements crucial for progressing.\n   - Constantly assess and maintain sand levels, ensuring that you have enough to manipulate your environment.\n\n2. **Navigating Obstacles:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the positions of hazards (like fire and whirlpool) and find paths that allow you to avoid them or have the necessary resources to counteract their effects.\n\n3. **Utilizing the Shovel:**\n   - Use the shovel wisely to convert land types and spawn sand, ensuring you have a steady supply.\n   - Dig in areas with landSand for additional sand, especially before moving towards water or hazardous zones.\n\n4. **Timing and Exploration:**\n   - Manage your time effectively while exploring the level. Ensure that you are making progress toward the goal before time runs out.\n   - Use quick and smart navigation techniques to reduce the risk of encountering dangers.\n\n5. **Treasure Collection:**\n   - Collect treasure items along the way for bonus points, as they can provide significant score increases and potentially help in achieving the overall objectives.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, the player can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the environment, managing resources efficiently, and reaching the goal within the time limit while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater -> '.'\nlandSand -> 'x'\nwater bomb -> 'b'\nwater whirlpool -> 'p'\nlandSand treasure -> 't'\nlandSand goal -> 'g'\nbomb water -> '@'\ngoal landSand -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> x\nrow=1, col=4 -> x\nrow=1, col=5 -> x\nrow=1, col=6 -> x\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> x\nrow=2, col=3 -> x\nrow=2, col=4 -> x\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=0 -> .\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> x\nrow=3, col=4 -> x\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> t\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> x\nrow=4, col=13 -> x\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=0 -> .\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> x\nrow=5, col=12 -> x\nrow=5, col=13 -> x\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> p\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=0 -> .\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> p\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> x\nrow=8, col=12 -> x\nrow=8, col=13 -> x\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=0 -> .\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> x\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> x\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .",

    "content": "To determine the next action, we need to evaluate the current state and strategy to maximize our chances of winning the game. The avatar's current position is at (2, 5), surrounded by various elements of landSand, water, and some hazards.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n1. The avatar is on landSand (indicated by 'a' at (2, 5)).\n2. To the left (2, 4) and right (2, 6) are free cells (water), which means moving there won't immediately pose a danger.\n3. There are multiple treasures (t) below (3, 13) and a goal (g) at (9, 12).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- The objective is to collect sand for navigation and avoid hazards.\n- The goal (g) is quite far down, so we will need to navigate through various paths and potentially collect treasures.\n\n### Required Action:\nSince I am currently considering moving down, as moving down (3, 5) should keep me near land while also exploring treasures and ultimately be on the path toward the goal at the last row.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nFeedback: I expect that moving down will provide further exploration opportunities while keeping me safe since it would still be a landSand area.",
