    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s a comprehensive analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **2D Space Adventure** or **Arcade Shooter** with strategic elements. Players seem to navigate a space environment while controlling an avatar (spaceship) and interacting with various sprites, including threats and resources.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - The game contains multiple types of sprites including the avatar (player-controlled spaceship), turrets (random bombers), nebulae (hazards), planets (resources), bombs (projectiles), and a black hole (danger).\n   - Passive and immovable sprites (like planets and background) provide environmental interactions.\n\n2. **Health and Scoring**: \n   - The avatar has health points; interactions with certain sprites can either decrease health (like the nebula and bombs) or increase it (like busy planets).\n   - Using the black hole results in a score increase, suggesting it may be a collectible or goal cumulating elements.\n\n3. **Transformations**: \n   - The avatar can transform empty planets into busy planets when interacting with them, possibly representing resource collection or base-building mechanics.\n\n4. **Cool Down System**: \n   - The turrets fire bombs with a cooldown period, adding a timing element to the threats faced by the player.\n\n### Objective\n- The primary objective of the game seems to be to **survive** while manipulating the environment (transforming empty planets) and avoiding damage from hazards like nebulae, bombs, and the black hole.\n- Players must also manage their avatar's health effectively to prolong gameplay.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The game ends in a win if the count of black holes reaches zero, indicating that they may need to be avoided or inactivated.\n- The game ends in a loss if the avatar is destroyed (health reaches zero) or if the game times out after 1000 units of time.\n\n### Strategies\n1. **Health Management**:\n   - Players should focus on maintaining their avatar's health by frequently interacting with busy planets to replenish health points.\n   - Avoid areas with nebulae and ensure to dodge bombs, as their interactions can rapidly deplete health.\n\n2. **Map Awareness**:\n   - Navigating the level layout is crucial; players should learn the locations of hazards (together with the safe spots like planets) to efficiently maneuver and search for resources.\n   - Pay attention to where turrets are placed; they can pose a significant threat if approached carelessly.\n\n3. **Resource Control**:\n   - Prioritize transforming empty planets into busy planets. This can boost health recovery, giving players a sustainable resource management strategy.\n   - Monitor the sprite counter for black holes and prioritize objectives that contribute to their removal.\n\n4. **Timing and Patience**:\n   - Since turrets have a cooldown state, observe their firing patterns. Engaging carefully during downtime could be the key to avoiding damage.\n   - Use the timer effectively; interacting with atmosphere sprites could provide strategic benefits by creating opportunities to manage the board.\n\n5. **Avoiding the Black Hole**:\n   - Since interacting with the black hole results in a loss, players should formulate routes that keep a safe distance from it while still allowing the collection of necessary sprites.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, success in this game rests on a blend of health management, strategic navigation, timely interactions with sprites, and a strong understanding of the level layout. Players need to balance avoidance of threats while maximizing the advantages from resource-giving sprites to achieve a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To create an optimal strategy, I need to analyze the current state of the game, particularly my avatar's position, health status, and locations of hazards and resources.\n\nBased on the rules and strategies provided, my core focus should be on avoiding hazards (like nebulae and bombs) while transforming empty planets for health recovery and managing black holes.\n\nSince you have advised me to ensure my avatar\u2019s position changes, I will need to check my current location. If I find myself stagnant, I should attempt to reposition by moving in a direction that also aims to collect resources or avoid threats based on the layout of the game.\n\nWithout specific information about the current game state (like avatar position, health points, and the locations of various sprites), I cannot determine the best action to take. However, I will assume a safe, generic movement to either the left or right:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move will help check for potential resources or safe paths and should align with my strategy of navigating without engaging hazards.",
