    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a **top-down arcade shooter** with elements of strategy and resource management. Players navigate a space environment, managing health points and utilizing various sprites while avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The player controls an **avatar** (spaceship) with health points, represented by a sprite that can interact with other objects like planets, bombs, turrets, and a black hole.\n   - The **nebula** and **bombs** are significant hazards; they can hurt the avatar.\n   - The **black hole** is a passive threat that can eliminate the avatar.\n   - **Planets** can either be \"empty\" or \"busy,\" with activities that can enhance or detract from player health.\n   - **Turrets** act as obstacles that randomly shoot bombs at the avatar.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar's health decreases upon colliding with hazardous sprites (nebula, bomb).\n   - The avatar can transform empty planets into busy planets, likely gaining benefits from them.\n   - The avatar restores health by interacting with empty planets.\n   - A timer mechanic exists for transforming multiple planets simultaneously, which introduces a strategic element to managing resources.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends when the player's avatar is destroyed (health reaches zero) or the black hole consumes it.\n   - Winning conditions depend on the absence of the avatar and during a timeout period.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to keep the **avatar** alive for as long as possible, strategically interacting with planets to manage health and survive against hazards while eventually eliminating the black holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win:** Successfully destroy all black holes before the avatar's health is depleted or during the game.\n- **Loss:** The avatar's health reaches zero from colliding with nebulae, bombs, or being consumed by the black hole.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Awareness of Hazards:**\n   - Constantly monitor the environment for turrets and bombs. Move carefully to avoid incoming projectiles.\n   - Utilize the open space effectively, avoiding tight corners where turrets can flank the avatar.\n\n2. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize healing by finding and interacting with empty planets to transform them into busy planets.\n   - Keep an eye on the health points. If they drop too low, seek out planets to restore health immediately.\n\n3. **Planets and Atmosphere Interaction:**\n   - Use the atmosphere strategically to convert multiple planets quickly when the timer is engaged. This makes it easier to manage resources and health from a distance.\n   - Balancing attacks on planets and evasion from hazards is critical to maintaining a healthy avatar.\n\n4. **Black Hole Engagement:**\n   - Focus on eliminating black holes efficiently, as they pose a long-term threat.\n   - When attacking the black holes, ensure enough health buffer is maintained from interactions with planets.\n\n5. **Tactical Movement:**\n   - Employ a hit-and-run strategy against turrets (shoot, then evade) to avoid unnecessary damage.\n   - Use the map layout to your advantage; navigate around walls and other sprites to keep moving and be less predictable.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding game mechanics, players can enhance their chances of surviving longer and defeating the black holes, ultimately winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

I expect this movement to help me maintain a safe distance and strategize further.",
