    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to fit within the **action-adventure or survival** genre, focusing on player exploration and interaction with various elements within the environment. Given the use of avatars, enemies (bombs, turrets), and health points, it may also incorporate elements typical of **arcade-style shooter games**.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Avatars and Interaction**: The player controls an avatar (spaceship) that can interact with various sprites:\n   - The avatar has health points (HP), which can be affected by interactions with enemies (bombs, turrets) or environmental hazards (nebula, blackhole).\n2. **Health Management**: The avatar can gain health from specific sprites (planets) and may lose health from others (nebula, bombs).\n3. **Transformation Mechanics**: The avatar can transform empty planets into busy ones by landing on them.\n4. **Timer and State Changes**: There is a mechanism involving the atmosphere that changes states of planets using timers.\n5. **Obstacles**: Bombs and turrets act as enemies, and their interactions can be lethal to the avatar.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to keep the avatar alive while navigating the game world and converting empty planets into busy ones. The secondary objective is to prevent the occurrence of blackholes by ensuring the lifespan of the avatar does not exhaust (maintaining health and avoiding lethal interactions).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the sprite counter for blackholes reaches zero, indicating that no blackholes threaten the avatar anymore.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - If the avatar's sprite counter reaches zero.\n  - If the objective is left unachieved within a time limit of 1000 units, resulting in a timeout.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Health Preservation**:\n   - Prioritize gaining health from planets before engaging with enemy sprites.\n   - Avoid bombs and turrets until you have enough health to withstand their attacks.\n\n2. **Efficient Planet Conversion**:\n   - Focus on landing on empty planets to transform them before the risks become overwhelming.\n   - Use the areas with fewer enemies (preferably away from turrets and bombs) to convert planets safely.\n\n3. **Managing Environmental Hazards**:\n   - Keep aware of the nebula and blackhole locations to strategize movement and avoid areas that can cause immediate health loss.\n\n4. **Timing the Interaction**:\n   - Make use of the atmosphere sprite's timer ability wisely; turning busy planets back to empty ones may generate tactical advantages by confusing the enemies or leading them away from the avatar.\n\n5. **Combat Strategy**:\n   - Generally avoid unnecessary confrontations with turrets and bombs.\n   - Use speed and maneuverability to evade dangerous areas while looking for safe zones to recuperate.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can optimize their chances of success in navigating the challenges of the game and transforming the world while managing their avatar's viability against enemies and hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

Understanding the environmental hazards and available health resources is crucial. \n\nSince I don't have specific details about the current state, I'll take the following action:\n\n``` Action: ACTION_UP ```\nThis action aims to explore new territory above my current position, potentially moving towards health-gaining planets or away from dangerous enemies. I expect to gather more information about my surroundings, which aligns with the strategy of preserving health and converting planets.",
