    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **action-adventure** genre with **strategy elements**. Players control an \"avatar\" in a strategic space environment where they must navigate obstacles, collect resources, manage health, and avoid hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various types of objects exist:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can move around and interact with other objects.\n   - **Nebula**: A harmful element that decreases the avatar's health.\n   - **Turrets**: Static defenses that can drop bombs.\n   - **Bombs**: Dangerous projectiles that can harm the avatar.\n   - **Planets**: These can restore health or be transformed when interacted with.\n   - **Blackhole**: A passive hazard that kills the avatar on contact but provides a score bonus.\n   - **Background**: Immoveable and serves as the game's scenery.\n \n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can traverse the game area and interact with different sprites to gain benefits (like health or transformation) or face penalties (like health loss from nebula and pom).\n   - The avatar can align with empty planets to transform them into busy planets, indicating resource management and territory control.\n   \n#### Objective\n- **Primary Objective**: The main aim is to reach a point where all blackholes are eliminated while maintaining the avatar's health.\n- **Health Management**: The avatar starts with a limited amount of health points, meaning it needs to avoid damaging interactions.\n- **Maximize Score**: Interacting with blackholes can lead to a potential score increase.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - All blackholes must be eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=blackhole limit=0 win=True).\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar's health reaches zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False).\n  - The player runs out of time (timeout limit=1000 win=False).\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Health Management**: Prioritize interactions that restore health (i.e., planets) and avoid harmful objects (e.g., nebulae and bombs) to stay alive longer.\n2. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to plan movements that avoid turrets and bombs while seeking out planets.\n3. **Resource Transformation**: Utilize empty planets strategically by transforming them into busy planets to create safe zones or generate healing opportunities.\n4. **Control Blackholes Early**: Address blackholes as a priority, as they are the key to winning. Design routes to eliminate them while avoiding damage from turrets or bombs.\n5. **Timing is Key**: Be mindful of the timer; ensure quicker decision-making to mitigate time running out and losing.\n6. **Movement Strategy**: Since there are turrets with bomb capabilities, plan movements to either avoid their line of sight or align with them when they are on cooldown.\n\nBy focusing on strategy aimed at health and resource management, players can position themselves effectively to achieve the game objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To devise a successful strategy, I need to analyze the current state of the game, focusing on the avatar's position relative to hazards and opportunities. \n\nGiven the mechanics, I must ensure my avatar is actively engaging with healing resources, while avoiding harmful elements such as nebulae and turrets.\n\nSince I don't have specific information about the avatar's current location or the surrounding elements, I'll prioritize a safe directional action that could potentially lead towards planets or away from hazards. For a strategic maneuver, I'd choose the action that increases my ability to assess my surroundings.\n\nI'll choose to move the avatar UP. \n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to reposition and evaluate if there are any health-restoring planets or threats nearby. My expectation is that this movement will help me gain a better understanding of my immediate environment, allowing for more effective strategic decisions in subsequent turns.",
