    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game can be categorized as a **strategic survival game with elements of avoidance and resource management**. It involves maintaining health, navigating obstacles, and engaging with moving entities (such as bombs).\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player-controlled character, capable of gaining health and transforming empty planets into busy planets.\n   - **Health Points**: The avatar has a health system (15 out of 20 HP) that can worsen through contact with certain objects (nebula, bombs).\n   - **Items**:\n     - **Bombs**: Dangerous and can cause damage either directly or through their interactions.\n     - **Planets**: Serve as health boosters when interacted with.\n     - **Blackholes**: Act as a potential threat to the avatar but can grant score points if the avatar interacts correctly.\n\n2. **Game Interactions**:\n   - Contact with **nebulae** and **bombs** drains health points.\n   - Aligning with **empty planets** transforms them into **busy planets**, potentially offering resources or benefits.\n   - The presence of **atmosphere** provides a timer adding strategic diversity.\n   - The game ends if the avatar is destroyed or all blackholes are eliminated.\n\n### Objectives\n- Survive for as long as possible, avoiding damage while interacting with sprites to manage health.\n- Transform empty planets into busy ones, possibly to get benefits like healing.\n- Eliminate all blackholes to win, while preventing the avatar's health from reaching zero.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully eliminate all blackholes before timeout.\n- **Loss Condition**: Avatar's health drops to zero or the time limit of 1000 is reached without winning.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of bombs and nebulae to conserve health and prevent an early game over.\n2. **Manage Resources**: Actively seek both empty and busy planets to maintain or improve health as needed.\n3. **Use Timers Wisely**: Utilize the atmosphere to extend actions that may allow you to turn planets while maintaining health.\n4. **Prioritize Blackholes**: Focus on eliminating blackholes whenever possible before they become an existential threat.\n5. **Movement Pattern**: Observe the placement of turrets and bombs to identify safe pathways across the level layout, maximizing movement efficiency while minimizing health risks.\n6. **Positioning**: Keep the avatar at a distance from threats and plan moves around existing safe spots, like busy planets, for healing opportunities.\n\nIn essence, players will need to utilize strategic movement and resource management to navigate the level's hazards, maintain the avatar's health, and reach the goal of eliminating the blackholes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
