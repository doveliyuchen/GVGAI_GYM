Players control an avatar (ship) in a potentially hostile environment filled with hazards (bombs, turrets, blackholes) and opportunities (empty planets for resource collection).\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites/Units**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled spaceship with health points. Moving and interacting with other sprites is key to survival.\n   - **Turrets**: They fire bombs that can damage the player's avatar. The randomness in bomb deployment can create strategic challenges.\n   - **Blackholes**: They kill the player's avatar but can also yield a point when the player interacts with them\u2014indicating a unique mechanic that incentivizes risky behavior.\n   - **Planets**: Empty planets can be transformed for health benefits, while busy planets don't provide interaction.\n   - **Nebulas**: These areas cause damage if the avatar interacts with them.\n   - **Bombs**: These serve as hazards and can deal damage to the avatar.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Damage is a primary concern, with various sprites inflicting damage on the avatar.\n   - The player can gain health by interacting with empty planets and can convert them into busy planets upon interaction.\n   - The blackhole mechanic introduces a risk-reward system\u2014the player may be tempted to interact for scoring, but at the cost of high risk.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective appears to be survival; keep the avatar alive while navigating the environment.\n- Collect health from empty planets and avoid interaction with harmful entities like bombs, turrets, and blackholes.\n- The objective also includes managing the number of sprites on the screen, particularly blackholes to achieve a win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the number of blackholes reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (its count reaches zero) or if there is a timeout (i.e., if the game clock reaches a limit of 1000).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Movement and Navigation**:\n   - Stay mobile. Since the avatar has a low speed, careful and strategic movement will help avoid bombs and turrets.\n   - Learn the layout to identify safe zones and danger areas.\n\n2. **Health Management**:\n   - Prioritize heading to empty planets to build health reserves. After transforming them into busy planets, periodically return for healing, if necessary.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Keep a safe distance from turrets and bombs. If they attract your gaze, be ready to navigate away quickly.\n   - Plan interactions with blackholes cautiously, weighing the risks against the potential score gain.\n\n4. **Sprite Control**:\n   - Limit the number of blackholes on the field; try to avoid situations where multiple hazards converge on the avatar.\n   - Use bombs strategically if they can be used to eliminate threats or if they can be avoided.\n\n5. **Time Management**:\n   - Be aware of the time limit. If there are opportunities to gain health or eliminate threats effectively, prioritize these actions to ensure survival as the time dwindles.\n\n6. **Situational Awareness**:\n   - Always keep an eye on health points; don\u2019t hesitate to retreat to safer areas to heal when necessary. \n\nThis blend of evasion, health management, and strategic interactions with the environment will enhance the chances of success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
