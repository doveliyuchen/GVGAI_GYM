    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a 2D action-adventure game with elements of combat and survival mechanics, likely set in a space or sci-fi environment based on the sprites and layout provided.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar:** Represents the player\u2019s character, capable of movement and interaction with various game elements. It has health points and a speed attribute.\n   - **Obstacles:** Include nebulae (damaging), turrets (hostile), planets (health-giving), and black holes (instant death).\n   - **Bombs:** Act as projectiles that can damage the player and should be avoided.\n   - **Planets:** Serve as safe zones where players can regenerate health (empty planet transforms into busy planet).\n   - **Atmosphere:** A passive element that provides a time-limited effect, potentially to change planets back to empty ones.\n   - **Black Hole:** An immediate danger that can kill the avatar if they come into contact with it.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player interacts with environmental elements (e.g., bombs, planets, nebulae) that can both help and hinder their progress.\n   - Damage can be taken from collisions with bombs or nebulae, while being near planets can be beneficial for health restoration.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary goal is to avoid dying (represented by the avatar's health) and try to eliminate black holes (presumably obstacles or enemies) before time runs out.\n- The player must also manage their health strategically by utilizing planets while surviving attacks.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** If all black holes are eliminated before any avatars (player characters) are destroyed.\n- **Loss:** Occurs if the player's avatars are all eliminated or if time runs out (timeout condition).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Movement and Positioning:**\n   - Keep the avatar moving to prevent being hit by bombs or other enemies. Utilize the slower speed of the bombs to your advantage to dodge them.\n   - Position your avatar near health-restoring planets whenever possible, especially after taking damage.\n\n2. **Utilize Planets:**\n   - Actively interact with empty planets to transform them into busy planets for healing. This gives you a buffer against damage.\n   - Pay attention to the health system. Always monitor your health points and find opportunities to heal before they run low.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - Be aware of nebulae that can cause damage. Try to avoid them while traversing the level.\n   - Take note of turret locations and their cooldown mechanics. If turrets are predictable, you can time your movements to avoid their fire.\n\n4. **Engagement with Black Holes:**\n   - If black holes can be attacked or defeated, prioritize them in your strategy as eliminating them directly contributes to your win condition.\n   - If black holes are passive and only harmful, avoid them at all costs as touching one results in instant death.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - While exploring, be aware of the time limit and try to balance exploration with effective action (eliminating hazards) so you still have time left to focus on black holes at the end.\n\nIn summary, the player should adopt a careful and strategic approach, balancing exploration and health management while actively engaging hazards to achieve victory in this space-themed adventure game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

Since the current position will determine my next action, I will focus on analyzing my surroundings and potential immediate threats (like black holes or turrets) as well as opportunities (like nearby planets).\n\nWithout any specific details on the avatar's current position or surrounding elements, I will initiate a movement action to gain information on the layout. I'll move in one direction to see if there are any immediate hazards or helpful elements nearby.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this action will reveal additional information about my surroundings while allowing me to reposition my avatar to avoid potential threats and strategize for future moves.",
