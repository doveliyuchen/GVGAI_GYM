    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **top-down arcade-style shooter** with exploration and resource management elements. The player controls an avatar (spaceship) and must navigate a limited map filled with various interactive elements.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Movement and Navigation**: The avatar moves within a structured environment, presumably avoiding obstacles and engaging with specific sprites.\n- **Health Management**: The avatar starts with a set amount of health points and can gain or lose health through interactions.\n- **Resource Interaction**: \n  - The avatar can transform empty planets into busy planets, likely indicating resource gathering or collection.\n  - There are threats such as bombs that can damage the avatar and a blackhole that can result in instantaneous death.\n  - Bullets or projectiles from turrets will also interact with the avatar, creating an element of risk.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be to eliminate all blackholes (by ensuring their limit is 0), while managing health and navigating around other hazards (like bombs and turrets).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the sprite counter for blackholes reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - If the avatar's sprite counter reaches zero (suggesting the player has lost all their health or been killed), they lose.\n  - If the game exceeds a time limit of 1000 units without achieving the win condition, they also lose.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**: Prioritize collecting health from planets to sustain your avatar, especially when navigating areas with threats.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay mindful of bomb sprites and turrets that can inflict damage. Try to use the environment to navigate around them without taking hits.\n3. **Resource Collection**: Use empty planets strategically; convert them into busy planets for potential health or other resource benefits.\n4. **Target Blackholes**: The primary goal is to eliminate blackholes. Focus on identifying their locations and ensuring that they are dealt with promptly to achieve the victory condition. Consider using strategic movement and dodging to evade damage while focusing on this goal.\n5. **Time Management**: Keep track of the timer and ensure you are making efficient moves to avoid running out of time. Avoid unnecessary encounters that may lead to damage without strategic gain.\n6. **Smart Dodging and Positioning**: Use the map layout keenly, avoiding densely packed areas with turrets and hazards while creating opportunities to move into areas with more favorable health resources (busy planets). \n\nBy integrating these strategies and considerations, players may effectively navigate through challenges, manage health, and ultimately work towards victory against the blackholes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To make a decision based on the provided game rules and strategies, I first need to analyze the current state of the game to determine the avatar's position, health status, blackhole location, and any nearby threats like bombs or turrets.\n\nHowever, since I don't have the specific details of the avatar's current position or surrounding elements, I will proceed with a generalized action plan first. I will initiate a move to the left since exploring the perimeter often helps in understanding the layout, identifying resources, and gauging if there are any threats.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect moving left will either help me find resources or avoid threats, aligning with the strategy to manage health effectively while looking for blackholes.",
