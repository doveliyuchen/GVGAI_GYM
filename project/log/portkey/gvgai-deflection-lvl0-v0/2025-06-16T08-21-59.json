    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game appears to belong to the action-adventure genre with space exploration and survival elements, featuring elements of resource management (health points) and strategic movement (interaction with different sprites).\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites/Elements**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character (spaceship) that moves and interacts with other objects. Has health points and speed attributes.\n   - **Turrets and Bombs**: These pose threats to the avatar and affect gameplay through damage (subtracting health points) and attraction of movement.\n   - **Planets and Atmosphere**: The avatar can interact with these to gain health or change states (busy/empty).\n   - **Black Hole**: Represents a termination risk for the avatar and a scoring opportunity.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Collision with certain sprites leads to health loss or gain.\n   - The avatar can change the state of planets and manage health through strategic movement.\n   - The presence of a timer indicates a time-sensitive element in gameplay.\n\n#### Objective:\n- Survive by managing health points while navigating through the environment.\n- Transform empty planets into busy ones to potentially capitalize on them for health recovery or score.\n- Avoid turrets, bombs, and black holes, while trying to eliminate or avoid all avatars.\n- Aim to survive the designated timeframe while keeping the avatar alive until a certain condition related to black holes is met.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Successfully managing to keep the avatar alive while eliminating all black holes.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar\u2019s health points reaching zero.\n  - Timeout occurring (1000 time units).\n  - Not managing to eliminate all black holes before the avatar is lost.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Health Management**: Prioritize interactions that restore health by visiting busy planets.\n  \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of turrets and bombs; their attacks can quickly deplete your health points. Position the avatar strategically to dodge these threats effectively.\n\n3. **Use the Environment**:\n   - Transform empty planets into busy ones to increase opportunities for health restoration.\n   - Utilize the black holes strategically, as they can provide a score boost if managed correctly.\n\n4. **Efficient Movement**: With a relatively low speed (0.5), ensure that movements are deliberate and calculated to evade threats. Focus on space management to navigate through obstacles and exploit safer paths.\n\n5. **Time Awareness**: Keep track of the remaining time and make sure to engage with strategic moves that align with maximizing health while also decreasing black holes before the timer runs out.\n\n6. **Plan Turret Engagements**: If possible, engage in situations where you might use turrets to your advantage while minimizing personal risk.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of victory while minimizing the risks of health loss and game termination conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To begin with, I need to understand the current position of my avatar and assess the surrounding environment for hazards or opportunities (like busy or empty planets, turrets, bombs, and black holes). Without knowing my current position or the relevant elements in the vicinity, I cannot accurately determine the most strategic action to take.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can select an action that aligns with managing my health effectively while avoiding threats and utilizing the environment to my advantage. \n\nSince my avatar position is crucial, I will analyze the state first, without making any immediate moves to gather more information.\n\n``` Action:0 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to gather more information and analyze the state of the game before making any moves, adhering to the strategy of taking deliberate and informed actions.",
