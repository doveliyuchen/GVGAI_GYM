Survive by managing health points.\n2. Transform as many empty planets to busy planets as possible to extend gameplay or gain advantages.\n3. Avoid hazards such as nebulae, bombs, and black holes.\n4. Collect enough score points through proper interactions, particularly focusing on the black holes and busy planets.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if the black hole sprite count reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The game is lost if the avatar's count reaches zero or if the timer runs out after 1000 ticks.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Health Management:** Keep an eye on health points and prioritize interactions with planets to restore health. Avoid contact with hazardous sprites like nebulae and bombs.\n2. **Avoid Bombs:** Since bombs can damage the avatar or force it to attract gaze, maneuver skillfully to avoid them and manage turret placements.\n3. **Utilize Black Holes:** Use black holes strategically to increase score, but be cautious of their positioning.\n4. **Planet Transformation:** Focus on finding and transforming empty planets into busy ones; this could be beneficial for score and might provide health restoration.\n5. **Tactical Movement:** Plan the avatar's path carefully to navigate the level efficiently, avoiding enemy sprites and maximizing the movement towards beneficial interactions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUnderstanding the mechanics and interactions of the game is essential to mastering it. Players should focus on managing health and leveraging the environment while avoiding hazardous sprites to ultimately achieve victory by eliminating the black holes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

The key is to navigate away from hazardous sprites (nebulae and bombs) while focusing on health management and transforming empty planets into busy ones.\n\nOnce I understand the layout, I'll take action aimed at moving towards advantageous sprites, particularly empty planets for transformation and maintaining health. \n\nSince you have mentioned that the position hasn't changed from the last state, I will carefully analyze the surroundings. \n\nGiven the current state,\n\n``` Action: 0 ```\nThis action will allow for reevaluation of the current state without moving, giving me the chance to proceed with a better plan afterward.",
