    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, it appears to be a puzzle or strategy game with elements of exploration and interaction. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the components:\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Genre**: Puzzle/Strategy\n- The game involves moving components (sprites) around a grid-like map and interacting with various objects to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different elements, including walls, water, goals, avatars (players), and direction indicators.\n- **Movement**: The player uses an avatar that can face in different directions (north, south, east, west) and can interact with other sprites like the catapult and walls.\n- **Shooting Mechanic**: The avatar can shoot bullets that interact with walls to transform them into moving objects, which likely can aid in solving puzzles or clearing paths.\n- **Attractions**: The catapult attracts the avatar's attention, hinting at a tactical element where it may need to be utilized to progress.\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won by reaching the 'goal' sprite, while failing to manage the avatars results in a loss.\n\n### Objective\n- **Goal**: The primary objective is to guide the avatar to the 'goal' sprite, while possibly navigating through or around obstacles.\n- **Score Mechanics**: The interaction between the avatar and the catapult results in a scoring change, which could indicate a need to maximize score as a secondary objective.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The game is won when there are no remaining 'goal' sprites, and it is lost when all avatars are eliminated. Maintaining at least one avatar is crucial for success.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation & Positioning**: Start by analyzing the level layout and positioning of all moving parts. Use the avatar to face the correct direction at strategic points to maximize movement options.\n  \n2. **Utilize Movement Mechanic**: Attack the wall sprites with bullets to convert them into moving sprites. Use this to your advantage to clear paths or block enemies.\n\n3. **Attraction of Catapult**: Pay attention to the catapult. Move the avatar towards it to understand how it can be utilized \u2013 possibly to clear obstacles or create openings to the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Path to Goal**: Look for the most unobstructed paths to the goal while managing the limited number of avatars. Avoiding water sprites and ensuring the avatar is not killed by environmental hazards is essential.\n\n5. **Manage Sprite Count**: Keep track of the number of avatars and eliminate unnecessary positions that may lead the avatar into traps or water.\n\n6. **Use West/South/East/North Directions Wisely**: Change the avatar\u2019s facing direction to improve access to different paths as you gather information about sprite interactions and layout.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: Since this is a puzzle game, be prepared to experiment with different configurations and strategies. Learn from each attempt, as certain moves may open up new strategies.\n\nBy carefully navigating through the game's rules and leveraging your control over the avatar and interactions with the environment, you can effectively aim for the goal while managing resources (avatars) and maximizing scoring opportunities.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

To effectively analyze the situation and plan towards the goal, it's essential to consider the surroundings of the avatar.\n\n1. **Observation of Surroundings**:\n   - The avatar can move in four directions: left to (1,0), right to (1,2), down to (2,1), and up to (0,1).\n   - The immediate left to (1,0) is a wall ('*').\n   - The immediate right (1,2) is a floor ('.').\n   - The down direction (2,1) is water ('e'), which would eliminate the avatar if moved into.\n   - The up direction (0,1) is also a wall ('*').\n\n**Next Steps**: The only available movement option is to the right (1,2), which is free and doesn't lead into any traps. This action will not only allow the avatar to keep progressing but will also set us up to potentially shoot the wall directly after.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar to the right towards an open space, allowing for future strategic options while moving towards the goal.",
