    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a strategy for effective gameplay.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game can be categorized as a **puzzle-action game**. It involves interacting with various sprites (characters and objects) to achieve a goal, while also navigating hazards and obstacles.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The key characters and objects in the game are categorized as immovable or movable. The main sprites are:\n   - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character.\n   - **Catapult**: Likely a mechanism that interacts with the avatar.\n   - **Bullets**: Projectiles that interact with walls and the avatar.\n   - **Obstacles**: Walls, water hazards, and the goal.\n\n2. **Movements and Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can face different directions (north, south, east, west), which impacts how it can interact with other elements.\n   - The avatar can transform into different sprites based on its orientation.\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can be killed by water or catapults.\n   - The bullet can transform walls into moving objects, possibly creating pathways.\n   - The goal must be reached to win.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the **goal** sprite while managing the movements and interactions of the avatar and obstacles. Collecting scores from interactions with the catapult enhances the player's progress in the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game if there are no instances of the goal sprite left, as indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True`.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Your Surroundings**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout and know where the walls, water, and catapults are to avoid unintended deaths.\n\n2. **Use the Bullet Wisely**: Transform walls into moving entities by using bullets. This could create new paths and opportunities for movement.\n\n3. **Manage Directional Facing**: Always be conscious of the avatar's facing direction. Changing the avatar's direction can aid in navigating the level effectively, especially to face different hazards strategically.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of water and catapults as they can negatively impact your avatar's status. Calculate your moves to ensure safe paths.\n\n5. **Prioritize the Goal**: Focus on reaching the goal sprite efficiently without losing the avatar. Keep track of how many avatars you have left to avoid game over.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead**: As the game involves puzzle-like elements, planning your movements and actions ahead of time can help in tackling complex layouts.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, players can maximize their chances of winning and advancing through the game levels effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
