    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n**Game Analysis**\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle or action-adventure game with elements that hint at platforming and strategy, possibly situated in a 2D grid-based environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game utilizes various sprites representing floors, waters, walls, bullets, and the avatar, among others. Each has unique properties, such as immovability or movement.\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar can face four directions (north, south, east, west) and its facing direction can change based on interactions.\n- **Interactivity:** The avatar can interact with various elements:\n  - The catapult can kill the avatar, and it seems to have a score-changing aspect when interacting with the avatar.\n  - The bullet can interact with walls and cause movement.\n  - Moving into or across water results in the avatar's death.\n  - The avatar can reach a goal, which seems to be the primary objective.\n- **Transformations:** The avatar can change its state based on its facing direction, which may affect strategy.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is for the avatar to reach the 'goal' sprite while avoiding walls and water, and potentially using a catapult to solve puzzles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no goal sprites left (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Navigation:** Players should focus on navigating efficiently through the level by carefully planning their movements to avoid walls and water traps.\n   \n2. **Utilizing Directional Changes:** Make use of the ability to face different directions to manage interactions with the environment, especially when maneuvering around walls and the catapult.\n\n3. **Puzzles with Catapult:** Identify moments when the catapult can be used to your advantage. This may involve luring the avatar into position to be impacted by the catapult or using it strategically to reach the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Water:** Steer clear of water at all costs since it leads to instant death. Map out safe paths early in the level.\n\n5. **Plan Each Move:** As the layout contains dangers and potential traps, each move should be calculated. Think ahead about the outcome of every interaction, ensuring to avoid situations that lead the avatar into walls or back into water.\n\nBy considering these strategies, players can maximize their chances of navigating the level successfully and achieving the game\u2019s win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state, my avatar (@) is located at (1, 1) and can face east. The surrounding environment consists of walls (*) and water (e), which means careful navigation is essential. There is also a goal (#) at (14, 7) that needs to be reached.\n\nBased on the game rules and strategies outlined, my immediate goal is to move the avatar closer to the goal while avoiding water and walls. The primary movement options from (1, 1) would be to move right to (1, 2), which is a water tile and would result in my avatar's death, or to move downward to (2, 1) where there is more water. Instead, to make progress towards the goal and avoiding any immediate danger, I should consider moving:\n\n1. **Rotating towards DOWN** (as downward movement is necessary to explore further safely).\n2. After the rotation, I will then try moving down again to see if I can navigate through safely.\n\nLet me take the first step by trying to face a direction that allows me to eventually move down to explore more:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis is an action to face downward and then to analyze the new position. The expectation is to reach a safe area or discover new paths towards the goal.",
