    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game appears to be a **top-down puzzle or strategy game** that involves navigating a character (often referred to as 'avatar') through a grid-like environment filled with obstacles, with specific goals and mechanics concerning movement and interaction.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Environment**: The game features various types of immovable sprites like walls, water, a goal, and floors. Some are solid (walls) and blocking paths, while others might have effects (water kills sprites).\n   - **Entities**: There are player-controlled elements like the avatar and the catapult, which interact with other sprites.\n   - **Directions**: The avatar can face and move in different directions (north, south, east, west).\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can change its orientation to face any of the four cardinal directions.\n   - Interaction with the catapult leads to the avatar being 'killed' (which presumably removes the player from that round) and awarding points.\n   - The avatar can transform into \"moving\" sprites based on direction, which could suggest a mechanic for puzzle-solving as it navigates through the map.\n   - The goal sprite can be reached, terminating the game with a win.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game is won if there are no 'goal' sprites remaining (indicating all goals have been achieved).\n   - The game is lost if the avatar count reaches zero, suggesting the player's character(s) are eliminated.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level, reaching the goal while avoiding threats like water and interacting correctly with the catapult. The player must strategize their moves to prevent losing the avatar while achieving level-specific goals.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: All instances of the 'goal' sprite must be eliminated or reached by the avatar(s).\n- **Loss Condition**: If all avatars are eliminated (avatar count reaches zero), the player loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout and identify safe paths that lead to the goal while avoiding hazards like water.\n   \n2. **Utilize Directions Wisely**: Change the avatar's orientation strategically to either move towards the goal or create opportunities to use the catapult effectively.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the water's representation and avoid it at all costs, as it will instantly eliminate your avatar.\n\n4. **Leverage the Catapult**: Use the catapult to your advantage, but avoid being eliminated by its effects. Timing your interactions is crucial here.\n\n5. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Since the game appears to be a puzzle, think several moves ahead to avoid entrapment. This may involve moving an avatar in particular directions to manipulate the movement of other sprites or to bring them into range of the catapult.\n\n6. **Monitor Avatar Life**: Keep an eye on the number of available avatars. If they're diminished too quickly, it may lead to unnecessary losses.\n\nBy integrating these strategies and responding dynamically to situations in the game, the player can enhance their chances of success in reaching goals and completing levels effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
