    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and suggest an overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-adventure or maze game where players navigate a grid-like environment, interact with various objects (sprites), and potentially solve problems to achieve specific goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include walls, water, and the goal. They restrict movement and influence player attempts to navigate through the level.\n   - **Moving Sprites:** The player avatar can transform into directional sprites (north, south, east, west) to navigate in different directions.\n   - **Interaction Mechanics:**\n     - **Avatar Transformations** based on its orientation (north, south, east, west) enable the player to control directionality.\n     - **Catapult:** Interacting with the catapult appears to attract the attention of the avatar. This could be a mechanic to manipulate the avatar\u2019s actions or progression.\n     - **Destructive Interactions:** Bullets can interact with the wall and water, leading to destruction or \"killing\" certain sprites, affecting gameplay.\n\n2. **Movement Constraints:** \n   - The water kills the avatar, while walls prevent movement. Players must navigate carefully, using the environment to their advantage.\n\n### Objectives\nThe primary objective is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite while avoiding interactions that lead to getting \"killed\". Collecting points may be achieved through catapult interaction, although it's unclear if this is a requirement or an optional action.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if the 'goal' sprite is touched, reducing its SpriteCounter to zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, suggesting crucial importance in preserving the avatar's life.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigational Awareness:** \n   - Carefully navigate through obstacles while being cognizant of walls (which can block movement) and water (which can kill the avatar).\n   - Utilize the catapult strategically to manipulate your avatar\u2019s movements or to deal with walls.\n\n2. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Look for open paths while avoiding water and walls. Aim to move towards the 'goal' while considering the transformation mechanic for directional movement.\n   - Utilize the directions effectively based on environmental awareness around you.\n\n3. **Resource Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the avatar count; avoid unnecessary risks that can lead to the avatar's demise.\n   - Analyzing level layout can help in determining which obstacles can be avoided or manipulated to clear a path.\n\nBy combining analytical thinking with strategic movement, players can successfully navigate through the game, ultimately reaching the goal while managing interactions with the environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
