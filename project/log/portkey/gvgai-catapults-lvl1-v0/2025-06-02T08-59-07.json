The game implies some scoring system where the player can gain points, potentially from interacting with the catapult or avoiding obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The player wins if all goal sprites are eliminated (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0).\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Navigating Hazards:** \n   - Avoid the water, as it kills any moving sprites. Carefully chart your path to ensure that the avatar does not inadvertently move into the water.\n\n2. **Utilizing the Catapult:**\n   - The catapult seems to play a crucial role in reaching the goal. Attract the catapult\u2019s attention while figuring out how to lead it to advantageous positions.\n\n3. **Orientation Changes:**\n   - Use the directional sprites (northfacing, southfacing, etc.) strategically to change the avatar's orientation as needed to navigate around walls and obstacles without getting stuck.\n\n4. **Clearing Walls:**\n   - Utilize the bullet sprites to interact with walls, effectively removing obstacles that might block the pathway to the goal.\n\n5. **Score Management:**\n   - Consider the interaction between the avatar and the catapult to maximize scores while moving strategically towards the goal.\n\n6. **Planning Moves:**\n   - Given the layout, observe the positioning of various sprites. Predict how moving the avatar or interacting with other sprites affects the overall environment to maintain control of the game.\n\nBy carefully observing and utilizing interactions and sprite placements, players can successfully navigate the levels toward victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

The goal is to navigate the avatar towards the goal sprites 'g' located at (5, 12), (11, 14), and (14, 7). There are several water obstacles represented by 'e' that must be avoided.\n\nThe strategy involves careful navigation around walls and water, utilizing the catapult to help clear paths where necessary, and managing the avatar's positioning for optimal advancement towards the goal.\n\nGiven the options available and the current position of the avatar, it is essential for the avatar to first change orientation towards the right (east) to align with the intended movement direction.\n\nHowever, I'm currently unsure if an immediate movement can be executed toward the goal if the avatar is still facing east. Since the avatar is on 'eastfacing floor', I will first attempt a right movement to see if it can move further toward the goal directly.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis should allow the avatar to attempt moving right, expecting to progress towards the path leading closer to the rows with goal sprites while evaluating any interaction with further obstacles or catapult mechanics.",
