    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the given game rules and level layout, here\u2019s the analysis:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to fall into the **puzzle** or **strategy** genre. It involves navigating a player-controlled sprite (the avatar) through a grid-like layout, dealing with obstacles and using interactions to achieve objectives.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Movement:**\n   - **Avatar:** The main character that the player controls.\n   - **Catapult:** Acts as a mechanism to interact with the avatar, potentially providing an ability to shoot or spawn entities.\n   - **Walls and Water:** These act as obstacles; walls block movement, while water is deadly and can result in the avatar's demise.\n   - **Goals:** The objective clearly states that reaching the goal will end the game.\n\n2. **Directional Facing:**\n   - The avatar can face in different cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), which is important for orienting interactions (e.g., the avatar can interact differently when facing specific directions).\n\n3. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with the environment:\n     - **Transforming:** The avatar may change orientation or state based on interactions with walls and the direction it faces.\n     - **Winning Conditions:** If the avatar reaches the goal, the game ends successfully. \n     - **Death Conditions:** Falling into water or losing the avatar results in failure.\n\n### Objectives:\n- Navigate the avatar through the level while avoiding water and walls, ultimately reaching the green goal sprite.\n- Achieve a score by potentially interacting with the catapult.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite.\n- **Losing:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed, either by encountering water or if the avatar is otherwise removed from play.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Navigation Planning:**\n   - Plan your route carefully to avoid water hazards while looking for paths around walls. Use the layout to your advantage, noting areas where movement could be restricted by walls or water.\n\n2. **Use of Directions:**\n   - Always pay attention to the orientation of your avatar, as different interactions are dependent on the direction you are facing. Turning the avatar to face specific directions may open new pathways or change the gameplay dynamics positively.\n\n3. **Interactions with the Catapult:**\n   - If the catapult can alter the state of the avatar or interact with specific walls, consider using it wisely for potential route changes or to alter encounters with the environment.\n\n4. **Precaution Around Water:**\n   - Keep a safe distance from water edges and plan your movement to avoid any sudden interactions that could lead to the avatar's demise.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Since this is a puzzle game, be prepared to experiment with different paths and interactions to discover the optimal route to reach the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, a player can effectively navigate the level, minimize risks, and optimize their chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

There are pathways that could potentially lead to the goal from the current position.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\nThe immediate objective is to safely navigate towards the goal while avoiding water and walls. Given the surrounding area, I should focus on using the available actions to either move right into an available floor space and then strategize further from there.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the avatar can only access immediately to the right (1, 2) which is a safe floor (.) and explore options:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThe expectation is to move into (1, 2) and reassess the position and available moves towards the goal, adhering to the strategies and safety considerations outlined.",
