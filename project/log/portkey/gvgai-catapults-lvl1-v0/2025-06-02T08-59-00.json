Players likely need to navigate a series of obstacles and enemies while solving spatial challenges, primarily using movement and tactical decision-making.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various elements such as the avatar, walls, catapults, goals, and bullets are present, each serving a specific function.\n2. **Movement**: The avatar can change orientation and interact with the environment, indicating a need for spatial awareness and directional movement.\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - **Wall Interactions**: Moving can affect walls, suggesting players will need to manipulate their surroundings to progress.\n   - **Avatar and Catapult**: The avatar can be killed by the catapult, which serves as both an obstacle and potentially a means of forcing the player to rethink their path.\n   - **Goals**: Goals must be reached, and the avatar must avoid hazards to achieve them.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to a designated goal while avoiding death from walls (if they're moving), the catapult, and water. Players need to manage their movements to reach the goal efficiently:\n\n1. **Reach the \"goal\" sprite**: This earns points and ends the game successfully.\n2. **Avoid losing the avatar**: The game ends in failure if the avatar is destroyed before reaching the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if they can navigate to the goal sprite with at least one avatar remaining.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if all avatars are destroyed before reaching the goal. Keeping track of avatars and avoiding their removal is crucial.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Movements**: Before executing actions, plan each move carefully, considering the potential effects of walls, the catapult, and other sprites on your avatar's movements.\n2. **Angle Awareness**: Change the avatar's orientation tactically to maneuver through walls and line up shots with the bullet if applicable.\n3. **Utilize Catapults Wisely**: Be cautious with catapults. It may be wise to use them strategically to interfere with walls or to redirect obstacles.\n4. **Keep Distance from Water**: Stay clear of the water unless you are confident in your movement plan, as it will eliminate your avatar if they move into it.\n5. **Count Resources**: Be mindful of the number of avatars you have remaining. Prioritize safety to prevent losing them, particularly when navigating encounters with walls or projectiles.\n\nOverall, players will need a mix of strategic planning, spatial reasoning, and quick adaptability to win this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

The immediate environment has walls to the north (0, 1), west (1, 0), east (1, 2), and southeast (2, 2). \n\nThe goal is located at (7, 7) on the map, which is quite distant from the avatar's position. However, there are pathways available in the direction of the southeast as there's an eastward (1, 2) and southward (2, 1) space.\n\nSince the currently available movements include:\n\n- LEFT (1, 0) is blocked by a wall\n- RIGHT (1, 2) is an open floor that can be moved into\n- DOWN (2, 1) is an open floor and also can be accessed, \n- UP (0, 1) is blocked by a wall.\n\nThus, the most logical action that allows movement is to proceed south which will keep the avatar alive and allow us to navigate closer towards our goal.\n\nThe selected action is:\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action represents a move down, which is strategically sound since it keeps the avatar safe while advancing towards the goal.",
