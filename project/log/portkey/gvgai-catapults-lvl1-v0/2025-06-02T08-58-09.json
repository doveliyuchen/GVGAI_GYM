Players need to navigate the environment while overcoming obstacles to achieve specific goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game features various sprites, including immovable objects (e.g., walls, floor, water), characters (avatar, moving), projectiles (bullets), and goal objects. \n- **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can change orientation and manipulate its movement direction. The game utilizes projectiles (bullets) that can interact with walls and obstacles, allowing for strategic positioning.\n- **Collision and Effects:** Different interactions lead to various outcomes: projectiles destroy walls, avatars face certain consequences when they reach a catapult or water, and a goal is achieved when the avatar collides with the goal sprite.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to maneuver the avatar to reach the \"goal\" sprite while avoiding hazards like water. The player also needs to navigate around walls and use the catapult effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when there are no remaining goal sprites (SpriteCounter for goal reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite count drops to 0 (indicating that the player has lost all avatars).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Familiarize with Sprite Locations:** \n   - Understanding the layout (walls, water, goals) is crucial. The provided level layout map shows walls and potential moves, so be mindful of where obstacles are placed.\n\n2. **Use the Catapult Effectively:**\n   - The catapult can \"kill\" the avatar sprite upon interaction, which could be used for strategic placement or to trigger certain events. Utilize it wisely to either reach goals or clear obstacles.\n\n3. **Manipulate Orientation:**\n   - Changing the direction of the avatar (using north/south/east/west facing tiles) will influence movement direction. Each direction aspect should be considered to navigate effectively toward the goal.\n\n4. **Projectile Strategy:**\n   - Utilize the bullet to break through walls. You may need to shoot projectiles strategically to clear a path if certain walls block your way. Beware of the water as it will eliminate your sprite if you interact with it.\n\n5. **Manage Avatar Count:**\n   - Pay attention to avoiding situations that lead to losing avatars, especially near hazards (like water). Ensure you've evaluated potential paths before committing to a move.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:**\n   - Always think several moves ahead. Since certain actions can lead to losing an avatar or creating other obstacles, planning can prevent inevitable failures.\n\nBy combining these strategies and considering the interactions and mechanics, players can effectively navigate through the game's challenges. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

The primary way forward without hitting hazards is either moving right to (1, 2) or down to (2, 1), but moving down may lead to water further south.\n\nBased on the positioning and the advice about manipulating orientation, I should begin by moving the avatar in a direction that does not immediately result in hitting an obstacle or hazard.\n\n### Action Plan:\nSince the next cell to the right (1, 2) is clear (indicated by a '.'), I will move right to avoid possible hazards below.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right is a strategic first step toward navigating towards the goal while avoiding immediate hazards.
