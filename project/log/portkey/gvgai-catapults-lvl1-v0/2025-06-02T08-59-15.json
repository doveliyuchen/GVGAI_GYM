    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThe game appears to belong to the puzzle or action-adventure genre, featuring spatial navigation, strategic interactions, and possibly some combat elements.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** There are various sprites representing different game objects:\n   - **Floor, Water, Walls:** These define the environment, impacting player movement and interactions.\n   - **Catapult:** Likely a mechanism that interacts with the avatar (player).\n   - **Avatar and Movement Indicators:** The player has a customizable avatar with directional orientations (north, south, east, west) that affect how the avatar interacts with the environment.\n   - **Goal:** This sprite likely represents an objective the player must reach.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can transform orientation or interact with other sprites like catapults or bullets.\n   - Water is lethal, and encountering it kills the avatar.\n   - There are bullet mechanics that involve walls, indicating some form of active combat or defenses.\n   - The catapult kills the avatar but also appears to provide some score advantage when the catapult interacts with the avatar.\n\n3. **Movement Mechanics:** \n   - The player likely navigates through a top-down or isometric view, moving in four cardinal directions defined by the orientation sprites.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is likely to reach the \"goal\" while avoiding water and managing interactions with other sprites, particularly the catapult and bullets. The game tracks the avatar's and goal's sprite counts to determine victory or defeat.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the counter for the \"goal\" sprite reaches zero, indicating the avatar has successfully navigated to the goal without losses.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game results in a fail condition if the avatar\u2019s count reaches zero, meaning the player has lost all avatars or failed to progress.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Navigating the Environment:** Begin by carefully analyzing the layout. Identify potential pathways and avoid areas containing water and enemy interactions.\n\n2. **Utilizing the Catapult:** If it seems beneficial, strategize to use the catapult's interactions wisely, potentially to eliminate threats or attract the gaze, while being aware of the risk of losing your avatar.\n\n3. **Direction and Positioning:** Constantly change the avatar's orientation to navigate effectively, taking advantage of the directional sprites to create a clear path toward the goal.\n\n4. **Avoiding Hazards:** Stay away from moving water and walls unless using bullets to clear them. This focus on survival ensures the avatar remains in play long enough to reach the goal.\n\n5. **Goal Prioritization:** Throughout gameplay, maintain focus on your end goal. As you manage your avatar's interactions, keep watching the sprite counts to ensure you're on track to win.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, players can navigate through the levels with enhanced efficiency, minimizing losses while optimizing the journey toward the objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
