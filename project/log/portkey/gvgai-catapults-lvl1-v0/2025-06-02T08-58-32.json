    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nBased on the description and mechanics, this game appears to fall into the **puzzle-adventure** genre, incorporating elements of strategy and possibly action with the movement and shooting mechanics.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game features different types of sprites including walls, water, catapults, the player avatar, bullets (which serve as projectiles), and a goal.\n- **Movement and Transformation:** The player's avatar can face different directions, allowing for strategic movement, and can transform into directional sprites (north, south, east, west) depending on its orientation. \n- **Interactions:** \n  - Bullets can destroy walls but not vice versa; moving walls push back the player.\n  - The player's avatar interacts with the catapult, which could be a moving or shooting mechanism that leads to scoring.\n  - Water serves as an obstacle that kills the avatar upon contact.\n  - The goal sprite signifies the end of the level.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, overcoming obstacles (water and walls) to reach the goal. The player must avoid being killed by water and must manage the use of the catapult to clear paths or manipulate the movement of sprites.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- Win: The player wins by having no goal sprites left (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- Loss: The player loses when there are no avatars left to control (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand the Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout. Note the locations of the walls, water, and the goal.\n\n2. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Use directional movements wisely. Only face the direction where there is a clear path and avoid aggressive maneuvers that can lead directly into water.\n\n3. **Leverage the Catapult:**\n   - Identify opportunities to use the catapult effectively to clear obstacles (walls) or create paths to advance toward the goal.\n\n4. **Use Bullets Strategically:**\n   - Fire bullets at walls to create openings. Keep track of the number of moves you have, ensuring you do not get blocked off as you navigate the maze.\n\n5. **Avoid Water:**\n   - Stay away from water sprites, as colliding with them results in losing sprites which could affect your progress toward winning.\n\n6. **Incremental Progress:**\n   - Make small, calculated movements instead of rushing through the level, allowing for adjustments based on how walls and obstacles react.\n\n7. **Keep an Eye on Scoring:**\n   - Aim for actions that clear walls and potentially score points. The score may contribute to unlocking further levels or enhancing successful play.\n\nBy carefully considering movement, leveraging the catapult effectively, and maintaining awareness of surrounding obstacles, players can successfully navigate through the puzzle landscape toward the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

I also need to be aware that the avatar's position does not change after any action I take.\n\nConsidering the current surroundings, the options are:\n\n- At (1, 1): \n  - Left (0, 1): Wall (`*`) - Not Allowed\n  - Right (1, 2): Floor (`_`) - Allowed\n  - Down (2, 1): Water (`e`) - Deadly, Not Allowed\n  - Up (0, 1): Wall (`*`) - Not Allowed\n\nThe only valid movement from the current position is to move **right** to (1, 2).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis move should allow the avatar to progress further along the path toward the goal while avoiding the walls and water.
