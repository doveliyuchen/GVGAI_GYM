    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a possible overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **strategic puzzle-adventure** or possibly a **stealth-action** game. It involves a player-controlled avatar navigating a grid-like space while interacting with various NPCs (Non-Player Characters) and points of interest.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features several sprites (characters and objects) including walls, a human player character (avatar), and various NPCs with different behaviors and attributes.\n  \n- **Movement**: The movements are grid-based as can be inferred from the level layout, with the player navigating through an environment composed of walls and open spaces.\n\n- **Interactions**: Players can interact with NPCs and objects in specific ways:\n  - If the avatar (player) interacts with George, a chaser NPC, it kills George and decreases the score.\n  - Interacting with the \"cigarette\" changes the annoyed NPC back to a quiet state and increases the score.\n  - The \"human\" sprite can only step back when interacting with walls.\n\n- **Sprite Properties**: Characters have speed, image assets, and other properties which influence gameplay dynamics. For example, George has a slower speed, indicating a potential challenge in evading or outmaneuvering him.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game appears to be:\n- Manipulating NPC states to achieve a specific score before a timeout occurs (1000 time units), which suggests an emphasis on strategic decision-making and resource management (specifically with the annoyed and quiet states).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**: The game seems to end successfully if the player maintains or achieves a certain state with the sprites (e.g., maintaining a quiet state) before the timeout.\n- **Loss Conditions**: Losing occurs if either the avatar sprite or the quiet NPC count drops to zero, indicating a failure to achieve the necessary state/conditions outlined for winning.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigate the Level Strategically**: Use the walls and the layout to create a buffer between your avatar and the chasing character (George). This allows time to think through your interactions.\n\n2. **Manage Interactions**: Focus on interacting with the \"cigarette\" to turn the \"annoyed\" NPC into \"quiet,\" as it increases your score. Set up scenarios where you can chain these interactions efficiently.\n\n3. **Avoid Conflicts with George**: Since George is a chaser and can be killed at a score cost, it's advised to avoid direct encounters unless absolutely necessary.\n\n4. **Watch for Timer and Sprite Counters**: Keep an eye on the timer and how many of each sprite you're managing. Ensure you interact with the necessary characters (like the \"quiet\" and \"annoyed\") to maintain your sprite count.\n\n5. **Plan Your Actions**: Since you have a limited amount of time, plan out your moves in advance. Prioritize certain actions based on urgency (like converting \"annoyed\" back to \"quiet\") before focusing on score-related actions.\n\nBy following these strategies, a player can optimize their gameplay to achieve the highest score while avoiding failure conditions, all within the constraints of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->
