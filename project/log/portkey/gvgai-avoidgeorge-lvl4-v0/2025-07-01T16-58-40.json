Players must navigate a maze-like environment, interact with various NPCs (non-player characters), and avoid negative interactions to maximize their score.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n- **Sprites:**\n  - There are various sprites including the player avatar (girl), annoying NPCs, quiet NPCs, a chaser NPC (George), and immovable walls.\n  - The avatar can interact with other sprites, transforming or affecting their states.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - The player can perform specific actions to change the state of NPCs or get involved with the environment (e.g., transforming George into an annoyed state, killing George to change the score).\n  - Interactions are limited by the types of sprites, with some having unique consequences (e.g., the cigarette can transform annoyed NPCs back into quiet ones).\n\n- **Terrain:**\n  - The game world consists of an enclosed area demarcated by walls with areas for different NPCs to inhabit and obstacles (walls) that can impede player movement.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe main objective seems to involve managing NPC states while avoiding losing conditions (like running out of avatars or having too many quiet NPCs). The player likely needs to strategically manipulate the environment and NPC behaviors to achieve success.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Time runs out (1000 units) resets the game or achieves a state of balance; likely needing to manage NPCs so that they are in a favorable state before the timer runs out.\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - Losing all avatar sprites results in a game over.\n  - If too many quiet sprites are present, it also indicates a loss.\n  \n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Keep track of the number of avatars you have. Loss leads to defeat.\n   - Manage the quiet NPCs to prevent reaching loss conditions.\n\n2. **NPC Interaction:**\n   - Use the avatar to directly interact with George to prevent him from becoming a threat, utilizing kills effectively.\n   - Strategically transform annoyed NPCs back to quiet to improve your chances of winning.\n\n3. **Movement Planning:**\n   - Navigate carefully to avoid collisions with walls and other sprites. \n   - Position the avatar effectively to make interactions more viable without triggering unwanted behaviors.\n\n4. **Timed Play:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer and strategize to maximize NPC management while racing against the clock. Transition smoothly between offensive (killing George) and defensive (transforming NPCs) actions.\n\n5. **Continuous Adaptation:**\n   - Be prepared to adapt your strategies as the game evolves. If situations change rapidly, be quick on your feet to modify how you interact with NPCs.\n\nBy employing a careful balance of offense (targeting George) and defense (managing quiet NPCs), players can maximize their score while keeping the risk of defeat at bay.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->
