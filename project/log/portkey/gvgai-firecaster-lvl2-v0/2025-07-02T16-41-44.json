The mechanics involve navigating a level, interacting with various objects, and solving challenges to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features different sprites with specific roles:\n  - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can collect resources and is affected by environmental hazards (fire, walls, etc.).\n  - **Goal**: A green door that signifies the completion of a level.\n  - **Mana**: A resource that can be collected to allow shooting.\n  - **Fire and Fire Ash**: Environmental obstacles that cause damage and can spread.\n  - **Walls and Boxes**: Obstacles that the avatar interacts with, affecting movement and gameplay.\n  - **Bullets**: Projectiles fired by the avatar, affecting other sprites (fire and boxes) in the environment.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can collect mana and shoot bullets.\n  - The fire can damage the avatar and spread to other sprites.\n  - Boxes can be transformed into fire when hit by bullets.\n  - Certain interactions cause both sprites (e.g., fire and fireAsh) to be destroyed.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to reach the **goal sprite** (the green door) while managing resources (mana) and avoiding hazards (fire and fireash). Players must navigate through the level using the avatar to collect mana and avoid or manipulate obstacles effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite (limit of goal sprites is 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches 0 (indicating the avatar has been eliminated).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Collect mana whenever possible but be wary of closely positioned hazards. Use bullets strategically to transform boxes into fire, creating opportunities or clearing paths.\n\n2. **Path Planning**: Carefully plan your moves to avoid running into fire or fireash. Remember that walls can block pathways and cause the avatar to step back when interacted with.\n\n3. **Utilize Fire**: Fire can serve a dual purpose: it can be harmful but also a tool to potentially clear your path by transforming other sprites into fire. Consider creating controlled fires on boxes to eliminate multiple obstacles at once.\n\n4. **Avoid Accumulating Damage**: With a limited health pool (3 health points), maintain distance from fire and focus on positioning to dodge hazards rather than taking hits.\n\n5. **Level Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Knowing where boxes and obstacles are located will help you navigate more efficiently and foresee potential risks or resources.\n\n6. **Experimentation**: If stuck, experiment with different interactions (firing bullets, using collected mana) to find alternative solutions to clear paths or reach the goal.\n\nImplementing these strategies will increase your chances of successfully navigating the level and reaching the goal while minimizing health loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nmana -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nspark -> '*'\nbullet -> 'b'\nfireAsh -> 'f'\nbullet fireAsh -> 'g'\nfire fireAsh -> 'm'\nbox spark -> 's'\nfire fireAsh spark -> 'w'\nfire spark -> 'c'\nbullet mana -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> @\nrow=2, col=17 -> @\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> @\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> @\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> %\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> %\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> %\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> @\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> @\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> #\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> %\nrow=9, col=10 -> a\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

    "content": "To assess the current state, the avatar 'a' is positioned at (9, 10) on the map. The goal '#' is located at (9, 1), and there are boxes '@' positioned nearby, as well as resource mana '$' helpful for shooting. \n\nThe strategy involves reaching the goal while managing resources and avoiding hazards. Since my current position is far from the goal and also close to various potential resources (like mana), my next move should progress towards reaching the goal or managing resources efficiently.\n\nConsidering the available actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (to (9, 9))**: This would move me one block closer to the goal, but there\u2019s a wall there, so I must avoid that direction.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (to (9, 11))**: This moves to an empty space, which is safe but also moves me away from the goal.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (to (10, 10))**: This will move into an area filled with walls, which is not useful.\n4. **ACTION_UP (to (8, 10))**: This remains empty and also moves me away from the target goal.\n\nGiven that moving left is blocked, I need to plan my next moves while considering jumping to maximize whichever direction eventually helps me traverse towards the goal with the least hindrances.\n\nAs I can't change my position by rotating without being able to go to either side productively, I think I should evaluate it broadly before proceeding.\n\nHowever, since the avatar should interact and resources seem crucial on the next move, I will decide to move to the nearest box hoping to fire mana towards one of those boxes. \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nFeedback: By moving down, I will reach row 10 from which I can assess options and look to maximize gathering resources in the next step towards the goal, while considering these mechanisms.",
