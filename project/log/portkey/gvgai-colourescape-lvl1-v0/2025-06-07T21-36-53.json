It combines elements of spatial navigation and logic-based problem solving, where players must manipulate boxes and switches to reach an exit while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Movement and Interaction**: \n   - The player controls an avatar, which can interact with various blocks (boxes) and switches to solve puzzles. \n   - Different box types (green, red, blue, etc.) affect the avatar's movement in distinct ways (bounce forward or undo previous actions).\n   - The avatar can also transform into different colored versions depending on the switch activated.\n\n2. **Obstacles and Hazards**: \n   - The environment includes immovable walls, pits (holes), and an exit door. Falling into a hole results in losing a point, while reaching the exit earns a point.\n   \n3. **Goal**: \n   - The primary objective is to maneuver the avatar through the level to reach the exit while managing the interactions with the boxes and switches effectively. The gameplay requires logical thinking and strategic planning.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by guiding the avatar to the exit, which increases the score by one.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player loses if the avatar falls into a hole (gaining a score decrease).\n  - If the avatar is lost or the game runs out of time, the player also loses.\n  - If there are no remaining avatars (SpriteCounter limit is 0), the player loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Your Tools**: Familiarize yourself with how each box type interacts with the avatars. Use bounce effects wisely to traverse obstacles.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Switch Use**: Strategically switching between avatars can provide different advantages; understand the benefits of each color before proceeding. \n\n3. **Manage the Environment**: Always be aware of the holes and walls as they can eliminate your avatars or restrict movement. Avoiding the holes is crucial, maintain a count of how many avatars you have left.\n\n4. **Plan Your Moves**: Look at each section of the level and predict how moving each box will affect the rest of the layout. Think a few steps ahead to avoid undoing your previous actions.\n\n5. **Time Management**: As there is a timeout condition, be mindful of pacing and don't hesitate. When in doubt, prefer rapid exploration and experimentation with box pathways and switches, while always keeping an eye on the timer.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and mastering the mechanics, players can solve puzzles efficiently and reach the exit without running out of avatars or time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'w'\nblueAvatar -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> g\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> r\nrow=3, col=2 -> r\nrow=3, col=3 -> r\nrow=3, col=4 -> r\nrow=3, col=5 -> r\nrow=3, col=6 -> r\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> r\nrow=4, col=12 -> r\nrow=4, col=13 -> r\nrow=4, col=14 -> r\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> r\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> f\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> r\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> r\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> r\nrow=7, col=15 -> r\nrow=7, col=16 -> r\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> r\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, we can see that the avatar, represented as 'f', is located at row 6, column 9. The surrounding environment indicates various hazards, obstacles, and boxes that may be interactable. There are green switches ('&') at (7,1), normal switches ('g') at (1,3), holes represented by 'h', which can result in a score loss, and exit ('%') at (2,16). \n\nThe current objective is to navigate towards the exit while managing boxes and avoiding hazards. Since the position of the avatar hasn't changed, we should perform a directional action that can potentially explore or manipulate the current environment.\n\nConsidering the layout around the avatar:\n- To the left (row 6, col 8) is a box ('$').\n- To the right (row 6, col 10) is also a box ('$').\n- Moving up (row 5, col 9) is a normal floor ('.').\n- Down (row 7, col 9) is a wall ('r').\n\nWe can move up to explore potential strategies with the boxes or aim to progress towards the exit by maneuvering around hazards.\n\nSince the preferred direction is to search for the exit and there are boxes blocking immediate paths, I will move upwards.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI'm choosing to move up as I want to explore the upper section for more options to reach the exit, and this aligns with my strategy of evaluating the surrounding area.",
