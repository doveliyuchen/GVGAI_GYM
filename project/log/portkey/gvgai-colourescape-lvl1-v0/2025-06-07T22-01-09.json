    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the given game rules and level layout, the game appears to be a **puzzle platformer** where players control an avatar and navigate through a level filled with various sprites, including walls, exits, holes (which cause death), boxes, switches, and other obstacles.\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Genre**: Puzzle Platformer\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Player Controls**: The player controls an \"avatar\" which can move around the level.\n- **Sprites**: Various types of sprites affect interactions, such as:\n  - **Boxes**: Can \"bounce\" the avatar or execute other interactions. Different types of boxes may behave differently depending on the avatar color.\n  - **Switches**: Changing the avatar's type based on which switches the avatar interacts with (normal, red, blue, green).\n  - **Exit**: Reaching the \"exit\" sprite allows the player to win.\n  - **Holes**: If the avatar falls into a hole, it results in a score penalty and presumably a loss of progress.\n  \n### Objective\n- **Primary Objective**: The main goal of the game is to navigate through the level and reach the exit without falling into holes or running out of avatars.\n  \n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the exit before they run out of avatars or time. \n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The player loses if they run out of avatars (counter reaches zero).\n  - The player loses if they time out (1500 time limit).\n  - Falling into a hole results in a penalty but may not directly lead to a game over unless there are no avatars left.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Take your time to assess the layout and determine which boxes and switches to interact with before moving.\n2. **Conserve Avatars**: Since there is a limit on the number of avatars you can use, avoid unnecessary risks, especially near holes.\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Utilize the boxes strategically. Understanding how different box types behave with the avatar's color can help you navigate complexities or reach platforms.\n4. **Switch Interactions**: Pay attention to the switches and switch colors to navigate through the level by transforming your avatar to best suit the obstacles ahead.\n5. **Prioritize Exits**: Always look for paths that lead to the exit, especially as time runs low. Avoid sidetracks that may complicate your route to the exit if you're running out of time.\n6. **Handle Threats Carefully**: Be mindful of holes; avoid jumping into them and plan a safe route that bypasses hazards when possible.\n\n### Overall\nThe game encourages logical thinking and planning as players have to manage their transformations, solve box-related puzzles, and move through a layout designed with both strategic paths and threats like holes. Maximizing the efficient use of the available avatars while navigating toward the exit is key to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'w'\nblueAvatar -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> g\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> r\nrow=3, col=2 -> r\nrow=3, col=3 -> r\nrow=3, col=4 -> r\nrow=3, col=5 -> r\nrow=3, col=6 -> r\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> r\nrow=4, col=12 -> r\nrow=4, col=13 -> r\nrow=4, col=14 -> r\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> r\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> r\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> r\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> r\nrow=7, col=15 -> r\nrow=7, col=16 -> r\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> r\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> f\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",

    "content": "To begin determining the best action for the avatar, I first need to analyze the current state of the map juxtaposed with the rules and strategies outlined in the game.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The avatar (denoted by 'a') is currently not mentioned directly in the state but is implied to exist. Prudent movements are heavily dependent on its current position.\n- The goal is to navigate to the exit (denoted by '%') without falling into holes (denoted by 'b').\n- There are various switches (like '@' and '&'), boxes that may interact differently with the avatar's color, and walls surrounding the play area.\n- The exit is at `(row=2, col=16)`\u2014this is the target destination and should be a priority in planning moves. \n\n### Previous Actions:\nWhile the previous action or avatar position is not explicitly stated, the general strategy highlights a need to plan movement towards the exit strategically and avoid falling into holes.\n\n### Goal:\nGiven the general layout and the focus on reaching the exit efficiently while managing the inherent risks (holes), I should focus on moving the avatar towards the exit position.\n\n### Suggested Move:\n- **Determine Direction**: The final destination is towards the right side of the map where the exit is located. Therefore, moving in the right direction will bring me closer to that target.\n\nSince it has not been indicated that the avatar's position has changed after any action taken, and moving primarily towards the right and ensuring no rotations are needed, I will move:\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\n\n### Feedback on the Action:\nBy moving right, I expect to get closer to the exit while assessing the next steps based on interactions with boxes and switches if they appear on this trajectory. This aligns well with the strategy of prioritizing exits effectively.",
