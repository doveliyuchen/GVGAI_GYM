It requires players to navigate through a level filled with various obstacles, switches, and portals while solving puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Obstacles**\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Walls, floors, exits, and holes that players cannot pass through or move.\n   - **Interaction Sprites**: Boxes that can bounce the avatar or undo movements depending on the box and avatar colors.\n   - **Transforming Switches**: The avatar can switch between different forms (normal, red, blue, green) which likely grant different abilities or interactions.\n   \n2. **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can move around the level but encounters constraints (stepping back on walls and being killed by holes).\n3. **Score System**: Players can gain or lose points based on interactions, e.g., entering the exit increases the score, while falling into a hole decreases it.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the **exit** and escape the level while avoiding pitfalls (holes) and utilizing switches and boxes effectively to navigate obstacles. The player must adjust their avatar based on the colored switches encountered to enhance interactions with other elements in the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Collecting the required number of exits will count as a win. The goal is to reach the exit sprite with a valid avatar.\n- **Loss Conditions**: Running out of avatar sprites leads to a loss, as does the timeout condition where time runs out before reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**:\n   - Observe the surroundings and identify where switches and boxes are located. Look for strategic paths and any connections between sprites.\n  \n2. **Utilize Switches**:\n   - Change your avatar's type based on the switches present in the level. Different avatar types interact differently with the environment, so choose wisely depending on the encountered boxes and obstacles.\n\n3. **Manage Boxes and Interactions**:\n   - Use the boxes to bounce forward or to reset any unfavorable positions without losing progress. Be aware of how different colored boxes affect avatar movement and other boxes in the game.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Keep an eye on holes that result in penalties. Always plan the next move to avoid falling into these traps.\n\n5. **Keep Track of Time**:\n   - With a timeout of 1500, manage your pace. Don\u2019t rush unnecessarily but ensure you move efficiently toward the exit.\n\n6. **Strategize Movement**:\n   - Focus on the movement patterns that allow you to avoid redundancy and ineffective movements. Use bouncing mechanics to your advantage to maneuver around walls and towards switches.\n\nIn conclusion, careful observation, strategic use of avatar transformations, and effective navigation through the level using the puzzle mechanics will be vital for success in this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> g\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> r\nrow=3, col=2 -> r\nrow=3, col=3 -> r\nrow=3, col=4 -> r\nrow=3, col=5 -> r\nrow=3, col=6 -> r\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> r\nrow=4, col=12 -> r\nrow=4, col=13 -> r\nrow=4, col=14 -> r\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> r\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> e\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> r\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> r\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> r\nrow=7, col=15 -> r\nrow=7, col=16 -> r\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> r\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
