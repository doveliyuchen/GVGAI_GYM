Players control an avatar while navigating through obstacles, switches, and boxes to reach an exit, with an emphasis on solving puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprite types include immovable elements (like walls, floors, holes), movable avatars, and switches that transform the avatar's identity/color.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Certain interactions have specific effects based on the combination of sprites involved (e.g., bouncing forward or undoing previous actions).\n   - The avatar can transform into different colored avatars upon interacting with corresponding switches, which may affect gameplay and interactions.\n3. **Movement and Actions**:\n   - The avatar moves through the environment, and player choices impact the state of the game.\n   - Avoiding holes (which result in loss of score) and successfully navigating to the exit are crucial.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the exit (indicated by the green door): \n- Successfully transform and interact with elements to navigate through the level.\n- Collect points and avoid losing score by falling into holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins by reaching the exit sprite with the avatar before running out of time or losing all lives (if any life system is implied).\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar ends up in a hole (which decreases the score) or if the avatar count drops to zero before reaching the exit. A timeout also results in a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before moving, look for possible pathways and the arrangement of obstacles. Note where switches are located and how they can assist with your avatar\u2019s transformation.\n2. **Use the Environment**: Leverage boxes and greens switches effectively to navigate through obstacles. Understand how different colored boxes interact with different avatars.\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Carefully plan movements to avoid holes that will result in a score penalty and possibly risk losing the avatar.\n4. **Toggle Switches**: Utilize switches to change your avatar\u2019s state wisely. Different avatar states may provide distinct advantages or characteristics useful in specific areas of the map.\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit and work efficiently toward the exit without unnecessary delays.\n\nBy combining an understanding of the mechanics with a well-planned strategy, players can increase their chances of reaching the exit successfully. Use the environment, make strategic transformations, and avoid hazards to navigate through each level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'w'\nblueAvatar -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> g\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> r\nrow=3, col=2 -> r\nrow=3, col=3 -> r\nrow=3, col=4 -> r\nrow=3, col=5 -> r\nrow=3, col=6 -> r\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> r\nrow=4, col=12 -> r\nrow=4, col=13 -> r\nrow=4, col=14 -> r\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> r\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> r\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> r\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> r\nrow=7, col=15 -> r\nrow=7, col=16 -> r\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> r\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",

The avatar can interact with the blue switch positioned above it `(4, 4)` to potentially change its state.\n2. The avatar is surrounded by boxes to the left and right but currently has an option to move either upward to a switch or downward into an empty space.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n- Moving up to the blue switch could be beneficial since toggling it while being a blue avatar might introduce additional interactions for progression and potentially clear the route towards the exit.\n- If I choose to move down, that leads to the empty space which does not seem advantageous at this time.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best course of action is to interact with the blue switch above to see if it alters the state of my avatar or opens up further pathways. \n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up to the blue switch allows me to potentially change my current state or interact with more elements in the game environment, aligning with the strategy of leveraging the environment for progression.",
