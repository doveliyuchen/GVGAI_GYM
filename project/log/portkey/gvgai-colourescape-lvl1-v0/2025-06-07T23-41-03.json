    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules and level layout provided, here's a comprehensive analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players navigate a two-dimensional space, solving puzzles using movement and interaction with various objects to reach an exit.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent various game objects (e.g., walls, boxes, switches, avatars, and holes). \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - **Movement**: The avatar can move and interact with various objects.\n   - **Transformations**: The avatar can change color/type by stepping on different switches, which likely leads to unique interactions with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes**: Certain boxes (green, red, blue) have properties that affect interactions, including bouncing or undoing actions.\n   - **Killing or Scoring**: Interaction with holes results in a penalty, while reaching the exit yields a score boost.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the **exit** while managing interactions with other sprites to avoid losing score and potentially running out of available avatars. Players need to solve puzzles crafted around the interactions of the various sprites (boxes, switches, and holes).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if they manage to reach the exit before the timer runs out and while still having available avatars.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if they either run out of avatars, remain trapped with no moves left, or the timer expires.\n\n### Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, you can consider following these strategies:\n\n1. **Plan Movements**: Before making a move, take note of the position of the boxes, switches, and holes. Each sprite has specific rules that determine what happens when the avatar interacts with it.\n   \n2. **Use Transformations Wisely**: When passing over color-coded switches, think ahead about how changing the avatar\u2019s type will impact your ability to interact with other sprites. Each avatar type has distinct interactions with the boxes.\n\n3. **Careful Box Manipulation**: Use boxes to bounce or perform actions strategically. They can alter the state of the game (gaining score or undoing certain conditions) but can also lead you into trouble if used improperly.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes**: Interacting with holes is detrimental to your score and can remove your avatar, affecting win conditions. Always check the layout for these dangers before moving.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer as you navigate and interact with the elements in the level. Make sure your moves are deliberate, minimizing unnecessary interactions that could lead to losing avatars or time.\n\n6. **Identify Safe Paths**: As you navigate, try to create a mental map of what constitutes a safe path to the exit without getting trapped or encountering holes prematurely.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind and utilizing careful planning, players can successfully navigate through the levels, making optimal use of their interactions with each sprite to reach the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'w'\nblueAvatar -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> g\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> r\nrow=3, col=2 -> r\nrow=3, col=3 -> r\nrow=3, col=4 -> r\nrow=3, col=5 -> r\nrow=3, col=6 -> r\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> r\nrow=4, col=12 -> r\nrow=4, col=13 -> r\nrow=4, col=14 -> r\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> f\nrow=5, col=6 -> r\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> r\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> r\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> r\nrow=7, col=15 -> r\nrow=7, col=16 -> r\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> r\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
