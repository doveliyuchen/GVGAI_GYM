It incorporates elements of spatial reasoning, object manipulation, and character transformation to navigate through levels.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites including:\n   - **Immovable objects** (walls, floor, holes),\n   - **Interactable objects** (boxes of different colors, switches),\n   - **Transformable avatars** (colored avatars with potentially varying abilities).\n   \n2. **Interactions**: The interaction mechanics are pivotal. Avatars can bounce off certain boxes or undo actions based on their color relationships. The switches allow for avatar transformation, suggesting color-based abilities might be a core feature of the game.\n\n3. **Movement and Collision**: The avatar can move and interacts with other sprites. There are consequences when the avatar collides with holes (losing points) and walls (stepping back).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to reach the exit. Players also need to avoid falling into holes, which results in a penalty, as well as manage the collection or interaction with boxes and switches.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**: The player wins by either (1) reaching the exit sprite while it exists or (2) ensuring that the exit sprite count does not reach zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The sprite count of avatars reaches zero,\n  - The time limit (1500) is reached before completing the objectives.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore Initial Moves**: Start by examining the immediate surroundings of the starting point. Identify which boxes and switches can be interacted with and understand their effects on the avatar's current color.\n\n2. **Managing Colors**: The game\u2019s logic heavily relies on the avatar\u2019s color. Pay attention to switches and the boxes that react differently based on the current avatar color. Switching to the right avatar type may be crucial for overcoming obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes and Manage Scores**: Make sure to navigate the terrain carefully to avoid dropping into holes, as this results in losing points and can eventually lead to a loss of the avatar.\n\n4. **Plan Your Route**: Given that there are boxes and walls, creating a mental plan or mapping out a path can help avoid unnecessary interactions that undo progress.\n\n5. **Efficient Use of Time**: Since there is a time limit, ensure that movements are deliberate and that unnecessary actions (such as repeated transformations) are minimized to optimize time usage.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Use trial and error on difficult sections, especially engaging with boxes and switches to see what transformations or movements will give the best outcome.\n\nIn summary, being strategic about the manipulation of colored boxes and switches while also maintaining an awareness of the time limit and hole hazards is crucial for successfully navigating through the levels and achieving the game\u2019s objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'w'\nblueAvatar -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> g\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> r\nrow=3, col=2 -> r\nrow=3, col=3 -> r\nrow=3, col=4 -> r\nrow=3, col=5 -> r\nrow=3, col=6 -> r\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> r\nrow=4, col=12 -> r\nrow=4, col=13 -> r\nrow=4, col=14 -> r\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> r\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> r\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> r\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> r\nrow=7, col=15 -> r\nrow=7, col=16 -> r\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> r\nrow=8, col=7 -> f\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",

    "content": "Given the current game state and map layout, the objectives are clear. Analyzing the position of the avatar ('a') is essential for determining the next move. Since the avatar is represented as 'f' (indicating a blue avatar) at (8, 7) with a blue switch '@' at (2, 2) nearby and various obstacles nearby, we have to consider our options carefully.\n\nTo proceed, I need to evaluate my position and the route to the exit ('%') at (2, 16). The primary concern is to navigate towards that exit while avoiding holes and managing my interactions effectively.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- The avatar is currently at (8, 7), just below a row filled with walls (8-0). The next column is also blocked by other objects.\n- The blue switch '@' could potentially grant a transformation or unlock some mechanics.\n- There are holes ('b') and walls ('r') specifically around rows 5, 6, and the subsequent rows.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) would lead me to (8, 6), which is clear.\n2. Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) would get me to (8, 8), which is a normal box ('n').\n3. Moving up (ACTION_UP) would attempt to bypass walls with limited effectiveness.\n4. Moving down (ACTION_DOWN) would lead me to the floor but not change my position towards an exit.\n\nGiven the constraint of walls and holes nearby, the best initial action for making progress toward the exit while avoiding traps or backwards movement will be moving **left**.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nBy moving left to (8, 6), I will explore an open area instead of getting trapped or in danger of falling into holes. I anticipate that this aligns with strategic thinking by providing more options for subsequent moves towards the exit.",
