The player navigates a terrain filled with obstacles and enemies while accomplishing specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar that can interact with various objects (like keys, enemies, and goals) and can attack using a sword.\n- **Goals:** The avatar must reach designated goals (small and large) while navigating through the level.\n- **Key Mechanic:** Collecting a key transforms the avatar, allowing interaction with certain goals (turning from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\").\n- **Enemy Interaction:** The player can defeat enemies to gain score, but getting hit by an enemy results in a score loss.\n- **Score System:** Points are awarded for defeating enemies, destroying vases, and achieving goals.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to progress through the level and achieve a high score by completing goals and defeating enemies. The player wins when they destroy all instances of the small and large goal sprites.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions:** \n  - Destroy all small goals.\n  - Destroy all large goals (with or without a key).\n- **Loss Condition:** \n  - The avatar is defeated by an enemy (score change loses points, but the loss of the avatar itself is the termination condition).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Objectives:** Focus on collecting keys and reaching goal sprites. The large goals yield substantially more points, so they should be prioritized whenever possible.\n2. **Manage Enemy Interactions:** Be aggressive with enemies to gain points, but be cautious; avoid getting hit, as losing points with each enemy hit can make subsequent interactions more challenging.\n3. **Utilize the Sword:** Use the sword strategically against enemies and vases. Vases provide score opportunities, and effectively dealing with enemies will increase your score and lessen the risk of losing.\n4. **Plan Pathways:** Observe the level layout, particularly where walls and monsters are located. Avoid engaging with multiple enemies at once to minimize damage taken and maximize score gained.\n5. **Key Strategy:** Always search for keys to transform your avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey.\" This upgrade significantly enhances interaction opportunities with larger goals.\n\nBy carefully managing interactions, focusing on objectives, and planning movement through the level, the player can efficiently navigate to victory while achieving a high score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> m\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To begin, let's analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map:\n\nYour avatar '@' (marked as 'm' in some contexts because it is currently holding the key) is situated at (10, 10). It can interact with the large goal '#' at (8, 11) and the small goal '&' at (10, 11). A sword '*' is not present in the surroundings as the avatar is already with key, suggesting that the avatar can interact with goals. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar at (10, 10) has access to the large goal ('#') at (8, 11) by moving up and the small goal ('&') at (10, 11) directly to the right.\n2. **Immediate Goals**: Both goals can be accessed in this move sequence. However, the small goal ('&') is directly adjacent to the avatar\u2019s current position (to the right).\n3. **Strategic Move**: If the goal is to maximize the score, it is typically advantageous to complete goals first, especially if they are within reach.\n\nGiven the available interactions and strategic considerations, the most immediate action is to move to the right (to access the small goal).\n\n### Intended Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action (moving right) to allow the avatar to collect points from the small goal immediately.",
