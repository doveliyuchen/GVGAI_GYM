    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules, this game appears to be a **2D action-adventure game** with elements of puzzle-solving and combat. The mechanics focus on movement, collecting items (keys), defeating enemies, and navigating through a maze-like environment.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various objects (sprites) with specific functions are present:\n  - **Player (avatar)**: The main character controlled by the player.\n  - **Goals (smallgoal, largegoal)**: These represent objectives to be completed for score points.\n  - **Key and Enemies**: The player interacts with keys to access goals and battles enemies to gain points.\n  - **Walls**: These are immovable obstacles in the game.\n\n- **Movement & Interactions**:\n  - The player can move but must avoid obstacles (walls) and other creatures or indirect hazards (enemies).\n  - The player collects keys to unlock goals. Having a key changes the interaction outcome at specific goals.\n  - Enemies can be defeated using a sword, leading to score changes.\n  \n#### Objectives\n- Collect **keys** to unlock **goals** (smallGoal and largeGoal).\n- Defeat **enemies** to earn points.\n- Maximize score by prioritizing larger goal interactions and defeating enemies.\n- Keys also transform the player's state between holding a key and not holding one.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The game is won if there is at least one sprite of **smallgoal** or **largegoal** present in the game.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The game is lost if the player (avatar) sprite is defeated (score reaches zero).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the map to familiarize yourself with the layout, noting the locations of walls, goals, enemies, and items (keys).\n  \n2. **Key Collection**: Focus on locating and acquiring keys quickly. This will allow access to the smallgoal and largegoal to maximize scoring potential.\n\n3. **Enemy Engagement**: Choose your battles wisely. Although defeating enemies grants points, encounters with higher cooldowns could be riskier. Use the sword effectively, ensuring you maintain health while defeating monsters for points.\n\n4. **Goal Prioritization**: The largegoal yields higher points; thus, it should be your priority after obtaining the key. If you reach a smallgoal first without a key, you should backtrack and find the key to maximize points.\n\n5. **Avoiding Death**: Stay alert to your surroundings to avoid enemy encounters that could lead to your avatar's defeat. If facing a strong enemy, retreating and avoiding unnecessary risks can prolong your gameplay.\n\n6. **Stay Tactical**: If a section of the level appears too congested with enemies, consider bypassing it or creating a strategy to clear a path after scouting and assessing.\n\nBy implementing this strategy and understanding the game mechanics and objectives, you can enhance your chances of winning and achieve a higher score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 's'\nsmallgoal sword -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the map, here's the analysis:\n\n1. Your avatar's position is at (10, 10), which corresponds to a sprite marked as 's' (with a key). \n2. The current possessions include a key (since 's' indicates that the avatar is holding a key).\n3. There is also a small goal ('b') located at (10, 11) that can be accessed immediately since your avatar is positioned next to it.\n4. The strategy suggests prioritizing goal interactions after acquiring keys. Therefore, visiting the small goal first is a meaningful action.\n\nI will execute the action to move right into the small goal:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is expected to allow interaction with the small goal for points while utilizing the key effectively, in alignment with the overall strategy.",
