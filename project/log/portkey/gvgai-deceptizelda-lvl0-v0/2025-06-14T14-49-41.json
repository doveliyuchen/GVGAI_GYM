    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here's an analysis of the game\u2019s structure, mechanics, objectives, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game can be classified as an **action-adventure puzzle game**. Players navigate a maze-like environment, solve challenges (like using keys), and engage in combat with enemies (monsters).\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Characters**:\n   - **Floor**: Basic tiles the player moves on; immovable.\n   - **Goals**: Two types of goals (small and large) that yield different scores when interacted with.\n   - **Keys**: Required to unlock certain doors and achieve goals.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character which can engage in combat and move throughout the maze.\n   - **Enemies**: Various types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that impede the player's progress.\n   - **Vases**: Interactive objects that can be destroyed for points.\n   - **Walls**: Serve as barriers that shape the maze layout.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player can engage enemies using a sword, collect keys, and interact with goals to achieve scores.\n   - Interactions change based on whether the player possesses a key or not, significantly affecting gameplay.\n\n3. **Avatar States**:\n   - The avatar can have two states: without a key (nokey) or with a key (withkey), which provides different interaction abilities.\n   - Flaming enemies may score negatively (loss of points) if they touch the avatar.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objectives are:\n- To collect enough **keys** to unlock and interact with small and large goals.\n- Achieve a total score high enough by accomplishing tasks like defeating enemies and destroying vases.\n- To achieve victory conditions based on interacting with all appropriate goals (both small and large) while ensuring the avatar's survival.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The game ends successfully if the player interacts with all small goals or all large goals.\n- **Loss**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed by an enemy.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Focus on exploring the level thoroughly to locate keys, vases, and enemy placements. Understanding the layout is crucial for planning your movements.\n  \n2. **Combat Management**: Avoid direct confrontations with enemies unless necessary. Use the sword thoughtfully and be aware of enemy types and their cooldowns.\n  \n3. **Key Collections**: Prioritize collecting keys to open larger goals that provide more points. Always take note of whether you are in the nokey or withkey state to plan your interactions effectively.\n  \n4. **Point Maximization**: Before interacting with goals, ensure you have taken the opportunity to defeat enemies and destroy vases to maximize your score.\n  \n5. **Avoiding Damage**: Steer clear of encounters with enemies as much as possible to maintain a positive score. Take advantage of the layout to avoid getting cornered.\n  \n6. **Goal Priority**: Focus on securing small goals first, as they might be easier to achieve quickly, and then strategize on dealing with larger goals.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate through challenges, avoid losses, and achieve their objectives within the game's framework.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nkey sword -> 'm'\nsword withkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current game state and the layout of the map, my position (avatar) is at (10, 10) with a sword and a key (indicated by `s`). There is a small goal immediately to the right at (10, 11) (indicated by `&`). \n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n- **Using the sword** (`ACTION_USE`) has no immediate benefit since there is no enemy in close proximity.\n- **Moving left** (`ACTION_LEFT`) leads to position (10, 9), which is empty (`.`), but it would not progress towards scoring.\n- **Moving right** (`ACTION_RIGHT`) to (10, 11) would result in interacting with the small goal (`&`), which is the best immediate action since it will contribute to my score and help meet win conditions.\n- **Moving down/up** would also either lead to walls or remain on empty tiles.\n\nConsidering the immediate advantage of achieving a goal, I will:\n\n```Action:3```\n\nThis action should successfully interact with the small goal, maximizing points and progressing towards winning conditions and aligns perfectly with the strategy of securing smaller goals first.",
