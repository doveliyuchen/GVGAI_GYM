The use of various sprites suggests that interactions and transitions are integral to gameplay.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movements**: \n   - The game features different types of sprites, including \"avatar\" (the player), \"george\" (an enemy that chases the player), \"quiet\" and \"annoyed\" (NPCs), and other environmental elements such as walls and a floor.\n   - The player can interact with these objects, leading to transformations and state changes.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player (avatar) can interact with \"george\" to eliminate him (-1 score) and with \"annoyed\" sprites to turn them into \"quiet\" sprites (+1 score).\n   - The transformation mechanics seem pivotal in managing NPC states and possibly controlling the game environment.\n\n3. **Environmental Constraints**:\n   - The walls are immovable, serving as barriers the player (and other sprites) cannot pass.\n   - The \"human\" sprite only interacts with walls to step back, which might imply a placeholder or character not actively involved in immediate gameplay.\n\n### Objectives\nThe main objectives include:\n- Manage the interactions with the various NPCs effectively.\n- Eliminate \"george\" to prevent him from interfering while trying to enhance the state of other NPCs (transforming them from \"annoyed\" to \"quiet\").\n- Avoid running out of time, as indicated by the timeout condition.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The player wins if the timeout limit (1000) is reached without the conditions causing the player to lose (such as having no \"avatar\" sprites or no \"quiet\" sprites).\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - If the \"avatar\" sprite counter equals zero or if the \"quiet\" sprite counter equals zero before the timeout, the player loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Safety**: Since \"george\" can chase and is a threat to the avatar, maintain distance and plan movements to avoid direct encounters.\n  \n2. **Transforming NPCs**:\n   - Focus on turning \"annoyed\" sprites into \"quiet\" ones to build up your score. Utilize the transformation mechanics effectively by first converting \"george\" into \"annoyed\" then into \"quiet\".\n  \n3. **Navigation**:\n   - Use the walls strategically to navigate safely through the level while leveraging the layout to escape or manipulate \"george\" and other sprites.\n  \n4. **Time Management**:\n   - Keep an eye on the timer. If not threatened by \"george\", take calculated actions to score points without unnecessarily rushing.\n\n5. **Plan Interactions Carefully**: Assess which actions yield the best outcome (such as killing \"george\" for score loss versus transforming NPCs for score gain).\n\nThis combination of observation, strategic interaction, and efficient movement can increase the likelihood of achieving a favorable outcome in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar ('a') is located at row 8, column 2, and its surroundings include a \"quiet\" sprite ('#') above it at row 8, column 3, and multiple \"annoyed\" sprites ('*') located in various positions. There are also numerous walls ('$') present in the environment. \n\nConsidering the strategy previously outlined, the immediate objective should be to increase the score by interacting with the \"annoyed\" sprites and maintaining a safe distance from \"george\" and any potential threats. Since the avatar is situated near a \"quiet\" sprite and has room to navigate, a logical action to take would be to move **up** to row 7, column 2 or manipulate an \"annoyed\" sprite nearby.\n\nHowever, it occurs to me that if I attempt to take any action and the avatar's position does not change, I may need to execute a secondary action. To maximize potential score and avoid conflict with \"george\" as much as possible, I will first try to move **up** into row 7, column 2, as this could potentially lead to a transformation of either a sprite or a positional advantage.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nMoving up to row 7, column 2 should allow me to evaluate the situation better and prepare for subsequent interactions. I expect this action will align with the strategic approach of managing NPC states (transforming any \"annoyed\" sprites) while remaining cautious of any enemies present.",
