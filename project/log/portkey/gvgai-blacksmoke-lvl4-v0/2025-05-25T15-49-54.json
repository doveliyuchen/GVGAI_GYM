    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fit into the **puzzle-platformer** genre, where the player navigates through a series of platforms and obstacles while solving puzzles to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - The player (referred to as \"avatar\") can interact with various objects, such as walls, ground, boxes, locks, keys, and a \"death\" sprite.\n   - The avatar uses a \"shovel\" (likely a tool for interaction) to break or manipulate objects like boxes, and can only possess one key at a time.\n   - Smoke clouds serve as a shield against the \"death\" sprite, suggesting a mechanic of dodging or tactical placement.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: \n   - The key is a critical item that the avatar must collect and use wisely since there is a limit of one key. If the avatar engages with a lock that requires a key but the avatar does not hold one (or if another condition of resource limitation applies), it can lead to defeat.\n  \n3. **Objectives**:\n   - The primary objective appears to be reaching the \"exit\" sprite, which grants a point but also leads to game termination.\n   - Clearing obstacles (like boxes) can grant scores, hinting that points may also be a secondary objective.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The game is won if the exit sprite is reached (SpriteCounter stype=exit win=True).\n- The player loses if the avatar sprite is defeated or if any condition related to the avatar\u2019s life status is triggered (SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False).\n\n### Overall Strategy\nTo successfully navigate through the game, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Understanding Movement**: \n   - Use the shovel effectively to clear boxes, which may reveal pathways or provide additional points. Be cautious of how you position the avatar when using the shovel to avoid getting stuck.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - Prioritize collecting the key as soon as possible, since only one is allowed. Avoid situations where you may have to interact with a lock without the key present, as that can lead to immediate defeat.\n  \n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - Utilize the smoke clouds strategically for protection against the death sprite. Position yourself in such a way that you can shield yourself when trying to navigate tricky areas.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Thoroughly explore each level to locate the key and determine the best pathway to the exit. Keep an eye on the layout to avoid dead ends or looping back into enemies.\n\n5. **Planning Moves**:\n   - Always plan your moves in advance. Determine what to interact with (either to advance or defend) before making a move, as the pixel environment can make it easy to misstep or trigger death unintentionally.\n\n6. **Scoring**:\n   - While the main goal is to reach the exit, also aim to break boxes and capitalize on the scoring mechanics to maximize points. This could provide bonus benefits or open up additional avenues for skill improvement if the game has further levels or challenges.\n\nBy combining these strategies with careful observation of the game environment and mechanics, players can effectively navigate the challenges posed by the game while aiming for the highest possible score and successful completion of levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox death
