This genre typically involves navigating a character through a level filled with obstacles and challenges, where players must solve puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites/Elements**: \n   - **Floor**: Acts as a solid ground; players can walk on it.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character (a rat) that can move around the level.\n   - **Box**: A movable object that interacts with the avatar and other elements.\n   - **Exit**: The goal of the level, indicated by a green door; reaching it scores points.\n   - **Hole**: A deadly element that can eliminate the avatar if interacted with.\n   - **Wall**: Barriers that cannot be passed through.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can step back when hitting a wall.\n   - The box bounces the avatar forward when they collide.\n   - Boxes can reset positions if they interact with certain elements (walls/exits).\n   - The avatar loses points if it falls into a hole but gains points by reaching the exit.\n   - Boxes are destroyed if they fall into holes.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends if the avatar is eliminated (score limit of 0).\n   - The game is won when all exits are reached (exit limit of 0).\n   - A timeout condition that results in a loss if not reached within a time limit (1000 units).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, avoid holes, manipulate boxes, and reach the exit to earn points while not running out of life (or the sprite limit) in order to win the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: Successfully reach the green exit door with the avatar, which allows for the game to continue (exit limit of 0).\n- **Loss**: Lose all avatar sprites (life) or fail to complete the level in the given time.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout, identifying the positions of exits, boxes, walls, holes, and where the avatar spawns.\n  \n2. **Avoid Holes**: Be cautious when navigating close to holes to prevent losing your avatar immediately.\n\n3. **Box Manipulation**: Use boxes strategically. They can help you navigate obstacles or reach the exit. Understand their bounce mechanics to propel the avatar effectively.\n\n4. **Plan Your Moves**: Given that walls can block your way, plan your movement order to avoid getting stuck or pushed back without making progress.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Move efficiently to avoid timeout, especially while solving puzzles or avoiding obstacles.\n\n6. **Experiment and Adapt**: If an approach fails (like trying to take a box to a specific location), don\u2019t hesitate to try different strategies or paths.\n\nBy leveraging the interactions between the avatar, boxes, walls, and exits, players can successfully navigate the challenges in the puzzle-platformer environment while striving to accumulate points and avoid pitfalls.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> a\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
