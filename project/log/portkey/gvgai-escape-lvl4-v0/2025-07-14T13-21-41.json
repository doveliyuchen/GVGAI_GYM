Game Type and Theme\n\u2003\u2022 This is a grid\u2010based puzzle game with block\u2011pushing elements (think along the lines of Sokoban) mixed with action elements.\n\u2003\u2022 The theme appears to involve guiding a little rat (the avatar) through a maze-like level filled with walls, boxes, holes, and an exit (depicted as cheese).\n\n2. Game Mechanics\n\u2003\u2022 Movement: You control an avatar that moves around a grid. It can\u2019t pass through walls (the avatar bumps into them and steps back).\n\u2003\u2022 Pushing Boxes: The avatar can interact with boxes. When the avatar bumps into a box, the box is pushed or \u201cbounces forward.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Obstacles and Hazards:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Walls: Impassable obstacles that restrict movement and box pushing.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Holes: Dangerous spots. If the avatar accidentally enters a hole, it is \u201ckilled\u201d (removed) and you get a score penalty; similarly, if a box goes into a hole, that box disappears.\n\u2003\u2022 Special Interactions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s an interaction rule involving a box, wall, exit, and another box that triggers an \u201cundoAll\u201d action. This appears to be a built\u2011in mechanism to reverse a set of moves, possibly to prevent unsolvable positions if boxes are pushed incorrectly.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When the avatar reaches the exit contact (touching the exit triggers an interaction), the exit is removed, giving you a score bonus. Removing the exit seems to be the key to completing the level.\n\u2003\u2022 Scoring: Moving into holes subtracts points (or even kills your avatar), while reaching the exit awards points.\n\u2003\u2022 Time Limit: There is a move or time limit (timeout after 1000 \u201cticks\u201d moves), so you must work quickly and efficiently to solve the puzzle.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2022 Objective: The primary goal is to guide the avatar to the exit. Touching the exit \u201ckills\u201d the exit sprite but that removal is treated as a win (as per the termination condition that checks for 0 exit sprites).\n\u2003\u2022 Losing: You lose if the avatar is removed (for example, by stepping into a hole) or if you run out of time (exceed 1000 moves).\n\u2003\u2022 Winning: The level is won if you manage to remove the exit by guiding the avatar into it before your avatar dies or you run out of moves.\n\n4. Overall Strategy\n\u2003\u2022 Analyze the Maze: Start by studying the map layout. Identify the positions of walls, boxes, holes, and the exit. This will help you figure out which routes are safe and which areas need to be cleared.\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Box Movements: Since boxes can be pushed, decide if moving a box will help create a clear path toward the exit. But be cautious\u2014if boxes are pushed poorly (especially near walls, exits, or other boxes), the \u201cundoAll\u201d rule may kick in and reverse your progress.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Hazards: Be extremely careful with the holes. Working out routes that steer clear of dangerous spots is crucial, as a single misstep could cost you the game.\n\u2003\u2022 Work Backwards: Sometimes it helps to think backward from the exit. Figure out where the avatar should be relative to the exit to trigger the winning interaction.\n\u2003\u2022 Use Caution with Undo Dynamics: Since an incorrect push might force an undo (via that curious box\u2013wall\u2013exit\u2013box combo), try to visualize how boxes will move in response to your actions so that you don\u2019t inadvertently undo your progress.\n\u2003\u2022 Time Management: Always keep an eye on the move count; deliberate, careful planning is preferred over hasty moves.\n\nIn summary, you control a rat navigating a maze where you must manage both your movement and the positions of boxes while avoiding deadly holes. Getting the avatar to the exit without running into hazards or wasting moves is the key. The puzzle element lies in predicting and controlling the interactions between moving boxes and static obstacles, so a thoughtful, measured approach is your best overall strategy.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> a\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> a\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
