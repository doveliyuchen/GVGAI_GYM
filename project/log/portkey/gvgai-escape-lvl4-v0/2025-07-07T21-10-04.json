    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle (likely Sokoban-style)\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The player (avatar) can push boxes.\n*   **Movement Restrictions:** The avatar cannot move through walls.\n*   **Holes as Hazards/Teleporters:** Holes are dangerous (avatar dies), but they could be teleporters if portal=True is working.\n*   **Limited Time:** The game has a timeout (1000 steps).\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Get the avatar to the exit (cheese).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** No exits remain (avatar reached the exit, exit disappears).\n*   **Loss:**\n    *   No avatars remain (avatar died).\n    *   Timeout (run out of moves).\n\n**Sprites:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player-controlled character (rat).\n*   **Box:** Pushable objects.\n*   **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **Exit:** The goal (cheese).\n*   **Hole:** A hazard that kills the avatar (or teleports it elsewhere).\n*   **Floor:** Background\n\n**Interactions:**\n\n*   **Avatar + Wall:** Avatar can't move through walls.\n*   **Box + Avatar:** Avatar pushes the box, avatar moves in direction of force.\n*   **Box + Wall/Exit/Box:** All sprites revert to their previous position before the interaction.\n*   **Avatar + Hole:** Avatar dies.\n*   **Exit + Avatar:** Avatar wins level.\n*   **Box + Hole:** Box disappears when pushed into a hole.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban games require careful planning. Think several steps ahead before making a move.\n2.  **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be extremely careful not to push boxes into corners or against walls in such a way that they can't be moved anymore. This is the most common way to lose.\n3.  **Hole Awareness:** Be very mindful of the holes. One wrong push can send the avatar into a hole, resulting in failure.\n4.  **Optimize Moves:** Since there's a move limit (timeout), try to find the most efficient way to solve the puzzle. Avoid unnecessary moves.\n5.  **Prioritize Exit Access:** Focus on clearing a path to the exit early.\n6.  **Box Management:** Use holes to remove boxes that are blocking the way, but only if it doesn't create a new blockage.\n\nIn short, this is a Sokoban-style puzzle game where you must strategically push boxes to reach the exit, avoiding hazards and deadlocks, within a limited number of moves. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> a\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
