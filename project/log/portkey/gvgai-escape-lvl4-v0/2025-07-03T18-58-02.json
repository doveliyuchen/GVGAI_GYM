You control an avatar (a rat) that must safely navigate through a level filled with walls, movable boxes, dangerous holes, and an exit (shown as a piece of cheese).\n\nGame Elements and How They Work:\n\u2022\u2003Avatar (the rat): Moves around the level. It can\u2019t pass through walls (if it bumps into one it steps back) so you must carefully plan your moves.\n\u2022\u2003Walls and the Floor: They form the structure of the maze. Walls block movement.\n\u2022\u2003Boxes: These are movable objects. They interact with the avatar (bouncing it forward when they meet) and they vanish if pushed into a hole. You might need to shift them around to clear pathways or even use them strategically around hazards.\n\u2022\u2003Holes: These are dangerous spots. If your avatar falls into a hole, it dies (and you lose a point). However, boxes that go into holes are simply removed. Thus, boxes might sometimes be sacrificed rather than your avatar.\n\u2022\u2003Exit (cheese): Touching the exit with your avatar triggers its removal (and gives you a point). The game is won when all exit pieces in the level have been cleared. In a sense, your goal is to \u201ccapture\u201d the exit safely by letting your avatar touch it.\n\nWin/Loss Conditions:\n\u2022\u2003Win: When you have removed (cleared) all the exit pieces from the level.\n\u2022\u2003Loss: If your avatar is removed (for example, by falling into a hole) or if you exhaust your moves (reaching the timeout limit of 1000).\n\nPossible Overall Strategy:\n1. Look Ahead: Since movement is restricted by walls and hazards like holes, think a few steps ahead so you make sure every move helps you get closer to the exit without ending up in a trap.\n2. Manage Your Boxes: Boxes are your tools for solving the puzzle. They might be used to block dangerous holes or to manipulate the environment. However, be cautious: pushing a box wrong might result in it being lost to a hole, so plan carefully.\n3. Avoid Hazards: The holes are deadly for your avatar. Use your boxes if possible to either block off or bypass holes, and always be ready for unexpected interactions\u2014the avatar might get bounced forward by a box.\n4. Recognize Undo Triggers: One of the interactions (involving box, wall, exit, and box) suggests there might be situations where moves \u201cundo\u201d themselves. This could be a safety mechanism for preventing illegal moves or unsolvable configurations. Keep that in mind as you experiment with moving boxes.\n5. Limited Moves: With a move limit (timeout at 1000), every step counts. Plan efficiently and avoid blind moves.\n\nIn summary, your challenge is to guide your avatar carefully through the maze, using boxes wisely to mitigate the hazards while advancing toward the exit. Think ahead, plan your route to avoid holes, and gradually work toward \u201cclearing\u201d the exit to win the level. Enjoy the brain-teasing combination of maze navigation and puzzle-solving!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> a\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
