The player controls an avatar that interacts with various elements in a 2D environment to achieve objectives involving navigation and manipulation of elements.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Movement and Interaction**: \n   - The avatar can move around the level.\n   - The avatar can bounce off walls and can push boxes.\n   - Boxes can interact with both the avatar and the walls in specific ways.\n   - The player can be affected by the presence of holes, which can kill the avatar if they fall into them.\n   \n2. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Serves as the ground and is immovable.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can move around and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box**: A passive object that the avatar can bounce off and manipulate.\n   - **Exit**: The target object that the player must navigate toward to complete the level.\n   - **Hole**: A dangerous area that kills the avatar if entered.\n   - **Wall**: Immoveable barriers that interact with the avatar and boxes.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar to reach the exit sprite while avoiding pitfalls (holes) and managing box interactions effectively. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win: Reach the exit sprite with the avatar.\n- Loss: If the avatar is killed by falling into a hole or if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero due to being killed.\n- Additionally, if there\u2019s a timeout (not specified how time affects gameplay), the game is also lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Avoid Holes**: Strategically maneuver the avatar to prevent it from falling into holes, as each fall leads to a score deduction and potential loss of the game.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes to create pathways or block access to holes. Bouncing off boxes can help clear paths that might otherwise lead to hazards.\n\n3. **Plan the Route**: Before moving, observe the layout of walls, holes, and the position of the exit. Plan the path to minimize backtracking and to avoid unnecessary interactions with walls which can push the avatar back.\n\n4. **Manage Movement**: Take your time to consider each movement. Rushing might lead to unintended consequences, such as falling into a hole or getting stuck in a loop of wall interactions.\n\n5. **Explore Thoroughly**: Since there are multiple routes indicated by \u201choles\u201d and walls, explore different paths to find the most optimal route to reach the exit.\n\n6. **Timing is Key**: Keep an eye on the timer. Certain strategies may take longer and need to be balanced against the risk of timeout.\n\nBy carefully assessing the level layout and mechanics, players can successfully navigate to the exit while avoiding pitfalls and manipulating boxes effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is located at (5, 10) and we need to navigate it to the exit located at (7, 1). \n\nThe immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n- Up (4, 10): A box '@'\n- Down (6, 10): A wall '%'\n- Left (5, 9): A floor '.'\n- Right (5, 11): A floor '.'\n\n### Analyzing the situation:\n1. **Immediate Moves**: The avatar cannot move down due to a wall; it can move left or right, or push the box above it.\n2. **Goal Location**: The exit is two rows down and nine columns to the left, which means we will need to make moves that help us navigate towards (7, 1).\n3. **Box Manipulation**: There's a box directly above the avatar. Pushing it upward may open up more path opportunities.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Since the avatar has several options but can\u2019t go down due to a wall, I will first push the box to create more maneuvering space.\n\nThus, the action will be to push the box up.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should result in moving the avatar in such a way that I can consider further movements afterward. The expectation is to see the box moved out of the way to explore more routes towards the exit.",
