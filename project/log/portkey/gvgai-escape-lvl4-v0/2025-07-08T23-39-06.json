When the avatar bumps into a box, the box \u201cbounces\u201d or gets pushed forward.  \n\u2003\u2013 Walls and floor tiles form the boundaries and obstacles. The walls force the avatar (or any moving object) to step back if collided with.  \n\u2003\u2013 There are special tiles:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Holes act as traps or portals\u2014a misstep by the avatar (stepping on a hole) kills it and costs you points, while if a box falls into a hole, the box is simply removed.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Exits (depicted as a piece of cheese) serve as the goal. When the avatar reaches an exit, the game removes that exit and rewards you with points.  \n\u2003\u2013 There is an \u201cundo\u201d mechanic tied to pushing boxes: if you try to push a box into a wall, an exit, or another box, the game reverses (undoes) the move. This keeps your actions from putting you in an unwinnable position.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:  \n\u2003\u2013 Your main goal is to remove all exit sprites from the level. The win condition is met once there are no more exit pieces left on the board.  \n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is \u201ckilled\u201d (for example, by accidentally moving into a hole) or if you exceed a set number of moves (the timeout limit of 1000).  \n\u2003\u2013 Score changes occur with some interactions (positive when reaching an exit and negative when falling into a hole), providing extra incentive to plan carefully.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:  \n\u2003\u2013 Plan your moves ahead. Because pushing boxes incorrectly (for instance, into walls, exits, or other boxes) will cancel your move, always be sure that the space beyond is free.  \n\u2003\u2013 Navigate the maze with caution: avoid holes that will instantly end your avatar\u2019s run.  \n\u2003\u2013 Use boxes strategically. You might need to reposition boxes or even sacrifice them (by sending them into holes) to clear your path toward the exits.  \n\u2003\u2013 Since the game undoes moves that lead to blocked boxes, think about how you want your boxes to \u201cbounce forward\u201d without ending up against impenetrable obstacles.  \n\u2003\u2013 Keep an eye on your move count. Aim to solve the puzzle efficiently to avoid hitting the timeout, which would cost you the game.\n\nBy carefully planning each step and ensuring that every box push is safe, you can navigate the maze, avoid deadly pitfalls, and clear away all exit sprites to win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> a\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
