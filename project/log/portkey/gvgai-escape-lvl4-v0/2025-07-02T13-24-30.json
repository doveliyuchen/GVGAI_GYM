Players must navigate through a level filled with obstacles and interact with objects to achieve a goal.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**: They represent various elements in the game such as the avatar (player character), boxes (movable/interactive objects), walls (barriers), exits (goals), holes (deadly traps), and a floor (ground).\n  \n2. **Movement**: The avatar is the only element capable of movement. It can interact with boxes and walls, leading to unique responses like bouncing back or being blocked.\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can move but is stopped by walls.\n   - When the avatar interacts with a box, it bounces forward instead of moving it.\n   - The exit gives a score upon reaching it, while falling into a hole costs points.\n   - Additionally, the game features a sprite counter, determining win/loss through the presence of exits and avatars.\n\n4. **Scoring**: Players gain points by successfully reaching the exit and lose points when they fall into holes. \n\n**Objective**:\nThe main objective is to guide the avatar through the level to reach the exit (represented by the green cheese) while avoiding holes, which leads to a score penalty. Players must also manage the movement of boxes strategically to clear pathways.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- The player wins the game when the avatar successfully reaches the exit.\n- The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (goes to zero) or if the time runs out (timeout of 1000).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before starting to move, observe the layout of the walls, boxes, holes, and the exit to formulate a step-by-step approach.\n\n2. **Box Manipulation**: Use boxes wisely to create platforms or to block holes temporarily. Since the interaction causes the avatar to bounce upon contact, ensure you understand how to use this to your advantage.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of the hole locations. Try to navigate through the level while avoiding these, as falling into one will decrease your score, which may prevent you from winning if you hit a critical threshold.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep track of time and attempt to complete the level without rushing too much, as moving too quickly might lead to mistakes.\n\n5. **Backtrack When Necessary**: If a move results in a negative outcome (e.g., moving the box to a bad position or falling into a hole), don\u2019t hesitate to backtrack and reassess your strategy.\n\nBy using these strategies and understanding the mechanics, players can successfully navigate the challenges presented in the levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> %\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
