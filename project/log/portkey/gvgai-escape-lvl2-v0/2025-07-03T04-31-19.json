You control a moving avatar (a rat, in this case) that must navigate a maze-like level filled with walls, boxes, holes, and an \u201cexit\u201d that looks like a piece of cheese. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Mechanics\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a puzzle/strategy game played on a grid. You move your avatar around a fixed layout.\n\u2003\u2013 The level is built of various sprite types. Walls and floors set the stage; boxes are obstacles that can interact with other objects, and holes are dangerous pits acting as portals.\n\u2003\u2013 When your avatar bumps into a wall, it gets pushed back so you can\u2019t go through solid barriers.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes, when interacting with the avatar or other objects, sometimes \u201cbounce\u201d or trigger special events.\n\u2003\u2013 Special composite interactions (like one involving a box, wall, exit, and another box that causes an \u201cundoAll\u201d) suggest that certain illegal or unsolvable configurations are automatically reversed.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Objective\n\u2003\u2013 Your goal is to clear the level by eliminating the exit sprites (the cheese). When the avatar reaches an exit, the exit is removed (and you get a point), and when no exits remain the level is won.\n\u2003\u2013 This means you have to intentionally go onto the exit to \u201ccapture\u201d it, rather than simply avoiding it.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is killed\u2014for example, if it falls into a hole, which is fatal and subtracts a point.\n\u2003\u2013 The game is also lost if you exceed the move/time limit (here set at 1000 steps).\n\u2003\u2013 The level is won when all the exit pieces are removed.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Overall Strategy\n\u2003\u2013 Plan your moves carefully in the labyrinth: the maze layout, walls, and boxes require thoughtful navigation.\n\u2003\u2013 Make sure to use your boxes strategically. They might be moved (or \u201cbounced\u201d) to block paths or correct potential deadlock situations, but be wary: if a box falls into a hole, it will be removed.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid holes like the plague: stepping on one takes out your character and points.\n\u2003\u2013 Figure out how to get to the exit safely. Since touching the exit \u201ckills\u201d the exit sprite and adds to your score, you want to guide your avatar to them at the right time.\n\u2003\u2013 If you run into a configuration that seems to trap you (for example, misplaced boxes blocking your way), the game\u2019s undo mechanic (triggered by a complex interaction) may help revert the situation.\n\u2003\nIn summary, the game challenges you to think ahead in a grid-based puzzle environment. Carefully navigate your avatar around obstacles and hazards, use the boxes wisely, and deliberately collect the exit (cheese) sprites to complete the level before time runs out. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> a\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
