    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nHere\u2019s a plain\u2010language breakdown of what\u2019s going on:\n\n\u2022 Genre & Type:\n\u2003This game falls into the puzzle/action family with a bit of \u201cpush\u2010block\u201d or Sokoban-like mechanics. You have to think several moves ahead while maneuvering around static obstacles and hazards.\n\n\u2022 Key Game Components:\n\u2003\u2013 The Avatar: You control a moving \u201cactor\u201d (a rat sprite) that must be guided through the level.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes: These are movable passive objects that interact with your avatar. They can get bumped (\u201cbounceForward\u201d) when you run into them.\n\u2003\u2013 Walls & Floor: Walls block your progress (your avatar \u201csteps back\u201d if you run into one) while the floor is just a background.\n\u2003\u2013 Exit: Represented by a door with a cheese image, these are your targets. Interacting with an exit in the proper way makes it disappear (\u201ckillSprite\u201d from the exit\u2013avatar interaction) and gives you a bonus point.\n\u2003\u2013 Holes: These dark blue hazards act like portals. If the avatar falls in a hole, it is killed and you lose a point. Boxes that run into holes disappear as well.\n\n\u2022 How It Works (Mechanics):\n\u2003\u2022 Movement and collisions are the core:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If your avatar bumps into a wall, it can\u2019t pass through \u2013 it gets pushed back.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When your avatar collides with a box, the box is pushed or \u201cbounced\u201d forward.\n\u2003\u2022 There\u2019s a unique twist with boxes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When a box hits a wall, an exit, or another box (the rule \u201cbox wall exit box > undoAll\u201d), the game \u201cundos\u201d all the moves from that turn. That probably means you must plan your pushes very carefully to avoid accidental collisions that cancel your progress.\n\u2003\u2022 The exit is both an object to interact with and your win condition:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Once you \u201cuse\u201d an exit (by having your avatar go to it), the exit sprite is removed (and you gain 1 point).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When all exit sprites are cleared (SpriteCounter limit=0 for exit), you win.\n\u2003\u2022 Losing happens if:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Your avatar is killed (for example, by falling into a hole; note that if you accidentally trigger the wrong collision, your only \u201clife\u201d may be lost).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 You run out of time (exceeding 1000 turns).\n\n\u2022 Overall Goal:\n\u2003Your aim is to clear all the exits from the level without killing your avatar. In doing so you\u2019ll collect points and eventually win the level.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\u20031. Plan Your Route: Since the avatar is one \u201clife,\u201d avoid risky moves. Look ahead so you don\u2019t accidentally wander into a hole or force a box into an obstacle.\n\u20032. Use Boxes Carefully: Pushing boxes is necessary but can be tricky because if they hit a wall, an exit, or another box, you\u2019ll undo your moves. Think before you push; sometimes it might be better to reposition your avatar first.\n\u20033. Clear Exits Systematically: Since exiting the level clears an exit and moves you toward victory, seek to interact with exits in a controlled way. Get in position to approach them without interference from boxes that could undo your progress.\n\u20034. Time Awareness: With a 1000\u2013turn limit, efficiency matters. Don\u2019t waste moves on unnecessary repositioning; each move counts.\n\u20035. Avoid Hazards: Holes are deadly for your avatar. Stay alert to your surroundings and plan moves to keep away from holes while still progressing toward your targets.\n\nIn short, the game is a careful balancing act of navigating around static obstacles, strategically pushing boxes without triggering an \u201cundo\u201d penalty, and collecting your way to victory by clearing all exit items\u2014all while keeping your avatar safe and working within a limited number of moves.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
