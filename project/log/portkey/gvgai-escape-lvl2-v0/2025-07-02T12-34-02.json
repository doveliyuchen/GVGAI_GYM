    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Game Genre\nThe game can be categorized as a **puzzle-platformer**, where players navigate a grid-like environment, solve puzzles involving moving boxes, and avoid hazards to reach an exit.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - **Floor**: The basis of the playable area.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can be moved and interacted with.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be moved and used to solve puzzles.\n   - **Exit**: Represents the goal of the level.\n   - **Hole**: A hazard that can destroy both the avatar and boxes.\n   - **Wall**: Impassable barriers that the avatar cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can step back when encountering a wall.\n   - The avatar bounces forward when colliding with a box.\n   - Moving boxes into certain positions (e.g., walls, exits) can cause different outcomes, including reverting the game state.\n   - The avatar loses a point if it interacts with a hole and gains a point upon reaching the exit.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The main objective is to navigate the avatar to the exit (green door) while managing the boxes to create pathways.\n- Players need to avoid hazards (holes) that can lead to a loss of points and can potentially lead to failing the level if certain conditions are met.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Reach the exit; this will remove the avatar and grant a score increase.\n  - Ensure that the exit sprite count reaches zero.\n\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar sprite count reaches zero (indicating death).\n  - The level times out (the timer hits the maximum without reaching the goal).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Moves**: Before moving the avatar, plan out each move carefully. Consider how moving boxes will affect the environment. \n   - Avoid unnecessary movements that could lead the avatar into holes.\n\n2. **Box Management**: Leverage boxes to create pathways. \n   - Use boxes strategically to block off holes which could be in the avatar's path, ensuring a safe route.\n\n3. **Exploration**: Explore the level cautiously. \n   - Identify the location of walls, gaps, and holes before attempting to reach the exit.\n\n4. **Minimize Risk**: Avoid bouncing the avatar too close to holes. \n   - Familiarize yourself with the interaction rules to avoid accidental deaths.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer; if the game is timed, pace your movements to ensure you can reach the exit within the limit.\n\n6. **Iterate & Adjust**: If a strategy doesn\u2019t work, be prepared to backtrack and try alternative methods of manipulating the boxes.\n\nBy utilizing these insights and strategies, players can effectively navigate through the game's levels, solve puzzles, and strive to reach the exit successfully while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> a\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

However, we need to be cautious of the hazardous holes and walls. \n\nSince the avatar's current position is near the bottom of the map, a feasible action would be to move in a direction that allows the avatar to explore the upper levels toward the exit, which requires moving up.\n\n### Recommended Action\nThe most strategic immediate action is to move **up** to (row 6, col 11):\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move should position the avatar safely above, while also enabling further movement options toward the exit in subsequent turns, maintaining focus on effective box management and exploration.",
