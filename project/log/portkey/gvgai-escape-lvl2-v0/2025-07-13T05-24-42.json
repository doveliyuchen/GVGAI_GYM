    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nHere\u2019s a plain\u2010language breakdown of the game:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Style:\n\u2003 This is a grid\u2010based, puzzle-style game with a bit of a \u201cSokoban\u201d flavor. You control an avatar (a rat) navigating a maze-like level filled with obstacles and hazards.\n\n\u2022 Key Game Elements:\n\u2003 \u2013 Avatar: The player\u2019s character, which moves step by step on a grid.\n\u2003 \u2013 Walls and Floor: The walls block your avatar\u2019s movement (any attempt to move into a wall makes you step back), while the floor is just the background.\n\u2003 \u2013 Boxes: Passive objects that interact with the avatar. If the avatar bumps into a box, the box \u201cbounces forward.\u201d They may also be involved in a more complex interaction (touching walls and exits) that triggers an \u201cundoAll\u201d \u2013 which likely resets recent changes.\n\u2003 \u2013 Holes: Hazardous tiles. If your avatar falls into a hole, it immediately dies (with a score penalty). Boxes also vanish if they go into a hole.\n\u2003 \u2013 Exit (Cheese/Door): The goal you need to reach. When your avatar touches the exit, the exit sprite is removed and you earn a score point. The win condition is set to trigger when there are no exit sprites left.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003 \u2013 Your aim is to safely guide your avatar to the exit. Since interacting with the exit \u201ckills\u201d the exit sprite (and a win is declared when there are no exits left), reaching it ends the level in victory.\n\u2003 \u2013 You lose if your avatar gets killed (for example, if it falls into a hole) or if you run out of moves (there\u2019s a timeout after 1000 steps).\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003 \u2013 Plan your route carefully: Navigate the maze by watching out for walls, dangerous holes, and the placement of boxes.\n\u2003 \u2013 Be cautious when interacting with moving elements: The \u201cbounceForward\u201d behavior when colliding with boxes might spin them into hazardous areas or undo valuable progress.\n\u2003 \u2013 Prioritize safety: Avoid holes at all costs, but be ready to use boxes if they can help clear a path or, conversely, if they might obstruct you inadvertently.\n\u2003 \u2013 Time management: Since you have a limited number of moves, each step should be deliberate\u2014aim to reach the exit efficiently without triggering unnecessary resets (thanks to the \u201cundoAll\u201d interactions).\n\u2003 \u2013 Watch out for cascading effects: Sometimes moving one element (like nudging a box into a wall or the exit) might undo other moves, so consider the chain reaction your moves might cause.\n\nIn summary, think of the game as a careful balancing act: a puzzle where every move has consequences. By planning your steps ahead, avoiding hazards, and managing the boxes wisely, you can safely guide your rat to the cheese exit and win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
