Players control an avatar (a moving character) to navigate through a level filled with obstacles and interactable objects.\n\n**Mechanics Overview:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game consists of various sprites, each with specific functions:\n  - **Floor:** Immutable grounded surface.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character (a rat in this context) that can move within the environment.\n  - **Boxes:** Static objects that can be pushed, which causes bounces and indirect effects.\n  - **Exit:** A door that represents the goal (reward upon reaching).\n  - **Holes:** Dangerous areas that can kill the player or remove objects.\n  - **Walls:** Impassable boundaries preventing movement.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - Collisions with walls send the player/avatar back.\n  - Hitting a box propels the avatar forward.\n  - Boxes can affect the exit and can be destroyed when falling into a hole.\n  - The player can collect points by reaching the exit and loses points by falling into holes.\n\n**Objectives:**  \nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level to reach the exit while avoiding holes and managing the boxes effectively. The player aims to maximize their score by reaching the exit without falling into any holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player **wins** by reaching the exit (when `exit` sprite limit reaches 0).\n- The player **loses** if the avatar (player) is removed (when `avatar` sprite limit reaches 0) or if time runs out (timeout limit of 1000).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Environment:**\n   - Take your time to understand the layout of the level. Observe where walls, boxes, holes, and the exit are located.\n\n2. **Plan Box Movement:**\n   - Use boxes to your advantage. Determine how you can move boxes to clear paths towards the exit while avoiding holes. Remember that pushing boxes can help you create safe routes.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - Keep an eye on hole placements and avoid jumping into them or pushing boxes into them willy-nilly, as they can end your run or remove valuable resources (boxes).\n\n4. **Achieving the Exit:**\n   - Always keep the exit in sight and plan your route so that you can reach it safely. Use the existing walls and boxes to create pathways while keeping an eye on possible pitfalls.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Be aware of the time limit (1000). While planning is critical, don\u2019t take too long; balance exploration with decisive action to get to the exit.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll increase your chances of successfully completing the level while maximizing your score and minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

This would potentially allow me to assess nearby boxes or move towards the exit\u2019s direction more effectively, as moving downwards would lead me to a row with more boxes (@) available.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should shift the avatar downwards, potentially providing more options to reach the exit while avoiding holes. I will assess the new position after this action.",
