Pushing a box into a wall causes it to bounce back, as does trying to walk into a wall.\n*   **Holes:** Holes are dangerous; moving into one kills the avatar and reduces the score. Boxes can be pushed into holes, which destroys the box. Holes act as teleporters.\n*   **Exits:** Reaching an exit increases the score.\n*   **Undo:** pushing a box into a wall, exit and a box at the same time triggers an undo action, reverting the entire game state.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary objective is to move the avatar to an exit (cheese) sprite.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All exits are removed from the board (presumably by the avatar reaching them all).\n*   **Loss:**\n    *   The player-controlled avatar dies (by entering a hole).\n    *   The game runs out of time (Timeout of 1000 steps).\n\n**Sprites:**\n\n*   `floor`: Background tile (brown).\n*   `avatar`: Player character (rat).\n*   `box`: Pushable object.\n*   `exit`: Goal (cheese).\n*   `hole`: Deadly trap (blue hole).\n*   `wall`: Obstacle.\n\n**Interactions Breakdown:**\n\n*   `avatar wall > stepBack`: Prevents the avatar from moving through walls.\n*   `box avatar > bounceForward`:  Avatar bounces back when pushing a box.\n*   `box wall exit box > undoAll`: Triggers an undo action when a box is simultaneously against a wall, next to an exit, and has another box next to it.\n*   `avatar hole > killSprite scoreChange=-1`: Avatar dies and score decreases when entering a hole.\n*   `exit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=1`: Avatar reaches the exit, the exit disappears, and the score increases.\n*   `box hole > killSprite`: Box disappears when pushed into a hole.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Walls\n*   `x`: Exit (Cheese)\n*   `h`: Hole\n*   `1`: Box\n*   `A`: Avatar (Rat)\n*   `.`: Floor\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestion:**\n\n1.  **Avoid Holes:** Holes are the most immediate threat. Plan routes carefully to avoid accidentally moving into them.\n2.  **Plan Box Movements:** Think several steps ahead when pushing boxes. It's easy to get boxes stuck in corners or in positions where they block your path.\n3.  **Optimize for Exits:** Prioritize moving the avatar to the exit location.\n4.  **Be Mindful of Time:** Don't waste time. The time limit is a factor.\n5.  **Understand the Undo Condition:** Carefully consider the placement of boxes, exits, and walls to avoid accidentally triggering the undo.\n\nIn essence, this is a puzzle game demanding spatial reasoning and careful planning, similar to classic Sokoban but with the added dangers of holes and undo actions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> @\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> a\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
