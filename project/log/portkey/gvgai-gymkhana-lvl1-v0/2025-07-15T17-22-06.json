    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to fit within the puzzle-platformer genre, where players navigate levels by solving spatial and resource-based puzzles, avoiding hazards, and progressing towards a goal. \n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various immovable sprites such as water, walls, logs, and goals. Each sprite performs a specific role, such as acting as hazards or platforms.\n- **Movement and Orientation:** The player (avatar) can move in four directions (north, south, east, and west) and must orient themselves accordingly to interact with the environment.\n- **Platforms and Hazards:** The logs serve as both platforms and moving entities within the game, while walls block movement. Water serves as a hazard that can eliminate the player upon contact.\n- **Interactions:** The avatar interacts with several elements:\n  - Moving log or landing pad can \"pull\" the avatar with it.\n  - The catapult can launch the avatar, leading to scoring and interaction with the goal.\n  - Players need to avoid interacting with hazards (like water and enemies) while using elements strategically to progress.\n  \n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the **goal** sprite (`g`) without being eliminated by hazards (water and walls) or running out of time. Players must score points through designated interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal while also fulfilling the criteria of the sprite counter for the goal, which is limiting it to zero.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero (indicating failure by either time out or falling into hazards) or if the time limit of 1000 units is reached without reaching the goal.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Environment Familiarization:**\n   - Study the layout to identify paths, hazards, and available resources. Each sprite offers either a chance for scoring or may act as a barrier.\n\n2. **Effective Movement:**\n   - Use the logs strategically without falling into water or being trapped by walls. The logs can assist in avoiding the water hazard.\n   - Prioritize navigating towards the landing pad or other pullable items to maintain movement while avoiding dangers.\n\n3. **Manage Timing:**\n   - Keep an eye on the time limit; it's essential to ensure that decisions are made promptly, especially in complex puzzles.\n  \n4. **Using the Catapult:**\n   - Make use of the catapult at optimal times. Timing the movement precisely can lead to greater scores while shortening the distance to the goal.\n\n5. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - Steer clear of water at all times. Recognize that interaction with the environment (e.g., logs) can mitigate risk, but only if done thoughtfully.\n   - Use obstacles (like walls) to your advantage to redirect and plan movements dynamically.\n\n6. **Score Maximization:**\n   - Consider scoring opportunities through utilizing the catapult effectively, ensuring each interaction with it yields a score.\n  \nBy effectively combining these strategies while adapting to the evolving game dynamics, players can optimize their chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater ->

    "content": "To assess the current state of the game based on the provided map, I see that my avatar (\"a\") is located in one of the rows with multiple movement options. The game has several elements that could be interacted with to reach the goal sprite (\"#\") at (14, 15).\n\n### Current Cursor Point:\n- My avatar's position is unknown since the \"a\" (avatar) character is not present in the current map. However, from context, it seems that we should be either at (1, 11) or (2, 5), based on the presence of interactive surfaces like logs (@) and other obstacles.\n- The goal (\"#\") is located at (14, 15), so my objective is to maneuver through the level effectively.\n\n### Nearest Interaction:\nThere are catapults (@) and landing pads ($) nearby, located at several rows within the possibility of movement. Utilizing these will be pivotal for reaching the goal effectively.\n\n### Decision Making:\nSince no previous actions have been indicated, I'll choose to move right to unlock potential new interactions with my environment. In the context of these game mechanics, moving right is a strategic decision with hopes of finding a better path towards the goal or to score through logs and landing pads.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action should help me progress towards the goal, and I expect to possibly engage with the catapult for further movement beneficial towards reaching the end objective.",
