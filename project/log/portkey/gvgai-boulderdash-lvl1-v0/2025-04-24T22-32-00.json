The presence of various sprite types suggests a focus on exploration and interaction with the environment.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can collect resources, engage in combat, and navigate through the level.\n   - **Enemies**: Various creatures (crabs, butterflies) that can harm the avatar if not dealt with appropriately.\n   - **Resources**: Diamonds can be collected to score points. The player can also interact with walls, dirt, and boulders which can affect movement and positioning.\n   - **Walls/Dirt**: Impassable barriers that define the level's structure.\n   - **Boulders**: Act as movable obstacles that the player can use tactically against enemies or for solving puzzles.\n   - **Exit Door**: Requires the avatar to have collected a certain number of diamonds to progress. If the avatar has more than nine diamonds, they are unable to exit.\n\n2. **Combat**:\n   - The avatar can engage in combat with enemies using a sword mechanic, killing them and earning a score.\n   - Interactions between sprites can lead to different outcomes, such as damaging the avatar or transforming enemies into resources.\n\n3. **Resource Limitation**:\n   - Collecting diamonds is crucial for progression, and there's a limit to how many can be held, suggesting that resource management will be important.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the level, defeat enemies, collect diamonds, and reach the exit door (exitdoor) while ensuring the avatar remains alive.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit door when they have less than nine diamonds.\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar loses when its count reaches zero, indicating the player must manage health carefully, possibly through avoiding combat or effectively using the sword.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Thoroughly explore the level to find and collect diamonds while avoiding or defeating enemies as necessary to maintain health.\n2. **Enemy Management**: Use strategic positioning to defeat enemies with the sword, but be cautious as they can damage or kill the avatar.\n3. **Resource Collection**: Focus on collecting diamonds while keeping track not to exceed the allowed limit, ensuring you do not inadvertently lock yourself out of exiting the level.\n4. **Utilize Obstacles**: Use boulders and walls to block enemies or create safe passages. For instance, boulders can be moved to create a barrier or to harm enemies from above.\n5. **Plan Your Route**: Given the puzzles represented by the level layout, plan your route to maximize diamond collection while minimizing the risk of losing health.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively manage their resources and navigate the challenges presented by the enemies and level design to achieve victory in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbackground dirt -> '.'\nbackground -> '-'\nbackground exitdoor -> 'e'\nbackground boulder -> 'o'\nbackground diamond -> 'x'\nbackground crab -> 'c'\nbackground butterfly -> 'b'\nboulder -> '@'\nbutterfly -> '#'\ncrab -> '$'\ndiamond -> '%'\ndirt -> '&'\nexitdoor -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nsword -> 'd'\nboulder sword -> 'w'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb&&....&&&&&@&&&&&&@@@%@@b\nb&&..$.&&&&&&&&&*&&&%&&&%b\nb&&@%%@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&b\nb&&&&&&&&@@@@&&&&&$...&&&b\nb&.....&&%%%%&&&&&&&&@@&&b\nb&&%%&#&&&&&&&&&&&&&&%%@@b\nb&&&&.a@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&%%b\nb&&&&.%%%&&&&&@...&&&@&&&b\nb&&...&&&&&&&&%...&&&&@&&b\nb&&&@@&&&@@&&&&#..&&&&&&&b\nb&&&%%&&&%%&&&&&&&&&&%%&&b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb&&&&&&&&&&&b\nb&&&&&&.&&&&b\nb&&.&&%.&@..b\nb%@.&&%.&%..b\nb%@...&.&%$.b\nb&&&%a#.&@..b\nb&&&%@&&&&&&b\nb&&&%&&&&&&&b\nb%@&&&&%@&&&b\nb%@&&&&%@&&&b\nb&&&&&&%@&&&b\nb&&&&&&%@&&@b\nb&&&&&&&&&&&b\nb&&%@&&&&&&&b\nb&#..&&&&&&&b\nb&...&&&&&*&b\nb&...&&&&&&&b\nb&&&&&&&$&&&b\nb&&&&&&&.&&@b\nb&&&&&&&.&%@b\nb%&&@&%@.&&@b\nb%&@&&%@&&&%b\nb&&&&%@&&&&@b\nb&&&&%@&&&%@b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbb",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar's position is represented by 'a', which corresponds to the coordinates along with various surrounding elements:\n\n```\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\nb&&....&&&&&@&&&&&&@@@%@@b\nb&&..$.&&&&&&&&&*&&&%&&&%b\nb&&@%%@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&b\nb&&&&&&&&@@@@&&&&&$...&&&b\nb&.....&&%%%%&&&&&&&&@@&&b\nb&&%%&#&&&&&&&&&&&&&&%%@@b\nb&&&&.a@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&%%b\nb&&&&.%%%&&&&&@...&&&@&&&b\nb&&...&&&&&&&&%...&&&&@&&b\nb&&&@@&&&@@&&&&#..&&&&&&&b\nb&&&%%&&&%%&&&&&&&&&&%%&&b\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n```\n\n### Analyzing Surroundings:\n1. The avatar is surrounded by:\n   - **To the left**: dirt (.)\n   - **To the right**: a boulder (@)\n   - **Above**: empty space with dirt (.)\n   - **Below**: a boulder (@) and some resources.\n\n2. The goal is to collect diamonds (%), defeat enemies (like the crab ($) and butterfly (#)), and reach the exit door (*).\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- The avatar can move left (to a position with dirt), move right (to a boulder which will not be traversable), move down (to another boulder), or move up (to empty space with dirt).\n\n### Strategic Focus:\nConsidering the current surroundings and the need to optimize movement towards winning:\n1. **Moving Left**: The dirt (.) space would allow exploration back towards the left, which could be useful for navigating further away from any imminent threats.\n2. **Moving Up**: Avoids any immediate complications and keeps moving towards an area that has more dirt, which might be advantageous for strategic positioning.\n3. **Moving Right**: Although it's an option, the boulder (which is impassable) restricts movement to the right significantly.\n4. **Moving Down**: Leads to a boulder, although it is interactable, but may not provide immediate benefits.\n\n**Recommendation**: The safest and most useful strategic action is to move up into the empty space.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to explore the levels further up, creating opportunities for future movements or interactions without immediate threats nearby, aligning with the strategy of cautious exploration and resource collection.",
