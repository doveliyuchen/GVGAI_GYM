You control an avatar \u2013 a knight \u2013 who can push boxes around a grid filled with walls, floors, and holes. The gameplay involves carefully moving your avatar to position and push the boxes. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key points:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Core Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Puzzle: You must solve a puzzle by figuring out how to maneuver boxes through a room.\n\u2003\u2013 Movement & Pushing: Your avatar moves across a grid. When you bump into walls, you\u2019ll simply step back. When you push a box, it can \u201cbounce\u201d off your avatar \u2013 meaning its movement is affected by your push.\n\u2003\u2013 Special Interaction: If you push a box into a hole, that box is removed (killed, as the rule puts it), and you earn points. The goal is to remove all the boxes by sending them into holes.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: The level is won when all boxes have been removed\u2014i.e., every box has been successfully pushed into a hole.\n\u2003\u2013 Winning: The termination condition specifies that when the number of boxes reaches zero (SpriteCounter for box is 0), you win the level.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s no explicit loss condition given, although making a wrong move might force you to undo a series of moves (as indicated by the \u201cundoAll\u201d interaction triggered when boxes collide with walls and other boxes).\n\n\u2022 Puzzle Twist:\n\u2003\u2013 The rule \"box wall box > undoAll\" suggests that if you push a box into a tight space (squished between a wall and another box), it triggers a reset of your recent moves. This likely prevents you from getting irreversibly stuck, and it means you must think carefully about each push.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan Your Moves Ahead: Before pushing a box, consider where it will end up and ensure that the path to the hole isn\u2019t blocked by walls or other boxes.\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain Space to Maneuver: Avoid getting boxes cornered against walls or next to each other unless you intend a reset. Use the undo mechanic as a safety net, but try to work around it by keeping your moves reversible.\n\u2003\u2013 Prioritize Box Delivery: Focus on nudging each box toward a hole. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to reposition yourself before making the push so that it lands in the right spot.\n\u2003\u2013 Think in Sequences: Since one wrong move might force you to rely on \u201cundoAll,\u201d look several moves ahead to prevent unintended chain reactions. It\u2019s all about controlling the board and precisely timing your pushes.\n\nIn simple terms, you\u2019re solving a puzzle by guiding your knight to push boxes into holes in a confined, obstacle-filled space. Success comes from careful planning, well-timed moves, and sometimes a bit of trial and error. Enjoy the challenge!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> a\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> 0\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
