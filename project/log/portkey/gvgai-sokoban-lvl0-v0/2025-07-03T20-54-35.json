Players must navigate a space, interact with objects, and achieve specific goals based on the game's mechanics.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites**: The game has various sprites like walls, the avatar (player), holes, boxes, and floors. Some sprites are immovable (walls, holes, floor) while others are movable (the avatar, boxes).\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar interacts with walls by stepping back, suggesting that players must avoid walls to progress.\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes, indicating that the player can use boxes to move or navigate.\n  - Boxes can undo their actions when colliding with walls, which adds a layer of strategy regarding how to position them.\n  - If a box falls into a hole, it's removed from the game (and adds to the score), exposing a core gameplay loop of managing boxes effectively while avoiding losing them to holes.\n  \n**Objectives:**\nThe main objective in the game is to remove all boxes from the playfield by pushing them into holes. The player wins when there are no boxes left, as indicated by the termination condition (SpriteCounter limit=0 win=True).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when all boxes have been removed (colored coded to indicate score change when boxes are placed into holes).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game doesn\u2019t specify a direct loss condition in the rules provided, which could imply that the game ends when the objective is completed or possibly some other conditions not outlined like running into a hard-to-avoid obstacle.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion\n\n1. **Map Awareness**:\n   - Analyze the layout of the level at the start. Understand where the walls and holes are located to plot the best route for moving boxes.\n\n2. **Plan Box Movements**:\n   - Since boxes bounce off the avatar and interact with holes, plan your strategy on which boxes to push first. Try to cluster boxes if possible to move them in groups toward holes.\n\n3. **Avoid Deadlocks**:\n   - Be careful of pushing boxes against walls. If a box becomes stuck, it may prevent further movement. Use the bouncing mechanism to strategically navigate boxes around obstacles instead of directly pushing them into tight spaces.\n\n4. **Maximize Box Usage**:\n   - Look for opportunities to push multiple boxes toward holes in a single move. This requires foresight and planning.\n\n5. **Think Ahead**:\n   - Anticipate each move's outcome. When pushing a box, consider where it will end up and how it affects the surrounding space.\n\nFollowing these strategies and understanding mechanics will greatly enhance chances of successfully completing levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> 0\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> a\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The box at (5, 1) is within reach if I navigate upward.\n\n### Decision:\nI will choose to move **up** to (6, 1) to maintain proximity to the box at (5, 1) and prepare for potential box movement towards the hole at (5, 10).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows me to reposition strategically to engage with the nearby box.",
