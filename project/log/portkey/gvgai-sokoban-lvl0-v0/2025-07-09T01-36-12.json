    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to fall into the **puzzle** genre. Players must strategize the movement of objects to achieve specific goals while navigating obstacles.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Environment:**\n   - The **floor**, **walls**, **holes**, **boxes**, and the **avatar** are all sprites that interact in defined ways.\n   - The **floor** is a solid platform, **walls** block movement, **holes** serve as lethal traps, **boxes** can be pushed and bounced, and the **avatar** is the player's character.\n\n2. **Player Actions:**\n   - The avatar can move freely but cannot pass through walls.\n   - The avatar can interact with boxes, causing them to bounce when pushed.\n   - Boxes can be moved toward holes, and if they fall into a hole, they are removed (killed) from the game but also grant a score change.\n\n3. **Interactions:**\n   - If the avatar encounters a wall, it must step back (indicating collision).\n   - Pushing a box leads to a bouncing action instead of a simple move.\n   - Boxes cannot be stacked or moved against walls without consequences; interactions have specific undo rules.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes (indicated by the **SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True** condition). This suggests that the player needs to remove all boxes from the game area. The scoring system deems that dropping a box into a hole contributes to the player's score.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** All boxes must be removed from the game area (i.e., there should be no remaining boxes).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game does not specify a direct loss condition, which suggests that players might have unlimited attempts unless additional rules exist elsewhere in the game structure.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Analyze the layout before making moves. Consider how pushing a box affects its position relative to walls and holes.\n   \n2. **Use Bounces Wisely:** When pushing boxes, be mindful of how the bouncing mechanic can lead to unintended consequences. Ensure you\u2019re not pushing boxes that will bounce into walls or each other uncontrollably.\n   \n3. **Prioritize Box Movement:** Focus on moving boxes towards holes, but do so carefully. Make sure that other paths are clear and that the boxes will not get stuck due to poor positioning after being bounced.\n\n4. **Watch Out for Walls:** Since walls can cause a step back, be strategic about your positioning. Avoid pushing boxes that could end up stuck against walls or in a position that makes them difficult to move later.\n\n5. **Use the Avatar's Movement:** Make the most out of your avatar's mobility, planning multiple steps ahead for complex moves that involve multiple boxes.\n\nBy following these guidelines and being mindful of the interactions and mechanics at play, players can enhance their strategic approach to the puzzle, leading to a successful completion of the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> 0\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The closest box that can potentially be pushed into a hole is at (row=2, col=11), but it would require several moves to get there.\n\nGiven the current position, I will check the next possible actions. The two nearest boxes to the avatar are at (1, 1) and (7, 1). Moving left from (4, 3) would not result in a valid action (as it would run into a wall).\n\nFrom this position, I can move down to see if I can interact with any other boxes or holes effectively. \n\nThe next action I plan to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action, moving down, will allow me to explore my options further with the box above (at row=2, col=11) or assess other surrounding boxes. It aligns with my strategy of exploring movement options.",
