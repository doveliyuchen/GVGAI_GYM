    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the video game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar pushes boxes around the level.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Players need to plan moves carefully to avoid getting boxes stuck.\n*   **Object Interaction:** Key mechanics revolve around how boxes interact with holes, walls, and the avatar.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Get all the boxes into the holes.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The game is won when there are no more boxes left on the level (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`).\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   The rules don't explicitly define a loss condition, but the player can effectively lose if they push a box into a corner or against a wall in such a way that it can no longer be pushed into a hole. This creates an unsolvable state.\n\n**Sprite Summary:**\n\n*   **Avatar (A):** The player-controlled character. Pushes boxes.\n*   **Box (1):** The objects that need to be pushed into holes.\n*   **Hole (0):** The target destination for boxes.\n*   **Wall (w):** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **Floor (.):** Empty space where the avatar and boxes can move.\n\n**Interaction Summary:**\n\n*   **Avatar + Wall:** Avatar cannot pass through walls.\n*   **Box + Avatar:** Avatar pushes the box forward (in the direction of movement).\n*   **Box + Wall + Box:** Action gets undone.\n*   **Box + Hole:** Box disappears, and the player gets a point (likely contributing to level completion).\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   The level is small and contained.\n*   The initial placement of boxes and holes suggests that careful planning is required. Some boxes might be harder to reach than others.\n*   The placement of walls creates chokepoints and limits maneuverability.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Before making any moves, scan the level and visualize the potential consequences of each push.\n2.  **Prioritize:** Identify the easiest boxes to move into holes first. This can open up space for maneuvering later on.\n3.  **Avoid Corners:** Be extremely careful not to push boxes into corners or against walls where they become impossible to move.\n4.  **Think Several Steps Ahead:** Sokoban-style games often require thinking several moves in advance to avoid getting stuck.\n5.  **Restart if Necessary:** Don't be afraid to restart the level if you realize you've made a mistake that makes the puzzle unsolvable.\n6.  **Use Undo with Caution:** It seems `box wall box > undoAll` can undo to the last move but it is better to avoid such situations.\n\nIn summary, this is a classic Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player must strategically push boxes into holes to win. Careful planning and spatial reasoning are essential for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> a\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> 0\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
