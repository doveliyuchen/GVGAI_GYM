You control an avatar in a grid-based level with obstacles, walls, and movable boxes.\n\n\u2022 Main Game Elements:\n\u2003\u2013 Avatar: You guide a knight-like character who moves around the level.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes: These are movable blocks that you must manipulate.\n\u2003\u2013 Holes: Special tiles (colored dark blue) that remove boxes when a box moves onto one.\n\u2003\u2013 Walls and Floor: Walls block movement, while floors serve as open space. There\u2019s a fixed background layout.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Movement: You move your avatar around the level. When encountering walls, the avatar can\u2019t pass through and will bounce back.\n\u2003\u2013 Pushing Boxes: When you move into a box, the box gets pushed (or \u201cbounces forward\u201d) in the direction of your movement.\n\u2003\u2013 Special Interaction with Holes: If you push a box so that it goes over a hole, the box is \u201ckilled\u201d (removed) and you earn a point.\n\u2003\u2013 Undo Mechanic: There\u2019s an interesting twist where if a box interacts with a wall and another box (interaction \u201cbox wall box\u201d), the game undoes all moves\u2014encouraging you to be careful with your pushes.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: Remove all boxes from the level by pushing them into holes.\n\u2003\u2013 Win Condition: The level is won when there are no boxes left (the SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n\u2003\u2013 There isn\u2019t an explicit loss condition mentioned, but making poor moves might force you to undo actions and waste moves, so efficiency and planning are key.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Plan Your Moves: Survey the level layout carefully. Identify the location of boxes and holes, and plan a route that allows you to push boxes into holes without getting stuck.\n\u20032. Manage the Undo Risk: Since certain interactions (like a box colliding with both a wall and another box) trigger an undo of all moves, think several steps ahead to avoid accidental chain reactions.\n\u20033. Optimize Movement: Find paths where you can push boxes efficiently towards holes without unnecessary detours\u2014and avoid getting your avatar trapped against walls.\n\u20034. Consider Order of Operations: Sometimes the order in which you push boxes matters. Ensure that moving one box doesn\u2019t block the path for another.\n\u20035. Adapt if Needed: If you run into a tricky configuration, use the undo feature (triggered automatically by the game) to backtrack and try a different approach.\n\nIn summary, treat the game like a grid-based puzzle where each move must be considered carefully to clear boxes by pushing them into holes. Think ahead, plan the order of your moves, and navigate carefully to achieve the objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> a\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> 0\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
