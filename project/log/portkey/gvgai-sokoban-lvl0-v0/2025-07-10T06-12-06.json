You control an avatar\u2014a knight\u2014that can move around a level filled with walls, boxes, floor spots, and holes. The main challenge is to eliminate all the boxes by pushing them into holes.\n\nKey elements include:\n\n\u2022 Genre: It\u2019s a puzzle game with elements of spatial strategy. You must carefully maneuver objects around a grid-like level.\n\n\u2022 Mechanics:\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 The avatar is the player\u2019s piece and is able to move around the level.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Boxes are passive objects which you have to interact with. When a box touches a hole, the game \u201ckills\u201d that box (removing it) and you gain points.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Walls block movement; if the avatar bumps into a wall the move is undone (stepBack).\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 There\u2019s also an interesting interaction where if a box collides with your avatar it\u2019s bounced forward, and another interaction where boxes contacting walls can trigger an undo of moves. These interactions add a twist; you need to be careful with the order and direction of your moves, as a wrong push could force you to retrace your steps.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 The objective is to eliminate all boxes from the level. The win condition is defined by having zero boxes remaining on the board.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 There isn\u2019t an explicit loss condition mentioned in the game rules, though you might get stuck or forced into undoing progress if moves are mishandled.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Plan ahead. Look at the arrangement of boxes, walls, and holes, and decide the order in which you\u2019ll push each box into a hole.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Avoid pushing boxes into positions where they are blocked by walls or where the undo-triggering interactions might force you back.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Use the avatar\u2019s movement to position yourself in a way that you can launch boxes accurately into holes.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Think about the knock-on effects of each push\u2014since some interactions can bounce a box or even trigger an undo move, take your time to consider each move carefully.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Prioritize moves that progress toward the goal (removing boxes) and avoid unnecessary moves that could lead to complex scenarios with boxes blocking each other.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re solving a spatial puzzle: using your knight to carefully push boxes into holes without getting your moves undone by extra interactions. With thoughtful planning and careful execution, you\u2019ll be able to clear the board and win the level. Enjoy puzzling it out!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> a\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
