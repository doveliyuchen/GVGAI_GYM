The mechanics and layout suggest a focus on solving spatial challenges (e.g., moving boxes) while navigating obstacles and ensuring an avatar makes strategic movements within a confined environment.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Areas where the avatar can move.\n   - **Hole**: A trap that eliminates the box when it falls into it, scoring points.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move in conjunction with the game's rules.\n   - **Box**: An item that can be moved and interacts with the environment (including bouncing back from the avatar\u2019s actions).\n   - **Wall**: A boundary that the avatar cannot pass through but can interact with boxes.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar steps back if it collides with a wall.\n   - When the avatar meets a box, it bounces forward.\n   - If boxes collide with walls, all box movements can be undone.\n   - If a box falls into a hole, it is removed from the level, resulting in a score increase.\n\n#### Objective\nThe goal is to eliminate all boxes from the level. To achieve this, players must strategically navigate the avatar to push boxes toward the holes while avoiding walls.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Victory is achieved when there are no boxes left (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: Although explicit loss conditions aren't stated, the player may face stalemates if they cannot maneuver boxes into holes due to walls or miscalculations.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before moving the avatar, consider how each action affects the position of boxes and pathways. Think several steps ahead to avoid entrapment.\n2. **Utilize Bounces**: Use the bounce mechanic to position boxes strategically. If a box can be pushed into an optimal position to fall into a hole, plan your movements accordingly.\n3. **Avoid Walls**: Movements should minimize contact with walls, as colliding with them leads to setbacks (stepping back).\n4. **Count Your Boxes**: Keep track of how many boxes are left and aim for simultaneous moves that can eliminate as many as possible efficiently.\n5. **Learn From Mistakes**: If a box is positioned poorly (for example, it's too close to a wall), consider undoing the last series of moves to try a different approach.\n\nBy engaging these strategies, players can improve their efficiency in clearing the level of boxes, ultimately leading to a successful victory condition. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> 0\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> a\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar (represented by `a`) is located at (row 6, col 1). The immediate surrounding space consists of a few boxes (`@`) that can potentially be moved into holes (`0`) to score points.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves:\n- The avatar can move left, right, up, or down, but walls (`w`) surround most of the playable area, limiting options.\n- To its left (col 0, row 6) is a wall (`w`). \n- To its right (col 2, row 6) is a floor space (`.`).\n- Up (col 1, row 5) is a floor space (`.`), but there's a box directly above that (at row 7, col 1).\n- Down (col 1, row 7) has another box (`@`).\n\n### Strategy:\nConsidering the strategy of planning moves and counting boxes, the immediate actionable move is down (to (row 7, col 1)). This will bring the avatar in contact with the box directly below, allowing for the potential of moving that box into the hole in row 5, col 10 in subsequent actions.\n\nLet's proceed with the move:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down, positioning it next to the box and setting up for further moves to eliminate boxes effectively.",
