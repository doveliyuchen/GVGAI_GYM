The food is essential, especially in situations where time is critical because of the health drain.\n   \n2. **Path Navigation**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout to identify optimal paths. Avoid unnecessary detours which may expose you to taking damage if you\u2019re not collecting food regularly.\n\n3. **Wall Avoidance**: Be cautious around walls to avoid rebounding back, which can disrupt progress. Plan your movements to circumvent walls efficiently.\n\n4. **Timely Actions**: Keep an eye on the timer related to health deduction. Maximize your movement to minimize idle time, especially when food resources are limited.\n\n5. **Scoring Focus**: Whenever possible, try to reach the foodbank in addition to regular food pickups to maximize health and score, providing a buffer in case you encounter health loss later.\n\nIn summary, engage actively with surroundings, manage health through food collection, and maintain attention to level layout for optimal navigation towards the goal. Happy gaming!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfood foodbank -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> $\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> $\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> $\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> a\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=8 -> $\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=10 -> $\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> .\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> #\nrow=12, col=2 -> $\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> $\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is at position (10, 7), and the goal is located at (12, 1). There is food located at (7, 3) which can help maintain health. The walls are around the edges of the map, and moving forward will require careful navigation.\n\nThe main objective is to reach the goal while managing health through collecting food. The most immediate need is to start moving effectively towards the goal or towards the food resource. \n\nSince the avatar is at (10, 7), moving left to (10, 6) does not seem as fruitful, as there are no resources there and the path is unclear. Moving down to (11, 7) would still be surrounded by walls with no food resources. Thus, the optimal choice is to move up to (9, 7), which will clear the immediate wall and allow further progression.\n\nLet\u2019s take the action to move up.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \nMoving up to (9, 7) is a strategic decision to navigate past walls and keep the options open for further movement towards resources and objectives.",
