Elements reminiscent of classic puzzle games such as Sokoban or more modern tile-based games can be identified.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent the player's avatar, obstacles (walls), movable objects (boxes), and goals. Specific sprites can transform into other types and have unique interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The game features a complex set of interactions where moving the 'avatar' (the player character) or certain objects can lead to a variety of outcomes, such as:\n   - Transforming one object into another.\n   - Attracting or pushing objects.\n   - Undoing actions based on specific conditions.\n3. **Movement**: The avatar can push boxes, interact with walls, and has to navigate through obstacles to achieve goals.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, manipulating boxes and boulders to reach the goal while avoiding traps (like holes) that will decrease your score or result in failure. You need to ensure that specific boulders (targetBoulder) are moved to their respective locations.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- You **win** the level if you manage to move all targetBoulders to the goal while keeping your avatar intact and within the allowable movements (avoiding deaths from falling into the hole).\n- You **lose** if the avatar is eliminated (e.g., falls into a hole), if there are no targetBoulders left, or if the timer reaches zero without completing objectives.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before executing, analyze how each move impacts the position of the boxes and boulders. Look for sequences that can lead to multiple transformations without backtracking.\n2. **Avoid the Holes**: Ensure you maintain awareness of hole locations. This applies to both the avatar and other sprites, as fatalities will result in penalties or failure.\n3. **Utilize Transformations**: Take advantage of the interactions that allow transforming one type of sprite into another. It gives you more flexibility to maneuver them around the board.\n4. **Pushing vs. Pulling**: Sometimes it's more strategic to pull or keep a boulder in place rather than pushing it. Consider the layout and how your next moves will affect boulders and boxes.\n5. **Stay Organized**: Maintain a clear pathway to the goal. Avoid unnecessary moves that could result in isolated boxes or boulders, making it harder to achieve the goal.\n6. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit to ensure you are progressing efficiently towards your objective.\n\nBy utilizing thoughtful movement, strategic interaction with sprites, and maintaining focus on your goals, players can successfully navigate through the puzzle and win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\nboulderm floor -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> %\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> *\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> f\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is located at (row 6, col 5). It appears the surrounding area has a few important elements:\n\n- To the north (row 5, col 5) is a masterBoulder (represented by `*`).\n- To the south (row 7, col 5) is a hole (represented by `#`).\n- To the east (row 6, col 6) is an empty square (represented by `.`).\n- To the west (row 6, col 4) is an empty square (represented by `.`).\n\nGoals include moving boulders and avoiding holes. The immediate danger for the avatar is the hole directly below, which could lead to losing the game if it's encountered.\n\nSince the avatar can interact with the masterBoulder directly above it, I'll choose to push the masterBoulder down, which will simultaneously occupy the current position while leaving the avatar in a safer position without moving into the hole. \n\nThe action to take is: \n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action pushes the masterBoulder down into the (row 6, col 5), which clears the way and keeps the avatar safe. I expect this aligns well with the strategy of planning effective moves, utilizing interactions, and avoiding holes.",
