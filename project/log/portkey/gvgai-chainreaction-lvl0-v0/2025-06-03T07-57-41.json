The use of different types of \"sprites\" suggests that the focus is on manipulating objects to solve challenges and progress through the environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites**: Various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls and holes), movable objects (boxes and boulders), and the player's avatar. The interaction of these sprites is critical to the gameplay.\n  \n2. **Transformation and Interaction**: The game features a variety of interactions between sprites. For example:\n   - A \"masterBoulder\" can be transformed into a \"mboulderm\" when the avatar interacts with it.\n   - Interactions with boxes and walls often result in bouncing back or undoing previous actions.\n   - Different boulders have specific attributes and can transform into one another based on interactions.\n\n3. **Goals and Actions**: The player must navigate the level using the avatar to manipulate boxes and boulders to reach the goal or \u201cexit\u201d while avoiding pitfalls like holes.\n\n**Objectives:**  \n- The primary objective is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while managing the \u201ctargetBoulder\u201d.\n- Players are scored based on their actions, and they need to strategically move objects while avoiding penalties from colliding with holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Conditions**: Achieved by ensuring there are no more \"targetBoulder\" sprites left in the level.\n- **Loss Conditions**: If the avatar is eliminated (with a score penalty) or if certain important objects (e.g., \"master\") reach a count of zero, the player loses. A timeout also results in a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since the environment is filled with immovable walls and obstacles, it is crucial to think several steps ahead. Determine the most efficient path to reach the goal while managing boulders and boxes.\n\n2. **Utilize Transforms**: Take advantage of the transformation mechanics. Learn how different interactions can change the type of boulders or boxes, allowing you to remove obstacles or create new pathways.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Holes present a significant risk; losing points or even the game due to interactions with holes necessitates careful navigation. Always be mindful of positioning around holes and plan alternate routes.\n\n4. **Maximize Score**: Whenever possible, aim to score by successfully getting boulders to the goal instead of losing points by interacting with holes. Balancing the movement of multiple sprites can obstruct potential losses.\n\n5. **Controlled Manipulation**: Use boxes to bounce off walls intentionally to produce a desired effect, such as moving other boulders strategically.\n\n6. **Learn from Each Attempt**: If you fail to meet the win conditions, analyze which interactions led to that failure. Gather insights on how certain moves resulted in unintended consequences.\n\nBy combining careful planning, strategic interactions, and an understanding of the sprite transformations, players can effectively reach the goal while minimizing risks and maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\nboulderm floor -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> %\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> %\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> a\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar (positioned at row 5, column 14) is adjacent to a normal boulder (positioned at 5, column 9) and multiple potential paths leading to goal sprites ('@') located at row 2, column 2 and row 8, column 10. There are also holes represented by '#' which must be avoided.\n\nTo move effectively in this situation, I will first check if any useful interactions with objects can be made and whether I can reach a goal while managing the risk of holes.\n\nSince my avatar has not changed position in the last round, my first action should be to examine my surroundings again. The quickest route to a goal is via moving up a few levels, but direct access to the exit requires maneuvering around objects carefully.\n\nThe next meaningful action would be to move 'up' since my next target is to eventually utilize the goal at row 2, column 2 in a future play iteration.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI expect this action will help navigate towards the goal and assess the immediate reactions of the other sprites in the next state.",
