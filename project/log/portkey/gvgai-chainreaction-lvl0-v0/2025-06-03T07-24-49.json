    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and a proposed strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game resembles a **puzzle-adventure** genre, with elements reminiscent of **block-pushing puzzles** (similar to games like *Sokoban*). Players must navigate through a grid-based environment, manipulating various objects (like boxes and boulders) to achieve specific objectives.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game has various interactive sprites, including an avatar (player character), different types of boulders, boxes, walls, holes, and a goal.\n- **Interaction Types**: \n  - The avatar can interact with boulders to change their type (e.g., normal boulders can become stopping boulders or transform into master boulders).\n  - Boxes can bounce the avatar, pushing them back and resetting their states.\n  - Collisions with walls or holes result in the avatar stepping back or scoring penalties.\n  - Successfully moving a boulder into the goal gives points, while falling into a hole or causing other sprites to fall results in scoring penalties.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the environment, manipulate the boulders and boxes, and ensure that:\n1. All **target boulders** (identified sprites) are eliminated (counter reaches 0).\n2. The player should avoid losing all avatars and not allow the score to drop too low.\n3. Achieve a high enough score by strategically placing boulders in the goal while managing holes to mitigate score penalties.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player loses if the **SpriteCounter** for the avatar reaches 0.\n- The player wins if the **SpriteCounter** for **target boulders** reaches 0.\n- Time must be managed since there\u2019s a timeout set on struggling to complete the level.\n- The player scores points by correctly managing the boulders and moving them into the goal while avoiding holes.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Read the Level Layout**: Understand the grid and identify the locations of the boulders, boxes, holes, and goals.\n2. **Plan Movements**: Before making moves, consider how each action impacts the state of the boulders and boxes \u2014 this is crucial since many interactions have a cascading effect.\n3. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Use boxes to manipulate boulders effectively, bouncing them to reset potential penalty situations while guiding them towards the goal.\n4. **Manage Boulders Wisely**: Be careful when moving normal boulders around. They can change types, attract others, or cause undesirable movement towards holes. Ensure you understand the transformations.\n5. **Avoid Holes**: Make sure to navigate carefully around holes to prevent loss points. Always have an escape route to avoid stepping into them.\n6. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer to avoid losing due to time out. Work towards quickly reducing the target boulders without sacrificing avatar safety.\n7. **Test Different Moves**: If possible, experiment with interacting with various sprites to observe different outcomes and find optimal paths to success.\n\nBy executing these strategies and remembering the interaction mechanics, players can enhance their chances of winning this puzzle-adventure game while minimizing their score losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> a\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> %\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> %\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",
