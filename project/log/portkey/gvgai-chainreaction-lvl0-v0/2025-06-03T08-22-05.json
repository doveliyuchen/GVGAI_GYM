Players will need to navigate through a grid-based layout while dealing with various interactive sprites.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various types of sprites are present, each with specific interactions and behaviors (e.g., walls, holes, goals, various types of boulders).\n- **Avatar Control:** The player controls an avatar that can interact with different sprites.\n- **Transformations:** Certain interactions allow the avatar to transform boulders, which can change their behavior (e.g., speed changes).\n- **Obstacle Navigation:** Players must navigate around walls, holes, and goal areas while managing boulders and boxes that can influence paths and strategies.\n- **Score System:** Achieving specific interactions can yield positive or negative scores. The goal is to minimize negative score interactions and maximize positive score interactions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective appears to be to reach the \"goal\" sprite while manipulating the environment\u2014specifically the boulders and boxes. Players also need to eliminate the \"master\" and \"target\" boulders while avoiding detrimental interactions with \"holes\" and ensuring their avatar stays on the board.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:** The game is won if all target boulders are eliminated from the level.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The game is lost if the avatar isn't present (sprite counter reaches zero) or if certain time limits are exceeded.\n- **Score Penalties:** Interacting with holes results in a score deduction, highlighting the risks involved in navigating them.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Before acting, consider the effects of moving the avatar or any boulders/boxes. Visualize how these actions will influence your subsequent moves.\n\n2. **Manage Boulders Wisely:**\n   - Use the transformation mechanics effectively. For example, the master boulders can change states to become mboulders, but be cautious about how many times you switch states as it can lead to unintended consequences.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes and Walls:**\n   - Keep the avatar away from holes and walls to prevent negative scoring penalties and backward motions. Using other obstacles should factor into your route planning.\n\n4. **Prioritize Goals:**\n   - Focus on clearing the target boulders and getting them to the goal while ensuring your avatar remains safe. Follow paths which lead them without getting trapped or scoring penalties.\n\n5. **Utilize Box and Boulder Interactions:**\n   - Explore how boxes can bounce off of walls and be used strategically to alter the position of boulders, especially those that you need to convert to meet your objectives.\n\n6. **Watch Your Timer:**\n   - Since there is a timeout condition, ensure that your moves are efficient to prevent getting stuck on decisions.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can navigate through the levels efficiently and progress toward completing the game objectives while avoiding penalties.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> %\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> %\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> %\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> a\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, we see the avatar 'a' is positioned at (8, 5) on the grid. The objective is to manage boulders and other obstacles while navigating towards the goals identified by '@' symbols.\n\nThere are various goals within the immediate area:\n- At (2, 2) and (5, 15) as visible goal sprites.\n\nThe surrounding environment influences movement:\n- Directly above the avatar at (7, 5) is a hole ('#') which presents a risk of scoring deductions if I were to move there.\n- The lay of the grid allows movement without immediate obstacles, although care needs to be taken about interactions with the goals and boulders.\n\nSince the previous action likely resulted in no change, it's essential to engage the avatar further to make progress towards completing objectives. I can either make lateral moves to check for boulders to interact with or work my way towards a goal. \n\nConsidering the spatial relationship of the functions, I will move my avatar upward to (7, 5) as it\u2019s a pivotal point of interaction and management.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should allow me to approach the hole area strategically and analyze whether there are favorable interactions, while also staying aware of my avatar's position to prevent future negative score penalties.",
