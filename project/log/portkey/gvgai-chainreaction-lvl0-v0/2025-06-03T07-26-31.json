The rules indicate a combination of strategic planning and spatial reasoning.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as the avatar, different types of boulders, boxes, walls, holes, and goals. Each sprite has distinct properties and effects.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with boulders, boxes, walls, and holes in ways that alter their states (transforming, stepping back, or changing their type).\n   - Different boulders can transform into several types based on interactions, affecting their speed and function.\n   - The avatar must navigate around obstacles, and the position of objects can significantly impact movement and strategy.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main goal is for the avatar to navigate through the environment to collect or manipulate boulders, boxes, and ultimately reach the goal. Specifically:\n- Collect or convert the `targetBoulder` type until there are none left to win.\n- Avoid the holes and manipulate boxes strategically, as falling in one will incur a score penalty.\n  \n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win** if there are no `targetBoulders` remaining.\n- **Lose** if the avatar (or related sprites) falls into a hole or if certain sprites reach zero count (e.g., `master`).\n\n#### Level Layout:\nThe level is bordered by walls, creating a labyrinthine structure with various pathways. There are holes and goals placed within, requiring the player to navigate carefully. The layout indicates potential bottlenecks and areas where the player could easily get stuck if not careful.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Always analyze future moves before acting. Consider how every interaction (like pushing a box or moving a boulder) might change the state of the game.\n2. **Avoid Holes**: Keep a safe distance from holes, as they incur a score penalty. Use strategic positioning to keep the avatar away from edges.\n3. **Manipulate Boulders Wisely**: Use the different states of boulders to your advantage, knowing when to attract gaze and when to avoid them.\n4. **Use Boxes as Shields**: If boulders are causing issues, consider using boxes to maneuver around them or block paths.\n5. **Focus on Goals**: Identify the goal locations and plan movement towards those while managing other sprite interactions. Collect boulders with a clear understanding of potential hazards.\n\nBy employing this strategy, players will enhance their ability to navigate levels, collect necessary items, and avoid pitfalls efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\nboulderm floor -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> %\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

Observing the surroundings, here are some critical points:\n\n- There are walls surrounding the area, indicated by '&'.\n- The avatar can move in four directions: left, right, up, and down.\n- The avatar must navigate to manipulate boulders and reach goals or objectives while avoiding holes and walls.\n\nNext, let's consider the actions:\n\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (to 6, 4)**: There's an empty space ('.').\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (to 6, 6)**: There's an empty space ('.').\n3. **ACTION_UP (to 5, 5)**: There's an empty space ('.').\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (to 7, 5)**: There's a hole ('#'), which incurs a score penalty.\n\nPlan: The strategic move is to either move left or right, but considering the avatar's position and potential future actions, moving up to (5, 5) appears the best option since it opens up a space toward the goal and avoids falling into a hole.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar up, allowing for potential further navigation toward goals while avoiding hazards. I expect this to align with the strategy of planning moves ahead while ensuring safety from nearby holes.",
