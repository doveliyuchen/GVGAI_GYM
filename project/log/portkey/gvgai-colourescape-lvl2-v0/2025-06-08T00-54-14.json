It involves navigating a character through a maze-like environment with blocks and switches, while solving spatial and logical challenges.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Floors, walls, holes, and exit doors that define the boundaries of the environment.\n   - **Boxes and Switches**: Various colored boxes can interact differently with the player character (avatar) and each other. Switching between different colored avatars through mechanisms (switches) adds to the gameplay complexity.\n   - **Holes**: Acting as traps, falling into holes results in a score penalty and the loss of the player character.\n   - **Movement**: Players can interact with boxes and move backwards when encountering walls.\n  \n2. **Avatar Transformations**: Players can transform into different colored avatars by stepping on switches, which will affect how they interact with other elements in the game. Each avatar variation (normal, red, blue, green) has distinct abilities or effects when interacting with specific boxes.\n\n3. **Interactions**: This game emphasizes strategic movement and timing. Certain moves will undo previous actions or will bounce the avatar forward, while some result in triggering switches and solving puzzles.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the 'exit' sprite while strategically navigating through the level, manipulating boxes and switches, and avoiding traps (holes) to maximize score gain.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit sprite with their avatar, which grants a score increase.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar is no longer available if its count reaches zero (likely because it fell into a hole).\n  - Timing out before reaching the exit leads to a loss.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Understand Mechanics**: Take time to understand how each box and switch affects the avatars. Recognizing patterns in how they interact will be crucial for progressing through challenging sections.\n\n2. **Plan Movements**: Carefully plot movements while engaging with boxes and switches. Prioritize avoiding holes and maximize the use of your available avatars to manipulate the boxes effectively.\n\n3. **Transform Wisely**: Try to switch between avatars at strategic points where certain colored boxes can propel you forward or facilitate puzzle solving. For instance, ensure you're the right avatar when interacting with a box to bounce forward rather than undo actions.\n\n4. **Monitor the Timer**: Keep an eye on the timer (1500 as per the rules). If you're moving slowly or stuck on a puzzle, consider shifting strategies to ensure you don\u2019t get timed out.\n\n5. **Anticipate Box Interactions**: Understand that certain boxes undo progress if interacted with the wrong avatar. Create a path that clears obstacles before engaging the more complicated interactions.\n\n6. **Retain Flexibility**: If the route to the exit seems blocked or overly complicated, do not hesitate to backtrack. Maintaining flexibility in strategy can help find alternative paths or solutions.\n\nBy using these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the game's challenges, avoid penalties, and work toward achieving the exit to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> h\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> g\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> n\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> n\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> n\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> #\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> e\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> h\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",

Since my avatar is currently positioned on the same row as the blue switch and I cannot access it directly, I need to make a left movement in order to approach the left side of the map.\n\nConsidering the mechanics of the game where movements may have repercussions on how I can interact with the game objects, I will proceed with the action to move left. \n\nTherefore, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nMoving left should allow me to position myself better for future interactions with the nearby blue switch and open other paths in the maze-like environment.",
