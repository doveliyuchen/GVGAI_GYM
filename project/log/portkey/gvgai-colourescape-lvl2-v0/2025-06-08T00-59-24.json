The avatar can change colors by stepping on the respective switches.\n\n3. **Interactions:** Each interaction has specific outcomes, such as bouncing forward, undoing previous actions, or causing the avatar/boxes to be 'killed' or deactivated. The gameplay involves careful management of these interactions to progress.\n\n4. **Objective:** \n   - Navigate through the level, transform using switches, interact with boxes to reach the exit, and avoid holes.\n   - Collect as many points as possible by reaching the exit while minimizing score reductions from falling into holes.\n\n5. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - **Win condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit, represented by a successful transformation and movement to the exit door (scoring +1).\n   - **Loss conditions:** Losing all avatars (SpriteCounter limit = 0), timeout (1500 ticks) without reaching the exit, or falling into too many holes (score diminishes).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore and Familiarize:**\n   - Develop a good understanding of the level layout, identifying positions of the exit, tiles, and potential traps (holes).\n\n2. **Use Switches Effectively:** \n   - Make it a point to step on switches at necessary times to change to the appropriate colored avatar that can interact beneficially with colored boxes. \n\n3. **Careful Planning:**\n   - Use boxes to manipulate the environment effectively, leveraging their bouncing properties strategically. If you must maneuver around holes, consider leading boxes to create pathways or avoid traps when applicable.\n\n4. **Minimize Losses:** \n   - Since entering holes decreases score, avoid risky moves that could lead to loss of avatars or falling into traps, and plan a safe route to the exit.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the time limit as it affects the win condition. Efficient navigation is key to completing the level within the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Trial and Error:**\n   - The game mechanics suggest a trial-and-error approach could be beneficial for discovering which interactions yield the best results for progressing through the level. \n\nBy combining these strategies with a clear understanding of the game mechanics, players can effectively navigate challenges, collect scores, and aim for the exit to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> h\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> g\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> n\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> n\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> n\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> #\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> e\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> h\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
