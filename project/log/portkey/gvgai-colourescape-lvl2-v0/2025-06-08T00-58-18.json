The objective of the game involves spatial reasoning, interactions with various colored boxes and switches, and navigating a complex level layout.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:** \n   - Players control an avatar that interacts with various boxes (colored and regular), switches, walls, exits, holes, and the floor. \n   - Certain boxes (green, red, blue) have specific interactions with the avatar, leading to bouncing or undoing previous actions. \n   - The avatar can transform into different colored versions based on which switch it steps on.\n   \n2. **Movement and Obstacles:** \n   - The avatar can step back when hitting walls.\n   - Stepping on a hole results in the avatar being killed and losing points, while reaching the exit increases the score.\n\n3. **Grouping Mechanics:** \n   - The interactions suggest that boxes can be combined or manipulated with switches to affect the environment and progress through the level.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate the level to reach the exit while managing interactions with boxes and switches to create pathways or mitigate hazards (like holes).\n- Players must also avoid losing their avatar (which might imply a limited number of actions or lives) while trying to reach the exit.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Players win by getting the avatar to the exit, while a failure condition occurs if:\n  - The avatar is killed by stepping into a hole (leading to a score deduction).\n  - The avatar runs out of lives (indicated by a counter reaching zero).\n  - A timer runs out before reaching the exit.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Explore Each Level:** \n   - Start by exploring the level to understand the layout, where key components (boxes, switches, holes, and exits) are located.\n   - Take note of the different colored boxes and which switches correspond to the avatar types.\n\n2. **Plan Moves Thoughtfully:**\n   - Avoid unnecessary actions that could lead to losing the avatar or points. Be particularly cautious of the holes, and plan your movements to steer clear of them.\n\n3. **Utilize Bouncing Mechanic:**\n   - Use the bouncing mechanics strategically to propel the avatar closer to the exit or to leverage unique interactions with other sprites, especially colored boxes that might create an advantageous position.\n   \n4. **Transform and Adapt:**\n   - Use the switches to change the avatar\u2019s type, which may provide new movement or interaction advantages in dealing with other obstacles or puzzles present in the level.\n\n5. **Sequence Actions:**\n   - If there are multiple boxes and switches, plan a sequence of actions that maximizes movement towards the exit while ensuring you don\u2019t undo critical progress. \n\n6. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the game timer and prioritize actions that advance you toward the exit without getting trapped or delaying unnecessarily.\n\n7. **Practice Makes Perfect:** \n   - If a specific level presents challenges, practice different strategies and learn from mistakes. Adjust your approach for subsequent attempts based on what you learned.\n\nBy following these strategies, players should be able to navigate the levels effectively and reach the exit without losing their avatar or running out of time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> h\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> g\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> n\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> n\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> n\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> #\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> e\nrow=7, col=8 -> n\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> h\nrow=8, col=9 -> n\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
