This genre typically involves navigating a character through different levels, solving puzzles, and overcoming obstacles in order to reach a goal. \n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interaction:**\n   - The game includes various sprites such as `walls`, `boxes`, switches`, and an `avatar` that can move and interact with these elements. \n   - The `avatar` can transform into different colored versions (e.g., red, blue, green) depending on which switch it interacts with. Each color may have specific interactions with other objects in the game.\n   - Boxes can be used strategically, either to create paths or trigger bounce effects on the avatar or other sprites.\n   - There are holes (spikes) that will cause the avatar to lose points if they fall into them, and the goal is to reach an exit to gain points.\n\n2. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - The player wins by getting the avatar to the exit.\n   - The player loses if the avatar is killed (e.g., falls into a hole) or if all avatars are eliminated (SpriteCounter reaches limit 0).\n   - There is a timeout limit, suggesting a time-sensitive challenge where the player must complete the objective before time runs out.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective is to navigate the avatar to the exit (`exit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=1`) while avoiding pitfalls (holes) and making strategic use of switches and boxes.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Understand Sprite Interactions:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with how different colored avatars interact with various boxes and switches; this knowledge is essential for solving puzzles.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Positioning and bouncing off boxes can help you reach higher platforms or avoid dangerous areas. Always observe the surrounding environment to see how boxes can be utilized to progress.\n\n3. **Switch Colors Strategically:**\n   - Choose which switch to interact with based on the challenges you are facing. For example, if you need to navigate past areas that require specific box interactions, switch to the appropriate colored avatar.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes:**\n   - Steer clear of the holes to prevent point loss and potential game over scenarios. Assess the level layout to identify potential traps and plan your movements accordingly.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timeout limit and move swiftly but carefully. Rushing could lead to mistakes, but being overly cautious can waste crucial time.\n\n6. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Before making moves, analyze the layout (level map). Identify potential paths and think ahead about how to utilize switches and boxes effectively to reach the exit.\n\nBy combining these strategies, players can effectively navigate the puzzles and challenges of the game to reach the exit and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'w'\nredAvatar -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> h\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> g\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> n\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> n\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> #\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> n\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> n\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> #\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> n\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> n\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> h\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> f\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> n\nrow=8, col=15 -> h\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> n\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",

The important elements for navigation include the avatar symbol (not yet defined here), walls (r), the exit (%), holes (b), boxes (1, 2, 3), and switches (g, @, c, etc.).\n   \n2. As I process the layout, I notice the avatar is not specified directly in the state but can be inferred based on the layout around the colored switches and boxes. Since there are different colors of boxes and switches nearby, I suspect the avatar may be near the blue switch (@) at (row=2, col=2).\n\n3. The primary objective is to reach the exit (%), which is located at (row=2, col=16). To clarify the possible action, the next step involves evaluating the position regarding walls and holes.\n\nGiven the current position of the avatar and available actions, it seems it needs to navigate towards the exit. The avatar might need to use the boxes or switches effectively and avoid the holes.\n\n### Decision and Action:\n\nSince I'm at the blue switch (@) at (2, 2), the next step is to utilize the blue switch and analyze how it affects my avatar or other sprites around.\n\nI'll take an action to interact with the blue switch to potentially change the environment or the state of the avatar. I'll move to the right where the switch is located.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nAfter taking this action, I expect that the switch will affect the nearby sprites, allowing me to explore further, and I hope this aligns with progressing towards the exit safely and efficiently.",
