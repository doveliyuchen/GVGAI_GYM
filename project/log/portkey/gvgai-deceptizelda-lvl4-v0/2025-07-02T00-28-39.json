The player navigates a dungeon-like environment, interacts with objects and enemies, and possibly solves challenges to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Types**: Various sprites represent different game elements including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player character.\n   - **Goals**: Small and large goals that can be opened with keys.\n   - **Enemies**: Various types (quick, normal, slow) that pose a threat to the player.\n   - **Keys and Walls**: Keys are required to unlock certain goals and walls may impact movement.\n   - **Swords**: Used by the avatar and may be involved in combat against enemies and some interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The player can collect keys, destroy enemies, and interact with walls and goals.\n   - Players can only advance through smaller goals if they possess the key, while larger goals always yield points regardless of key possession.\n\n3. **Combat**: \n   - Combat is initiated by interacting with enemies using the sword, which can result in either gaining or losing score points.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to collect points by interacting with different goals (small and large) and to ultimately defeat enemies while managing paths through walls and collecting keys to advance.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Players win by interacting with the appropriate sprites (smallgoal or largegoal) to accumulate points or by conditions tied to sprite counters (indicating how many goals have been interacted with).\n- The game can end unfavorably for the player (loss condition) if the avatar is defeated by an enemy.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout, especially the locations of walls, enemies, and goals.\n   \n2. **Collect Keys**: Prioritize finding and picking up keys to unlock the smaller goals and maximize your score.\n\n3. **Engage Enemies Wisely**: Use your sword strategically to defeat enemies for points, but be cautious to avoid losing points if you are hit. Take advantage of the cooldowns on enemy spawning to plan your attacks.\n\n4. **Focus on Goals**: Prioritize destroying small goals and try to gather the needed keys for larger goals to maximize point collection.\n\n5. **Utilize Movement**: Take care in your movement around walls and avoid getting trapped by engaging enemies. Consider stepping back when necessary to assess the situation.\n\n6. **Efficient Resource Management**: Use only the amount of sword strikes needed, as there may be a limit to the number of actions or interactions you can perform in quick succession.\n\nBy following these strategies and being mindful of your interactions and opponents, you can efficiently navigate the game and aim for a high score while successfully completing the level objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nlargegoal monsterNormal -> 'n'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> *\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "The given state shows that the avatar is positioned at (row=10, col=9), which contains a sword ('*'), while there is also a small goal ('&') at (row=10, col=11) directly to the right. \n\nBased on the strategy to maximize points, the next logical step is to interact with the small goal. However, since I need to make sure that the avatar actually moves after the directional action, I will first rotate toward the goal and then move right.\n\n### Action Analysis\n1. **Rotate to the Right**: The avatar will rotate right towards the small goal. \n2. **Check Movement**: Since the goal is adjacent to the current position, moving right should yield a score.\n\nGiven these considerations, the appropriate action is:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will result in the avatar moving right towards the small goal, allowing for point collection as per the overall strategy.",
