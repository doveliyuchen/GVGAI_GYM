    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules and level layout you've provided, here is an analysis of the game:\n\n### Genre:\nThis game appears to fall into the **action-adventure** or **puzzle platformer** genre. It has elements of exploration, combat, and item collection.\n\n### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game uses various sprites, including the avatar (player character), enemies, walls, goals (small and large), keys, and other items.\n- **Movement and Interactions**: The avatar can move around the level, interact with other sprites (e.g., collect keys, fight enemies). It can also be blocked or pushed back by walls and certain enemies.\n- **Combat**: The avatar has the ability to attack enemies with a sword. Certain interactions can result in combat (for instance, attacking an enemy or an enemy attacking the avatar).\n- **Score System**: There is a scoring system based on interactions. The avatar gains points for certain actions (like defeating enemies or interacting with goals) and loses points for others (being attacked by enemies).\n\n### Objectives:\n- The primary objective appears to be collecting keys to access goals (small and large).\n- Players must defeat enemies and navigate through the level to unlock these goals and reach different outcomes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The player wins if they manage to achieve the conditions set by killing enough goal sprites (smallgoal and largegoal) or through accumulation of score via defeating enemies and collecting keys.\n- The game indicates a loss condition if the avatar is killed (scoreChange=-1). Presumably, if the avatar's score goes below a certain point (or if they are killed a certain number of times), the player may lose the game.\n\n###Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Move Carefully**: Take time to navigate the map, understanding where you can go and where enemies are located. Avoid unnecessary engagements with more powerful monsters.\n  \n2. **Collect Keys**: Focus on finding and collecting keys (the sprite with key) to unlock goal doors. Ensure to engage with the nokey sprite to obtain a key whenever possible.\n\n3. **Engage Wisely**: Attack enemies when you are confident you can win. Consider your health and score status before taking risks.\n\n4. **Prioritize Goals**: Try to reach and unlock the large goals first for higher points while managing enemy encounters effectively at the same time.\n\n5. **Watch Your Score**: Keep track of your score, ensuring you aren't taking unnecessary damage that could lead to a loss state. Find balance between attacking enemies for points and staying safe.\n\n6. **Defensive Play**: Given that there are multiple types of enemies that interact with your avatar, adopt a defensive playstyle when facing faster or stronger opponents, retreating when necessary and attacking when it's safe.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can better navigate the game's challenges and pursue the win condition effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nlargegoal monsterNormal -> 'm'\nnokey sword -> 'n'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> m\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> *\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

Here are the details:\n\n- My avatar is located at (10, 8), which corresponds to a sword ('*').\n- To the right of my avatar (position (10, 9)) is a floor tile ('.').\n- To the left (position (10, 7)) is another floor tile ('.').\n- Above (position (9, 8)) and below (position (11, 8)) are walls ('w').\n- The sprite at (10, 11) is a small goal ('&').\n- I also have access to a sword on my current tile, allowing me to attack enemies.\n\nCurrent strategy suggests that I should explore or interact effectively, so I will attempt to move towards the small goal to begin earning points.\n\nI will choose to move right to (10, 9), since it's a valid move, and I aim to increase engagement with achieving objectives.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to help me explore the area while getting closer to the small goal.",
