Players likely navigate a grid-based environment, combat enemies, and collect items to reach goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Player Character (Avatar)** - The player controls an avatar that can interact with various elements in the environment, particularly using a sword to attack enemies and destroy objects like vases.\n2. **Goals** - The game consists of small goals and large goals indicated by different colored doors (green and gold). These doors require different conditions to open, notably the presence of a key.\n3. **Keys and Objectives** - The player collects keys to unlock goals. The transformation that occurs when the avatar interacts with a key turns the avatar from 'nokey' (without key) to 'withkey' (with key), changing its capabilities.\n4. **Enemies** - There are various types of enemies that engage with the avatar. Players can defeat enemies for score points, but losing encounters will cause score penalties.\n5. **Vases** - Destroying vases yields additional score points.\n6. **Walls and Obstacles** - Certain walls are immovable, creating barriers requiring strategic navigation.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to collect the keys, defeat enemies, and reach the small and large goals (doors) to progress, ultimately aiming for the highest score. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they have a specific count of `smallgoal` or `largegoal` sprites defeated (indicated by successful interactions with the doors).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the `avatar` sprite's count reaches zero, which likely correlates to losing all health or lives.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Early Game Focus**: Initially focus on exploring the map to obtain the key. Smash vases en route for early score gains. Assess enemy types to make informed decisions during encounters.\n   \n2. **Key Management**: After collecting the key, engage the small and large goal doors, targeting the small goal first to maximize score opportunities, especially as it requires only one key to access.\n\n3. **Combat Techniques**: Beware of enemy cooldowns; engage them wisely. Utilize the sword to defeat enemies for additional scoring while being defensive to avoid health loss, especially avoiding direct confrontations with multiple enemies simultaneously.\n\n4. **Navigation & Planning**: Advance back to areas with goals after collecting keys, but maintain awareness of possible enemy spawn points to minimize ambush risks.\n\n5. **Resource Assessment**: Check the environment for vases along the way for extra score points. Avoid unnecessary engagements with enemies unless confident of victory, and only attack when it assures an advantage.\n\n6. **Final Push**: Once all goals are achieved, consider a strategy for optimization of score before concluding the level. Engage with remaining enemies where possible to maximize the score before exiting through the final goal.\n\nBy following this strategy, players will steadily progress through levels while maximizing their score and minimizing losses, enhancing their chances of success in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nwithkey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> *\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",
