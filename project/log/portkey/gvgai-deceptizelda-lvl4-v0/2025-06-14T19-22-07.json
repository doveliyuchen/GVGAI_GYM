Players navigate through a maze-like environment, collect items, and interact with various sprites.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Player Character (Avatar):** The player controls an avatar that can attack enemies and interact with other sprites (objects).\n2. **Collectibles and Goals:** The main collectibles include keys and score points, which lead to smaller and larger goals. \n   - **Keys:** Needed to unlock specific doors (small and large goals).\n   - **Goals:** There are two types of goals \u2014 small goals (green door) and large goals (gold door). Both have specific conditions for interaction.\n3. **Enemies and Combat:** There are different types of monsters with various cooldowns and spawn rates. The player can defeat these enemies to score points but also risks losing points if the avatar defeats the enemy.\n4. **Interactivity:** Certain interactions lead to transformations (like obtaining a key) or score changes (either gaining or losing points).\n5. **Walls and Obstacles:** The level features walls that restrict the avatar's movement but are immovable.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to collect keys and interact with doors to achieve win conditions, notably diminishing enemy threats and maximizing score.\n- The player wins when they successfully interact with enough small goals (with keys) or large goals, and they lose if the avatar is defeated.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** Achieved by accumulating all necessary sprites (small and large goals).\n- **Loss:** Occurs if the player (avatar) is defeated before accomplishing the objectives.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore Collectively:**\n   - Begin by exploring the level thoroughly to locate keys, small goals, and large goals. Understand the layout and note enemy patterns.\n\n2. **Prioritize Key Acquisition:**\n   - Focus on acquiring keys early in the game. Transform from 'nokey' to 'withkey' to unlock doors (especially the small green door).\n\n3. **Combat Wisely:**\n   - Engage enemies when necessary, but avoid unnecessary fights to minimize the risk of losing points. Use your sword strategically to defeat enemies for extra score but be aware of risks to your total score.\n\n4. **Utilize Goals Efficiently:**\n   - Interact with small goals first if you have keys to generate initial points. Plan to reach large goals when you are confident in your key status for maximum score gain.\n\n5. **Maintain Health and Points:**\n   - Always be aware of your score as defeating certain enemies can decrease it. Prioritize survival over aggression to maintain a good score.\n\n6. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Steer clear of walls and other immovable obstacles that may limit your mobility and ability to dodge enemies effectively.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can navigate the complexities of the game environment and work toward achieving victory through clever management of resources and tactical maneuvers against enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nkey sword -> 'n'\nwithkey -> 's'\nsmallgoal sword -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

The avatar currently holds a key.\n3. **Nearby Status:** To the left (10, 9) is a wall (w), below (11, 10) is a wall (w), and the positions up (9, 10) is also a wall (w). Therefore, the only available action is to move right (10, 11), where the large goal (#) is located.\n\n### Strategy Reminder:\n- The priority here is to utilize the 'withkey' status to approach the large goal since we have acquired the key.\n\nSince moving to the right would allow us to interact with the large goal, I will execute the action to move right.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis should successfully move towards the large goal and align with our strategy of maximizing score and progression. I expect to interact with the large goal on this move.",
