Players navigate through a structured environment, utilizing various mechanics and sprites to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites serve specific functions. For instance:\n   - **Avatar**: The player character that interacts with the environment.\n   - **Keys**: Necessary for unlocking doors.\n   - **Gems**: Collectibles that grant points based on color.\n   - **Boulders and walls**: Act as obstacles and may bounce the player back if an interaction occurs.\n   - **Exit**: The target point for completing a level.\n   \n2. **Interactions**: The game includes interactions between different sprites that determine how they behave. This can lead to transforming sprites, moving objects, or affecting scoring:\n   - Collecting keys turns the avatar into a \"keym\" missile.\n   - Interacting with colored gems results in different point penalties.\n   - The exit sprite gives a significant score upon completing the level.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate through the maze-like level, collect keys, collect gems (for points), and reach the exit. Players must manage their interactions carefully to achieve the best score and avoid unwanted outcomes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won by reaching the exit sprite (which results in a score increase).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is reduced to 0, indicating that it can no longer interact with the game world.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Path**: Before moving, assess the layout to identify the best routes to the exit while avoiding or managing obstacles.\n  \n2. **Key Management**: Prioritize collecting keys. They transition your avatar into a different state (keym), which is essential for overcoming obstacles like doors.\n  \n3. **Gem Strategy**: Weigh the benefits of collecting gems against the potential score loss. The red gem, for example, grants the most punitive score when collided with.\n  \n4. **Obstacle Navigation**: Pay attention to how boulders and walls interact with the avatar. Boulders can bounce the avatar back, so plan movements to minimize unintended consequences.\n  \n5. **Exit Focus**: Since reaching the exit gives a substantial score boost, make it your goal once you\u2019ve gathered enough resources and reduced risks from obstacles.\n\n6. **Optimize Score**: Balance gathering points from gems with the risk they pose. Consider whether collecting certain gems is worth the score penalty you might incur.\n\nBy managing resources effectively, avoiding harmful collisions, and planning movements strategically, you will increase your chances of successfully beating the level while maximizing your score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=0, col=13 -> d\nrow=0, col=14 -> d\nrow=0, col=15 -> d\nrow=0, col=16 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> &\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> d\nrow=1, col=11 -> d\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=13 -> d\nrow=1, col=14 -> d\nrow=1, col=15 -> d\nrow=1, col=16 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> d\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> d\nrow=2, col=15 -> d\nrow=2, col=16 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> d\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> d\nrow=3, col=15 -> d\nrow=3, col=16 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> d\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> d\nrow=4, col=16 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> d\nrow=5, col=11 -> d\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> d\nrow=5, col=15 -> d\nrow=5, col=16 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> d\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> a\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> #\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> d\nrow=8, col=2 -> d\nrow=8, col=3 -> d\nrow=8, col=4 -> d\nrow=8, col=5 -> d\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> d\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> d\nrow=8, col=10 -> d\nrow=8, col=11 -> d\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> d\nrow=8, col=15 -> d\nrow=8, col=16 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> d\nrow=9, col=2 -> d\nrow=9, col=3 -> d\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> d\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=13 -> d\nrow=9, col=14 -> d\nrow=9, col=15 -> d\nrow=9, col=16 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> d\nrow=10, col=2 -> d\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> d\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=13 -> d\nrow=10, col=14 -> d\nrow=10, col=15 -> d\nrow=10, col=16 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> @\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> @\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=13 -> d\nrow=11, col=14 -> d\nrow=11, col=15 -> d\nrow=11, col=16 -> d\nrow=12, col=0 -> d\nrow=12, col=1 -> d\nrow=12, col=2 -> d\nrow=12, col=3 -> d\nrow=12, col=4 -> d\nrow=12, col=5 -> d\nrow=12, col=6 -> d\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> d\nrow=12, col=9 -> d\nrow=12, col=10 -> d\nrow=12, col=11 -> d\nrow=12, col=12 -> d\nrow=12, col=13 -> d\nrow=12, col=14 -> d\nrow=12, col=15 -> d\nrow=12, col=16 -> d",

Collect keys or other beneficial items if possible.\n2. Move towards the exit at (row=4, col=14) while managing interactions effectively.\n\n### Strategy\n- The strategy suggests prioritizing collection and focusing on reaching the exit.\n- Since I am in the 'keym' state right now, I can interact with doors later to open them.\n- There\u2019s a key sprite (@) to the left at (row=7, col=1), which offers a great opportunity, as collecting it will not only increase my points but also might change my state.\n\n### Proposed Action\nThus, I will choose to move **LEFT** towards the key sprite. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis movement aims to collect the key sprite, enhancing my resources for future interactions while maintaining alignment with the overall strategy.",
