Collecting keys and gems contributes to the score:\n- Players must manage their interactions carefully to avoid being 'killed' by certain sprites or obstacles.\n- Successfully reaching the exit allows the player to win the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching and interacting with the exit sprite, which is indicated by a score change of +10.\n- **Loss Condition**: Losing occurs when the avatar's sprite count reaches 0, suggesting that if the avatar is eliminated (killed), the game ends.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Resource Management**: Prioritize collecting keys and gems while avoiding enemies (green, blue, and red gems) that can harm the avatar. \n   \n2. **Avoiding Obstacles**: Be cautious around walls and doors. Use boulders strategically to navigate or block paths rather than colliding with them directly.\n\n3. **Using Keys Effectively**: Collect keys to unlock doors. Since some doors can kill the avatar when interacting with a key missile, make sure to use keys wisely.\n\n4. **Navigating the Level**: Analyze the layout to find safe paths to collect items and reach the exit while minimizing encounters with dangerous sprites.\n\n5. **Calculate Scores**: Keep track of the score changes associated with each action (e.g., killing sprites or reaching the exit) to gauge your progress and determine if pursuing certain paths is worthwhile.\n\n6. **Boulder Gameplay**: Use boulders to create barriers or opportunities to push or manipulate other items without triggering death interactions.\n\n7. **Plan Actions**: Think ahead before making moves; predict the outcomes of interactions to avoid negative consequences.\n\nConsidering the interactions, layout, and objectives, adopting a strategic and cautious approach will maximize chances of successfully navigating through the level and securing a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=0, col=13 -> d\nrow=0, col=14 -> d\nrow=0, col=15 -> d\nrow=0, col=16 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> &\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> d\nrow=1, col=11 -> d\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=13 -> d\nrow=1, col=14 -> d\nrow=1, col=15 -> d\nrow=1, col=16 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> d\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> d\nrow=2, col=15 -> d\nrow=2, col=16 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> d\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> d\nrow=3, col=15 -> d\nrow=3, col=16 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> d\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> d\nrow=4, col=16 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> d\nrow=5, col=11 -> d\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> d\nrow=5, col=15 -> d\nrow=5, col=16 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> d\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> d\nrow=8, col=2 -> d\nrow=8, col=3 -> d\nrow=8, col=4 -> d\nrow=8, col=5 -> d\nrow=8, col=6 -> c\nrow=8, col=7 -> d\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> d\nrow=8, col=10 -> d\nrow=8, col=11 -> d\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> d\nrow=8, col=15 -> d\nrow=8, col=16 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> d\nrow=9, col=2 -> d\nrow=9, col=3 -> d\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> d\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=13 -> d\nrow=9, col=14 -> d\nrow=9, col=15 -> d\nrow=9, col=16 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> d\nrow=10, col=2 -> d\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> d\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=13 -> d\nrow=10, col=14 -> d\nrow=10, col=15 -> d\nrow=10, col=16 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> @\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> @\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=13 -> d\nrow=11, col=14 -> d\nrow=11, col=15 -> d\nrow=11, col=16 -> d\nrow=12, col=0 -> d\nrow=12, col=1 -> d\nrow=12, col=2 -> d\nrow=12, col=3 -> d\nrow=12, col=4 -> d\nrow=12, col=5 -> d\nrow=12, col=6 -> d\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> d\nrow=12, col=9 -> d\nrow=12, col=10 -> d\nrow=12, col=11 -> d\nrow=12, col=12 -> d\nrow=12, col=13 -> d\nrow=12, col=14 -> d\nrow=12, col=15 -> d\nrow=12, col=16 -> d",

Collect keys and avoid dangers (enemies may appear above).\n2. Move towards the exit (row 4, col 14), which is relatively far.\n3. Focus on optimizing the path towards the exit through safe spaces.\n\n### Next Action Decision:\n- Moving \"UP\" to (row 6, col 7) will not lead directly to the exit but keeps paths open.
