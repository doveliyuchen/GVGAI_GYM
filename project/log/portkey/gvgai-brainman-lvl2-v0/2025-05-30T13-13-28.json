Players must navigate through a level, solving puzzles, while avoiding hazards and collecting items.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game includes various sprites with specific functions, such as walls, doors, keys, gems, and the player's avatar. Each has its own behavior and interactions.\n- **Interactions:** The game features a rich interaction system where objects can transform, bounce, or eliminate the avatar based on certain conditions.\n  - Collecting keys and using them to unlock doors is a critical mechanic.\n  - Gems and colored objects have detrimental effects on the avatar, which must be avoided.\n  - The boulder can bounce off the avatar, potentially changing the course of the game.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal is to navigate the level and reach the exit. The exit is a critical sprite that changes the game state when reached, contributing to the victory condition. Additionally, the player should aim to collect points by interacting with certain sprites (gems, keys).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the avatar successfully reaches the exit sprite, which counts towards a score.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0), meaning they can no longer navigate or interact with the level.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Start by thoroughly surveying the layout of the level. Identify critical paths, obstacles, and the locations of the exit, keys, and gems.\n\n2. **Resource Management:** Collect keys with caution. Since the avatar can transform into a key missile (keym), be strategic about when and where to use them. Avoid unnecessary transformations that don\u2019t benefit your progress.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Stay clear of the destructive gems (green, blue, red) since they have the potential to eliminate the avatar. Plan your movements carefully to dodge these threats.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulders:** Use boulders to your advantage. If possible, guide the boulder to knock other sprites out of the way or clear a path for your avatar.\n\n5. **Unlocking Doors:** Prioritize collecting keys to unlock doors. Make sure you have the correct key (keym) available before attempting interactions with doors to prevent losing the avatar.\n\n6. **Scoring and Progression:** While reaching the exit is vital, collecting points through gems can potentially grant additional benefits or serve the underlying gameplay score mechanics.\n\n7. **Trial and Error:** If stuck, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different interactions. The undo mechanics indicate a potentially forgiving system that allows for exploratory strategies.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating through the level and completing the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=0, col=13 -> d\nrow=0, col=14 -> d\nrow=0, col=15 -> d\nrow=0, col=16 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> &\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> d\nrow=1, col=11 -> d\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=13 -> d\nrow=1, col=14 -> d\nrow=1, col=15 -> d\nrow=1, col=16 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> d\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> d\nrow=2, col=15 -> d\nrow=2, col=16 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> d\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> d\nrow=3, col=15 -> d\nrow=3, col=16 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> d\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> d\nrow=4, col=16 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> d\nrow=5, col=11 -> d\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> d\nrow=5, col=15 -> d\nrow=5, col=16 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> d\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> #\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> d\nrow=8, col=2 -> d\nrow=8, col=3 -> d\nrow=8, col=4 -> d\nrow=8, col=5 -> d\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> d\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> d\nrow=8, col=10 -> d\nrow=8, col=11 -> d\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> d\nrow=8, col=15 -> d\nrow=8, col=16 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> d\nrow=9, col=2 -> d\nrow=9, col=3 -> d\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> d\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=13 -> d\nrow=9, col=14 -> d\nrow=9, col=15 -> d\nrow=9, col=16 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> d\nrow=10, col=2 -> d\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> d\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=13 -> d\nrow=10, col=14 -> d\nrow=10, col=15 -> d\nrow=10, col=16 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> @\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> @\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=13 -> d\nrow=11, col=14 -> d\nrow=11, col=15 -> d\nrow=11, col=16 -> d\nrow=12, col=0 -> d\nrow=12, col=1 -> d\nrow=12, col=2 -> d\nrow=12, col=3 -> d\nrow=12, col=4 -> d\nrow=12, col=5 -> d\nrow=12, col=6 -> d\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> d\nrow=12, col=9 -> d\nrow=12, col=10 -> d\nrow=12, col=11 -> d\nrow=12, col=12 -> d\nrow=12, col=13 -> d\nrow=12, col=14 -> d\nrow=12, col=15 -> d\nrow=12, col=16 -> d",

The next logical action is to examine the available directions carefully and determine the safest, most beneficial direction to advance towards collecting keys or approaching the exit while avoiding hazards.\n\nThe closest key ('*') is located at row 1, column 6. To access it, I could use the 'UP' action to move upward. However, I also need to consider the immediate threats posed by gems on the path.\n\nGiven the current context, I should first check if the initial direction might be problematic. The suggested action is to **move left first** to assess any threats directly.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this move will allow me to reassess the environment further, avoiding any hazards while potentially putting me closer to an advantageous position for future strategic moves.",
