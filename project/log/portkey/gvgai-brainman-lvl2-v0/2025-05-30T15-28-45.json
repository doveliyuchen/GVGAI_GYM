    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer** genre where players navigate through a grid-like environment, solving puzzles to progress and achieve specific objectives while interacting with various sprites.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- The game utilizes a grid layout filled with different sprites including the player avatar, collectible gems, keys, doors, and obstacles.\n- Players can interact with objects in the environment, such as:\n  - Collecting **keys** (turning them into lethal or regular form depending on the situation).\n  - Moving boulders and interacting with walls and doors.\n  - The **avatar** can collect gems of different colors that have different point values.\n- The main mechanics include transformation, collision (bounce effects), attraction, and score alteration depending on interactions.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary goal is to navigate through the level, collect keys and gems, and safely reach the **exit**.\n- Points can be accumulated by collecting gems (1-5 points), while reaching the exit grants a significant score boost (10 points).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game is won when all exits are reached, leading to the termination of the avatar (indicated by `win=True`).\n- The game is lost when the avatar is eliminated (indicated by `win=False`).\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Prioritize Collecting Keys:**\n   - Focus on obtaining the keys as they are necessary to open doors and interact with other sprites. Use the keys to unlock potential areas that may contain valuable gems or the exit.\n\n2. **Gem Collection:**\n   - Collect gems while being cautious about the colors. Red gems grant the most points, followed by blue and green. However, prioritize your safety; avoid being hit by gems and enemies (represented by interactions with the avatar) that can eliminate you.\n\n3. **Boulder Movement:**\n   - Use boulders strategically to bounce off obstacles and clear pathways. This can create more space for maneuvering and accessing keys or gems.\n\n4. **Navigating Obstacles and Walls:**\n   - Plan movements carefully around walls and doors. Use the correct key type to access locked doors. The keym can be quite lethal to enemies, use that to your advantage if you have it.\n\n5. **Avoid Dangers:**\n   - Avoid collecting the green sprite at all costs, as it leads to losing points, and be on the lookout for other hazardous interactions.\n\n6. **Exit Planning:**\n   - Once enough points have been secured, and you have the necessary keys, make your way to the exit. Ensure you have a path clear of any threats and can safely reach it without being eliminated.\n\nBy following this strategic approach, you can maximize your score while reaching the exit, ensuring victory in the puzzle-platform environment of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=0, col=13 -> d\nrow=0, col=14 -> d\nrow=0, col=15 -> d\nrow=0, col=16 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> &\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> d\nrow=1, col=11 -> d\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=13 -> d\nrow=1, col=14 -> d\nrow=1, col=15 -> d\nrow=1, col=16 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> a\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> d\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> d\nrow=2, col=15 -> d\nrow=2, col=16 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> d\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> d\nrow=3, col=15 -> d\nrow=3, col=16 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> d\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> d\nrow=4, col=16 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> d\nrow=5, col=11 -> d\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> d\nrow=5, col=15 -> d\nrow=5, col=16 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> d\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> d\nrow=8, col=2 -> d\nrow=8, col=3 -> d\nrow=8, col=4 -> d\nrow=8, col=5 -> d\nrow=8, col=6 -> c\nrow=8, col=7 -> d\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> d\nrow=8, col=10 -> d\nrow=8, col=11 -> d\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> d\nrow=8, col=15 -> d\nrow=8, col=16 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> d\nrow=9, col=2 -> d\nrow=9, col=3 -> d\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> d\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=13 -> d\nrow=9, col=14 -> d\nrow=9, col=15 -> d\nrow=9, col=16 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> d\nrow=10, col=2 -> d\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> d\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=13 -> d\nrow=10, col=14 -> d\nrow=10, col=15 -> d\nrow=10, col=16 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> @\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> @\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=13 -> d\nrow=11, col=14 -> d\nrow=11, col=15 -> d\nrow=11, col=16 -> d\nrow=12, col=0 -> d\nrow=12, col=1 -> d\nrow=12, col=2 -> d\nrow=12, col=3 -> d\nrow=12, col=4 -> d\nrow=12, col=5 -> d\nrow=12, col=6 -> d\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> d\nrow=12, col=9 -> d\nrow=12, col=10 -> d\nrow=12, col=11 -> d\nrow=12, col=12 -> d\nrow=12, col=13 -> d\nrow=12, col=14 -> d\nrow=12, col=15 -> d\nrow=12, col=16 -> d",
