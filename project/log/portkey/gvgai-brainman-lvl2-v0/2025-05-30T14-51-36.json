Players navigate through a maze-like environment, solving puzzles using the items they collect while avoiding or overcoming obstacles.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** There are various sprites, including the avatar (the player character), keys, doors, gems (colored for point values), walls, boulders, and an exit.\n2. **Interactions:** \n   - The avatar can pick up keys, which can change to a different type (keym) upon retrieval.\n   - Collecting gems grants points, with different colors providing varying amounts (green = 1, blue = 2, red = 5).\n   - The avatar's interactions with walls and boulders can either result in bouncing off or stepping back.\n   - Keys and doors can potentially lead to the avatar's demise if the right conditions aren\u2019t met.\n   - The exit can be reached for a significant score bonus.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the exit sprite while maximizing the score by collecting gems. The player must also avoid being killed by certain interactions (e.g., colliding with green, blue, or red gems).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the exit sprite is reached, which also awards points.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Familiarization:** Understanding the layout and the location of walls, doors, keys, gems, and the exit is crucial. Mapping out potential routes and hazards will help in planning your moves effectively.\n  \n2. **Collect Keys Wisely:** Prioritize collecting keys to open doors. Be cautious of interactions between keys and other game elements to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n3. **Maximize Gem Collection:** Aim to collect as many gems as possible while carefully managing how you interact with them. Focus on collecting red gems first since they yield the highest point values.\n\n4. **Plan Moves Thoughtfully:** Use boulders and walls strategically. The boulder can be a useful tool for bouncing off walls to avoid green, blue, and red gems that can result in a loss.\n\n5. **Use Key Transformations:** Monitor your inventory of keys and keep track of which types you have. Switching between key types may help you navigate through certain obstacles more effectively.\n\n6. **Approach the Exit Carefully:** Once you've accumulated a good number of points, start planning your approach to the exit. Ensure that there are no unavoidable deaths lurking in the path. \n\n7. **Avoid Risky Interactions:** Steer clear of areas where green, blue, and red gems are clustered unless you\u2019re confident in your ability to maneuver without dying.\n\nBy employing these strategies and tactics, players can efficiently navigate the level, maximize their score, and reach the exit successfully, ensuring both victory in the game and a higher cumulative score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=0, col=13 -> d\nrow=0, col=14 -> d\nrow=0, col=15 -> d\nrow=0, col=16 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> &\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> d\nrow=1, col=11 -> d\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=13 -> d\nrow=1, col=14 -> d\nrow=1, col=15 -> d\nrow=1, col=16 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> d\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> d\nrow=2, col=15 -> d\nrow=2, col=16 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> d\nrow=3, col=11 -> &\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> d\nrow=3, col=15 -> d\nrow=3, col=16 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> d\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> d\nrow=4, col=16 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> d\nrow=5, col=11 -> d\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> d\nrow=5, col=15 -> d\nrow=5, col=16 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> d\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> a\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> c\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> &\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> d\nrow=8, col=2 -> d\nrow=8, col=3 -> d\nrow=8, col=4 -> d\nrow=8, col=5 -> d\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> d\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> d\nrow=8, col=10 -> d\nrow=8, col=11 -> d\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> d\nrow=8, col=15 -> d\nrow=8, col=16 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> d\nrow=9, col=2 -> d\nrow=9, col=3 -> d\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> d\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=13 -> d\nrow=9, col=14 -> d\nrow=9, col=15 -> d\nrow=9, col=16 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> d\nrow=10, col=2 -> d\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> d\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=13 -> d\nrow=10, col=14 -> d\nrow=10, col=15 -> d\nrow=10, col=16 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> @\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> @\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=13 -> d\nrow=11, col=14 -> d\nrow=11, col=15 -> d\nrow=11, col=16 -> d\nrow=12, col=0 -> d\nrow=12, col=1 -> d\nrow=12, col=2 -> d\nrow=12, col=3 -> d\nrow=12, col=4 -> d\nrow=12, col=5 -> d\nrow=12, col=6 -> d\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> d\nrow=12, col=9 -> d\nrow=12, col=10 -> d\nrow=12, col=11 -> d\nrow=12, col=12 -> d\nrow=12, col=13 -> d\nrow=12, col=14 -> d\nrow=12, col=15 -> d\nrow=12, col=16 -> d",
