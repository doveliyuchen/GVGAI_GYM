The player controls an avatar (submarine) that interacts with various aquatic sprites, including enemies and resources, in a dynamic underwater environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- The player controls a submarine (the avatar) that can shoot torpedoes to interact with other sprites.\n- There are multiple enemy types: sharks that chase the player, and whales and piranhas that can attack.\n- The player collects resources (shells and shark fangs) for points and possibly for upgrades.\n- The game has a timing mechanism with a timeout limit, indicating the need for the player to accomplish certain tasks within a set time frame.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to survive by managing the resources acquired while defeating enemies. The player shoots torpedoes to eliminate fish and collect resources while avoiding being killed by sharks. The player must also collect enough resources to spawn additional shark fangs, which may be linked to survival or score.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- The game is won if the player successfully navigates the environment and survives until the timeout limit of 1000 is reached (thus winning via survival).\n- The game is lost if the player's avatar is destroyed (limited by sprite counter condition reaching zero).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Resource Management:** Focus on collecting shells and shark fangs for maximum score. Avoid unnecessary confrontations unless you're sure you can win.\n  \n2. **Evading Sharks:** Since sharks are chasers, maneuver your submarine strategically to avoid encounters. Always keep an eye on their movements.\n\n3. **Utilize Torpedoes Wisely:** Use torpedoes to eliminate fish, which grants you score and resources. Manage your shots so as not to waste these on enemies that may be unnecessary confrontations.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning:** Keep an eye on the timer and prioritize your movements and resource collection to ensure you can survive till the end. Make sure to avoid areas where you might get cornered by multiple enemies.\n\n5. **Engage Selectively:** Engage with enemies when you have advantageous positions or when collecting resources; avoid conflicts when you're low on resources, as losing would cause game over.\n\nBy balancing aggression against enemies while maximizing resource collection within the time limit, players can navigate this aquatic setting effectively and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater piranhahole -> '1'\nwater whalehole -> '2'\nwater sharkhole -> '3'\nwater -> '.'\nshark water -> '@'\nwater whale whalehole -> '#'\nwater whale -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=0, col=16 -> .\nrow=0, col=17 -> .\nrow=0, col=18 -> .\nrow=0, col=19 -> .\nrow=0, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> 2\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> .\nrow=2, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=0 -> 2\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> 2\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> .\nrow=4, col=20 -> .\nrow=5, col=0 -> 2\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> 2\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> .\nrow=6, col=20 -> .\nrow=7, col=0 -> 2\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> .\nrow=7, col=20 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> .\nrow=8, col=19 -> .\nrow=8, col=20 -> .",

Below me in row 7, there are sharkholes ('@'), which indicates that if I stay here too long, I may attract their attention, especially since sharks chase the player.\n\nHere are the available actions I can take:\n1. Move **UP** to (7, 2) \u2013 which has a whale ('$') that I could collect.\n2. Action **NIL** does not help advance my situation.\n3. Move **DOWN** will put me back to (8, 2), and no change will occur.\n4. Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** would also lead me into open water, with no resource nearby.\n\nConsidering my strategy of maximizing resource collection and the immediate threat posed by sharks, the best action here is to move **UP** to collect the whale at (7, 2).\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action aligns well with the strategy of resource collection and avoiding sharks.
