If you create more than one wrong placement, the game is lost.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Ingredient Pairings:**\n   - Identify the necessary items to create \"plateinplace\" (i.e., raw pasta + sauceinplace).\n   - The key ingredient pairings are:\n     - Combine tomato + tuna to create sauceinplace.\n     - Combine raw pasta with boiling water to create pastainplace.\n     - Combine pastainplace with sauceinplace to get plateinplace.\n\n2. **Minimize Wrong Combinations:**\n   - Focus on avoiding interactions that yield \"wrongplace\" as these negatively impact your score and can lead to losing the game.\n   - Be cautious when collecting ingredients to ensure they are combined correctly.\n\n3. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize collecting the key early to unlock the lock and ensure you have the ability to continue progressing.\n   - Be mindful of space and movement, as the avatar cannot move freely into walls.\n\n4. **Experiment with Ingredient Locations:**\n   - Since some ingredients or cooking tools are immovable (like boiling water), make sure you utilize all available locations strategically. \n   - Avoid keeping ingredients together if they lead to an unwanted interaction.\n\n5. **Iterative Learning:**\n   - If you make a mistake, learn from it and adapt your strategy. Understand the combination rules to improve efficiency and reduce errors.\n\nBy carefully planning your actions, recognizing what items to combine, and managing your resources effectively, you can navigate through the levels successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nrawpasta -> '#'\ntomato -> '$'\ntuna -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> a\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> &\nrow=10, col=3 -> &\nrow=10, col=4 -> &\nrow=10, col=5 -> &\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> &\nrow=10, col=8 -> &\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=10 -> &\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> &\nrow=10, col=13 -> &",

To proceed effectively and align with the overall strategy, the next steps need to clear a path towards acquiring the necessary ingredients for making the pasta dish.\n\nIn this situation, directly adjacent to the avatar at (row=8, col=9) is 'b', which is boiling water, and at (row=8, col=10) is 't', which is tuna. To make progress, I should focus on interacting with the ingredients to begin the dish preparation.\n\nSince the avatar can move right towards the boiling water, I will take that action. This move will allow me to collect the boiling water, which is critical for cooking the raw pasta later.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar right to collect boiling water, setting up for the next combination needed in the cooking process.",
