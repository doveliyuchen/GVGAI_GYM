The win condition is achieved when the player creates a 'plateinplace'.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully create a 'plateinplace' which counts towards victory.\n- **Loss Condition:** Creating a 'wrongplace' state triggers penalties, and reaching a limit of wrong combinations results in loss.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Combos:** Familiarize yourself with the correct ingredient combinations and the ones that yield penalties. Prioritize combinations that lead to 'plateinplace'.\n  \n2. **Resource Management:** Key collection allows the opening of locks which are necessary for progressing through levels. Ensure to collect the key before interacting with locks.\n\n3. **Plan Your Moves:** Given the penalties from wrong combinations, carefully plan how to combine ingredients. Prioritize using boiling water with raw pasta before mixing other ingredients to avoid wrong placements. \n\n4. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities:** Each successful item combination not only leads to the final dish but also awards points. Aim for high-scoring combinations like the transformation from 'pastainplace' and 'sauceinplace' to 'plateinplace'.\n\n5. **Avoid Dead Ends:** Be cautious of situations that could lead to having a 'wrongplace' item, as reaching the limit of these will end the game. \n\n6. **Traversal Awareness:** Use the avatar effectively to navigate the level, keeping a keen eye on both resource status (like the key) and the spatial arrangement of items.\n\nBy following these strategies, you will optimize your chances of creating the desired dishes and scoring points, moving towards a successful completion of each level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nrawpasta -> '#'\ntomato -> '$'\ntuna -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\npastainplace -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> &\nrow=10, col=3 -> &\nrow=10, col=4 -> &\nrow=10, col=5 -> &\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> &\nrow=10, col=8 -> &\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=10 -> &\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> &\nrow=10, col=13 -> &",

Since my current position does not change after attempting to move in any direction, it's crucial to choose a meaningful action.\n\nGiven that I have a clear path to the surrounding floor, I\u2019ll choose to move to an adjacent empty space. The safest option is to move **Left (to 9, 1)**. This will allow for better positioning to explore the game further.\n\nThus, the action I will take is:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will help in reevaluating the options for future moves while avoiding any potential wrong placements, aligning with our strategy of careful planning.",
