Players must use their problem-solving skills to combine ingredients and create dishes while avoiding errors.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites and Actions:** \n  - The game features an 'avatar' (a chef character) that the player controls. \n  - Various sprites represent ingredients, cooking processes, and obstacles (e.g., walls, keys, locks).\n  - Interactions involve combining ingredients (like raw pasta, tomato, and tuna) and cooking them in boiling water to create finished dishes or to transform them into 'wrongplace' items that score negative points.\n  \n- **Transformation:** \n  - Raw ingredients can transform into different states based on how they are combined, with some combinations leading to points (e.g., correctly combining ingredients to create dishes) and others leading to penalties (e.g., incorrect combinations).\n\n- **Resource Management:** \n  - Players need to collect a key to open a lock, which suggests a strategic collection and usage of resources.\n\n- **Score System:** \n  - The player's score can increase by successfully combining ingredients (like pasta with sauce) or collecting the key, while incorrect combinations lead to score decrease and potential failure.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The main objective is to create a dish (represented by the 'plateinplace' sprite) through the correct combination of ingredients and cooking techniques while ensuring that the player does not create any incorrect combinations that would lead to a loss condition.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Condition:** Successfully create a 'plateinplace' dish.\n- **Losing Condition:** Creating a 'wrongplace' item (the limit for this is set to 1). If the player creates one wrong combination, they automatically lose.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Ingredient Familiarity:** Familiarize yourself with all ingredient combinations and the transformations they lead to\u2014this is key to avoiding 'wrongplace' outcomes.\n\n2. **Plan Your Moves:** Since there is a risk of immediate failure with one wrong combination, think ahead about your moves and try to visualize possible interactions before executing them.\n\n3. **Resource Collection:** Prioritize finding the key, as it is essential for advancing past the lock and might open up new opportunities for completing your dish.\n\n4. **Sequential Cooking:** Start with the basic ingredients (like the raw pasta) and work your way to combinations gradually. Make sure to use boiling water as your next step for the pasta\u2014doing this at the right time will significantly increase your chances of creating a 'pastainplace' successfully.\n\n5. **Save Spaces for Combinations:** Pay attention to your spatial layout within the level. Ensure you have enough room to maneuver around and combine ingredients\u2014especially since the walls can limit movement.\n\n6. **Experiment, But Be Cautious:** While experimentation can lead to discovering new combinations, always maintain caution to not rush into combinations that may lead to penalties.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the game rules thoroughly, players can effectively progress toward their objectives without falling into traps that lead to failure.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nrawpasta -> '#'\ntomato -> '$'\ntuna -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> a\nrow=4, col=12 -> $\nrow=4, col=13 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> &\nrow=10, col=3 -> &\nrow=10, col=4 -> &\nrow=10, col=5 -> &\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> &\nrow=10, col=8 -> &\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=10 -> &\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> &\nrow=10, col=13 -> &",
