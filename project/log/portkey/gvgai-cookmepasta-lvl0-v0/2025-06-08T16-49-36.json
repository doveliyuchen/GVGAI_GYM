The key interactions leading to successful dish creation must be prioritized.\n   - Avoid combinations that lead to `wrongplace` sprites, as each wrong action can diminish your chances of winning.\n\n2. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Map out a route through the level to gather the necessary ingredients without colliding with walls or falling into wrong combinations.\n   - Use the key strategically to unlock the lock, as obtaining it opens new pathways to progress.\n\n3. **Prioritize Cooking Steps:**\n   - Focus first on getting the raw pasta into boiling water since this transformation is essential to create the base of your dish.\n   - Then, aim to pair the cooked pasta correctly with other ingredients (like sauce) for a successful plate.\n\n4. **Minimize Mistakes:**\n   - Carefully consider each action before executing it. Errors can lead to penalties that might prevent you from creating the winning dish.\n\n5. **Resource Management:**\n   - Keep track of your items, particularly the key. Ensure you collect it before trying to unlock the area to avoid setbacks.\n   \n6. **Adapt to Environment:**\n   - Be aware of the wall obstacles and plan your movements to avoid backtracking unnecessarily, which can waste time and actions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the gameplay mechanics, reduce chances of loss, and enhance their probability of creating the desired 'plateinplace' to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nrawpasta -> '#'\ntomato -> '$'\ntuna -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\npastainplace -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> a\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> &\nrow=10, col=3 -> &\nrow=10, col=4 -> &\nrow=10, col=5 -> &\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> &\nrow=10, col=8 -> &\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=10 -> &\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> &\nrow=10, col=13 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, the avatar 'a' is located at (9, 10) and there is a tuna sprite '%' located at (9, 12). The goal is to create a plate of pasta ('*'), while avoiding any wrong combinations that would lead to penalties.\n\n### Evaluation of Current Position:\n- The avatar is next to a wall on the left and below.\n- The tuna is directly to the right of the avatar (9, 12). \n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Collecting Tuna**: Moving right to (9, 11) will allow the avatar to interact with the tuna located at (9, 12).\n2. **Assessing Wrong Combinations**: Since there\u2019s no boiling water or pasta in the immediate vicinity, this action should be considered primarily for resource collection.\n\nBased on the strategic advice given:\n- The player needs to gather ingredients correctly and avoid penalties.\n- Since moving right potentially allows the avatar to collect the tuna for further recipes, this action aligns with our objective to create dishes.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is aimed at collecting the tuna, which is deemed essential for creating a successful dish. I expect that this will guide me one step closer to assembling my plate of pasta.",
