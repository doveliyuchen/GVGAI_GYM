    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to fall into the puzzle strategy genre, featuring elements of spatial reasoning and interactive mechanics to solve challenges within a confined space.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various types of sprites represent the game elements, including immovable walls, floor tiles, and the avatar (player character).\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can move and interact with the blocks and boxes. \n  - Certain interactions transform boxes into specific colored blocks, which can then be used to score points.\n  - The presence of special blocks (blue, red, green) suggests the potential for combination and strategic placement.\n  - The hole sprite acts as a hazard that can end the game if the avatar falls into it.\n  - Moving the boxes strategically allows players to either eliminate obstacles or create pathways.\n  \n**Objective:**\n- The main objective is to successfully eliminate all box sprites (by transforming them into broken boxes or using their transformation ability) before the avatar is eliminated or the time runs out.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - All boxes must be removed from the level (transformed into broken boxes).\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar's count reaches zero (meaning the avatar has been eliminated).\n  - A broken box count reaches one, which may indicate a critical failure or point in the game.\n  - A timeout occurs, meaning the player did not complete the stage within the allocated time.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Understand Interactions:** Familiarize yourself with how boxes interact with each other and the types of blocks. Use these interactions to your advantage to convert boxes into points.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Box Movement:** Focus on moving boxes to areas where they can be easily transformed into colored blocks. This might involve strategic bouncing to create openings.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Be careful not to step into holes or allow too many interactions with walls that may cause you to bounce back into obstacles or hazards.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:** Given the time limit and the need to eliminate all boxes, plan your moves ahead of time. Use the limited space effectively to ensure you can reach all boxes in time.\n\n5. **Use the Environment:** Use walls and floor sprites strategically to channel box movement or to create barriers between the avatar and the holes.\n\n6. **Stay Flexible:** Be ready to adapt your strategy as the blocks transform or the situation changes during gameplay, as the interaction mechanics can lead to life or death situations quickly.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics and objectives clearly and employing a thoughtful strategy focused on interaction and movement, players can maximize their chance of completing levels successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
