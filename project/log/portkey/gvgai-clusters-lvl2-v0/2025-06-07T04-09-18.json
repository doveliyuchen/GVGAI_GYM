The player controls an avatar that moves around a grid-based layout, solving puzzles based on the interactions between various types of blocks and obstacles.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game utilizes different types of sprites (tiles) including floor, holes, blocks, and boxes. The avatar moves around the grid and interacts with these sprites in specific ways.\n- **Movement and Interaction**: The avatar can step back when hitting walls or blocks, bounce off boxes, and transform between different block styles. The interactions imply a need for strategic movement to solve puzzles.\n- **Box and Block Transformation**: There are specific interactions where certain boxes can convert to colored blocks, which presumably play a role in solving the overarching puzzle.\n- **Scoring**: Interacting successfully with blue, red, and green blocks increases the score, while interacting with a hole causes a score decrease.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be to eliminate all boxes (sprite limitation) from the level while managing the transformations and interactions in a way that prevents the player from losing their avatar or time.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by managing to remove all boxes (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (typically by falling into holes) or if the time runs out.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Understand the Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, and blocks. Identify paths that allow movement without falling into dangers.\n2. **Plan Movements**: Since the avatar can bounce off boxes but can only step back from walls and blocks, use bouncing to manipulate box placements strategically.\n3. **Use Transformations Wisely**: Make sure to trigger transformations of boxes into blocks to maximize your score and clear the level. Aim to work with the colored blocks to streamline your path and minimize obstacles.\n4. **Manage Time**: Always keep an eye on the timer; there's a limit to the number of moves you can make. Ideally, map out the most efficient route to eliminate all boxes quickly.\n5. **Avoid Holes**: Be cautious around holes as falling into one results in the avatar\u2019s loss. Prioritize clearing out nearby boxes and blocks before working your way toward potential risks.\n\nBy understanding the rules, objectives, and planned strategies, players can effectively navigate and solve puzzles throughout the game, ultimately achieving the necessary goal of removing all boxes and progressing through levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

The immediate surrounding environment consists of several types of blocks and a hole.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- To the **left (6, 7)**, there is a floor tile (path).\n- To the **right (6, 9)**, there is a blue box ('#').\n- Above (5, 8) is open ground with a hole below (5, 5) and above, but no immediate risk of falling.\n- Below (7, 8) is an open space.\n  \nGiven the surrounding layout, moving left will not trap the avatar as there are no immediate threats. The goal seems to be to manipulate the blue box ('#').\n\n### Strategy:\nFrom the current position, moving left or interacting with the blue box is a priority. The best move here is **to the left (6, 7)** to position myself better for the next actions, potentially setting up to interact with the box in the next turn.\n\n### Action:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to align with the strategy of exploring the surroundings and positioning for further interactions/actions.",
