    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** game. The inclusion of immovable sprites, environmental interactions, and the avatar's movement mechanics suggests a focus on problem-solving and spatial reasoning, typical of this genre.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Elements**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character (a knight) that moves through the level.\n   - **Blocks**: Various types of blocks (blue, red, green) that can interact in different ways when combined or moved by the avatar.\n   - **Boxes**: A special passive sprite that can transform or bounce when interacted with.\n   - **Walls and Holes**: Impassable barriers and pitfalls that lead to losing the game if the avatar falls into them.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, allowing for strategic movement across the level.\n   - Certain box-block combinations lead to transformations that score points.\n   - Misplacing blocks (such as pushing them into the hole) or running into walls causes setbacks.\n\n3. **Scoring**:\n   - Points are gained by transforming boxes into blocks.\n   - Points are deducted when the avatar falls into holes.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to eliminate all boxes to achieve a win state indicated by the specific sprite counter reaching zero.\n- The player must avoid running out of the avatar sprites, ensure the avatar remains alive, and prevent boxes from transforming into 'broken boxes' or falling into holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if the sprite counter for the boxes reaches zero.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar sprite counter reaches zero (the avatar is 'killed').\n  - A 'broken box' sprite counter reaches one (indicating a transformation into an undesirable state).\n  - A timeout occurs after 1500 moves or actions are performed, signifying a lack of progress.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Moves**: Before making a move, consider how each action affects the positioning of blocks and the potential for transforming boxes. \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of holes and walls that can kill the avatar, focusing instead on strategic placements of boxes and blocks.\n3. **Utilize Bouncing**: Use the bouncing mechanic of boxes to reposition blocks effectively without falling into traps or being pushed against walls.\n4. **Coordinate Transformations**: Aim to create combinations of blue, red, and green boxes with their respective block counterparts to maximize points and minimize remaining boxes on the field.\n5. **Efficient Movement**: Because of the time limit, aim to make movements that optimize the number of boxes transformed per action while avoiding indirect consequences that may lead to losing the avatar or boxes.\n\nBy focusing on careful planning, avoiding pitfalls, and strategically utilizing block interactions, players can navigate this puzzle-platformer effectively to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
