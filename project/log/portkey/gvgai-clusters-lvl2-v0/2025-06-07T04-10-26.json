Players control an avatar (a moving character) who needs to interact with various block types and complete the puzzle by collecting or managing resources such as boxes in a fixed environment.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** Includes walls and floors that cannot be changed, serving as boundaries for the play area.\n   - **Interactable Objects:** There are various types of boxes (blue, red, green), each with specific behavior when interacting with the avatar or other boxes.\n   - **Passive Objects:** The \"box\" sprite can bounce the avatar forward.\n   - **Death/Hazards:** Encountering a \"hole\" sprite results in the avatar\u2019s loss.\n   - **Transformations:** Certain boxes can transform into blocks when they interact with matches (e.g., blue box with blue block).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes and needs to avoid holes which will end the game.\n   - Blocks can be transformed into their respective colors upon certain interactions, contributing to scoring points.\n   - There are undo mechanisms that come into play when multiple types of boxes interact together or get pushed against walls.\n\n3. **Goal:**\n   - The primary objective is to eliminate all boxes (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`), while managing to not encounter hazards or run out of lives/avatars.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe player's goal is to maneuver the avatar to transform boxes into scoring elements while avoiding losing lives from hazards. Successfully eliminating all boxes wins the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** All boxes eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0`).\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - If the avatar's count reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n  - If a broken box appears (`MultiSpriteCounter stype1=brokenBox limit=1 win=False`).\n  - If time runs out (timeout after 1500 moves) (`Timeout limit=1500 win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movement:**\n   - Carefully plan the avatar's moves to avoid walls and holes. Each interaction should be calculated to ensure the avatar doesn\u2019t encounter death risks.\n\n2. **Manage Box Interactions:**\n   - Focus on interacting with blue, red, and green boxes strategically\u2014know which boxes can be transformed into corresponding blocks for points, while also considering that interacting groups may undo each other.\n   - Use the bouncing effect of the original boxes to push them appropriately without risking losing boxes in the process.\n\n3. **Control the Environment:**\n   - Pay attention to the layout of the level. Moving towards walls should be avoided unless it\u2019s necessary to bounce boxes into place.\n\n4. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on your moves; there\u2019s a limit of 1500 moves before losing. Prioritize eliminating boxes quickly to avoid running out of moves.\n\n5. **Evaluate Risks:**\n   - Always evaluate the position of boxes in relation to the holes and ensure your avatar can safely navigate towards the goal without entering a risky area.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies and understanding the game mechanics fully, you can effectively progress through the levels while minimizing risks and optimizing your moves.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To determine the correct action based on the current state of the game, let's analyze the layout provided:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar ('a') is located at (row 7, col 7).\n2. **Surrounding Environment**:\n   - Up: (row 6, col 7) is an empty floor ('.').\n   - Down: (row 8, col 7) is also an empty floor ('.').\n   - Left: (row 7, col 6) is an empty floor ('.').\n   - Right: (row 7, col 8) is an empty floor ('.').\n\nThe goal is to maneuver the avatar while avoiding hazards (holes) and maximizing box interactions to eliminate all boxes. In our current state, the avatar is surrounded by empty spaces with no imminent threats like holes. \n\nSince there's no restriction preventing movement in any direction (with no hazards around), the avatar can move in any direction safely. However, to leverage the current surroundings effectively, moving either up or left could eventually lead to interacting with boxes down the line.\n\n**In my action decision**, I will decide to move **up** (to (row 6, col 7)), as this could open paths to interact with the boxes below. This should be a safe and strategic first step.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up, expanding movement options for the next turn. I expect to see new surrounding spaces opened, potentially leading to interaction opportunities with objects below.",
