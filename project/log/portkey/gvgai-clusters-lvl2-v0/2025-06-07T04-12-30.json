    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle platformer** genre, where players navigate an environment while solving puzzles using various interactions between game objects (sprites) to achieve specific objectives.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are various types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, floors, holes, blocks) and movable objects (the avatar and boxes).\n2. **Sprite Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with blocks, boxes, walls, and holes in different ways.\n   - Boxes can bounce forward when the avatar interacts with them and can transform into different types of blocks, which seem to represent the primary method for manipulating the environment and achieving goals.\n   - The avatar is penalized for interacting with holes (which cause instant failure) and walls (which push the avatar back).\n   - Additionally, there are undo interactions that can revert certain blocks when specific combinations of boxes and blocks interact.\n3. **Environment Layout**: The layout suggests a confined puzzle room, surrounded by walls, with specific locations for obstacles (blocks, holes) and interactable boxes.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to:\n- Have no 'boxes' left at the end to achieve victory (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True).\n- Avoid certain scenarios such as losing all avatars (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False) or having a broken box (MultiSpriteCounter stype=brokenBox limit=1 win=False).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully navigating the environment and interacting with the boxes to eliminate them completely.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - Losing all avatars results in an immediate loss.\n  - Interacting with holes results in a loss.\n  - A timeout expires after 1500 turns, resulting in a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Careful Navigation**: Since the avatar bounces back from walls and loses if it falls into holes, you'll want to navigate carefully. Pay close attention to the layout and plan your moves ahead.\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes strategically to transform them into blocks and remove them from the level. Since each box can turn into a different block type when combined, experiment with combinations to maximize the number of boxes you can eliminate.\n3. **Avoiding Loss Conditions**: Be mindful of the holes and walls. Ensure your movements do not lead the avatar towards a hole, and always step back if you accidentally move into a wall.\n4. **Optimal Moves**: Since there is a limited number of moves (indicated by the 1500-turn rule), devise a concise plan that minimizes unnecessary actions while maximizing progress toward removing boxes.\n5. **Plan for Undo**: Make strategic use of the undo mechanics to revert less favorable moves when encountering box collisions, ensuring that you maintain control over the number of boxes remaining in the level.\n\nBy following these strategies and adapting to the interactions as you progress through the levels, you can effectively work towards winning the game while minimizing the potential for mistakes that lead to loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To evaluate the current state of the game, we notice that the avatar (denoted by 'a') is located at (5, 4). The objective is to eliminate all boxes from the environment without losing all avatars or falling into holes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar is at (5, 4), surrounded by a hole (at (5, 5)), which is dangerous since moving down would lead to a loss.\n2. **Nearby Objects**: To the right (5, 5) is a hole, directly left (5, 3) and above (4, 4) are empty spaces ('.'), and below (6, 4), there is a hole as well. No boxes are immediately in the vicinity.\n3. **Game Mechanics**: The avatar can move LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, or UP, but moving down is especially risky due to the holes.\n\n### Strategy in Action:\nGiven my current position, the best action is to ensure I do not move into any hole while trying to find a strategy to interact with the boxes (specifically the ones in row 6).\n\nThe only reasonable action to proceed, without moving into an immediate loss, is to move UP to (4, 4), thus I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should keep me safe from holes and allow me to observe the current board state from a more advantageous position. I expect this aligns with our plan of navigating carefully to avoid loss conditions.",
