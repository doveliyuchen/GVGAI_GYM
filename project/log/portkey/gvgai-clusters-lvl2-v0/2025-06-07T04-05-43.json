This includes strategic interactions where one type of box and block may cancel the other\u2019s effect (undoAll).\n\n**Objective**  \nThe main goal is to have all boxes removed from the game (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0) to win. The player also has to avoid having the broken box sprite (MultiSpriteCounter stype1=brokenBox limit=1) in existence, as its presence would result in a loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**  \n- The player wins if all boxes are removed from the field.\n- The player loses if:\n  - The number of avatars reaches zero (indicating death).\n  - A broken box sprite appears on the screen.\n  - The time runs out (limit of 1500).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Plan Each Move**: Since many interactions can result in \"stepBack\" or \"undoAll,\" carefully consider each move. Avoid hurrying into actions that can undo progress or force the avatar to face walls repeatedly. \n\n2. **Utilize Box Transformations**: Make sure to manipulate the colors of boxes deliberately. The specific interactions with blueboxes, redboxes, and greenboxes can earn you points and potentially help clear boxes more effectively.\n\n3. **Manage Movement**: Always be aware of the avatar's inability to move through walls. Using the boxes to bounce off other sprites or maneuvering around tricky spots without falling into holes should be prioritized to conserve the avatar.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Aim for quick decision-making to remove boxes while avoiding actions leading to losses such as encountering the hole or invoking an undo on significant moves.\n\n5. **Prioritize Box Removal**: Focus on getting rid of boxes that do not lead to transformations that could result in undoing previous actions. This keeps the pace of clearing boxes consistent.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can navigate through the puzzles logically and optimally, advancing the game while minimizing risks associated with the loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> a\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

The surrounding tiles include a green box (`%`) to the north (row 6, col 5), an empty floor (`.`) to the south (row 8, col 5), a red box (`b`) to the east (row 7, col 10), and several walls (`g`) surrounding the upper and left sides.\n\nGiven the mechanics and the strategies outlined, it is essential to focus on moving towards boxes to transform or remove them while avoiding the holes to prevent losing points.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving UP (row 6, col 5) will place me on a green box (`%`), which I may be able to interact with and potentially change its state. This is an important move as it can lead to earning points or clearing it efficiently.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is aimed to maximize interactions with boxes and explore transformations while keeping clear of hazards such as holes.",
