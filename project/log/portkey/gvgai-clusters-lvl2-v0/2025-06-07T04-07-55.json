Given its focus on manipulating blocks and avoiding hazards while trying to achieve objectives, it also has platforming elements because of the presence of an avatar that can move and interact with various sprites (objects).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The game utilizes different types of sprites (blocks, boxes, walls, etc.) that have specific interactions.\n- The avatar can move around the level and interact with various blocks to change their states (for example, transforming one block into another).\n- Certain interactions can modify the position or condition of other objects (e.g., bouncing off boxes or being killed by falling into holes).\n- Specific color-coded blocks and boxes can be transformed into other objects, granting points.\n- Players can undo actions that involve multiple boxes or blocks interacting with each other, thus allowing for strategic maneuvering.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes, while avoiding hazards. Players aim to navigate the level such that they can use the avatar to manipulate boxes effectively, turning them into other types that score points and contribute to the elimination of boxes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: The game is won when there are no boxes left in the level (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`).\n- Loss Conditions: The game is lost if the avatar runs out of lives (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`), if a \"broken box\" is present in the level (`MultiSpriteCounter stype1=brokenBox limit=1 win=False`), or if the player runs out of time (`Timeout limit=1500 win=False`).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Moves Ahead:** Always anticipate the consequences of moving your avatar. Look ahead to ensure that your actions will not trap you or eliminate options.\n  \n2. **Utilize Box Transformations:** Focus on transforming blue, red, and green boxes into corresponding blocks to maximize point gains and advance towards your goal of eliminating all boxes. Keep in mind the interactions that allow multiple transformations and actively use those to your advantage.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Stay away from holes and walls where your movement will be restricted. Placement of boxes can help in navigating around these hazards.\n\n4. **Manage Time:** Keep an eye on the time limit to avoid losing due to timeout. Speed up the process of transforming boxes where possible.\n  \n5. **Use Resetting Mechanism Wisely:** Learn how various box interactions allow for undoing actions. This can create opportunities for new strategies if you find you\u2019ve made an error or taken a wrong turn.\n\n6. **Prioritize Box Removal:** Since eliminating boxes is key to winning, create strategies that allow for rapid removal of boxes while maintaining your life status.\n\n7. **Experiment and Adapt:** If you encounter tough sections, don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with the box interactions to find different solutions.\n\nOverall, the game requires a combination of strategic planning, quick thinking, and puzzle-solving skills to progress and achieve victory while effectively managing hazards and time constraints.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> a\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state, let's analyze the position of the avatar and the surrounding environment.\n\n### Avatar's Current Position\n- The avatar is located at (6, 2).\n\n### Surrounding Environment\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n  - Up (5, 2): Blue box (`#`)\n  - Down (7, 2): Green box (`%`)\n  - Left (6, 1): Empty floor (`.`)\n  - Right (6, 3): Red box (`b`)\n\n### Objectives\nThe goals are to eliminate the boxes while navigating carefully around hazards and obstacles.\n\n### Actions\n1. The avatar can move to interact with the surrounding boxes.\n2. Moving up will change the state of the blue box to a blue block, which will contribute to the score.\n3. Moving down will simply land on a green box, which isn't immediately favorable since it doesn't help eliminate boxes.\n4. Moving left (6, 1) or right (6, 3) also provides additional interactions with empty floor or the red box.\n\n### Current Strategy\nGiven the immediate options, the best move for the avatar is to go **up** to (5, 2) which allows the avatar to interact with the blue box and eliminate it, contributing to the overall goal.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action will transform the blue box into a blue block, aligning with the strategy of eliminating boxes efficiently. I expect this move will progress toward the objective of reducing the box count without running into hazards.",
