    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the video game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer, where players navigate a 2D grid-based environment and manipulate objects to achieve certain goals. The interactions suggest an emphasis on spatial reasoning and problem-solving.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various types of immovable and movable objects, including:\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move throughout the level.\n  - **Blocks and Boxes**: Different types of blocks (colored) and boxes that interact with each other in distinct ways.\n  - **Holes**: Dangerous areas that lead to death if the avatar falls into them.\n  - **Walls**: Immovable objects that block the avatar's path.\n\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes, be pushed back by walls or blocks, and transform boxes into blocks upon interaction.\n  - Specific combinations of boxes and blocks can \"undo\" previous transformations, suggesting a strategy based on managing these transformations effectively.\n  \n- **Termination Conditions**: \n  - The game ends in either victory or defeat based on:\n    - Losing if the avatar is destroyed (which can happen if it interacts with the hole).\n    - Winning if all boxes have been transformed or manipulated into \"broken box\" states.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to manage the boxes in such a way that you can either eliminate all of them or successfully navigate the level without falling into holes or getting stuck. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  1. All boxes are transformed into states that contribute to victory.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  1. The avatar reaches zero lives (SpriteCounter limit is 0).\n  2. At least one broken box exists (indicating a failure in managing the boxes).\n  3. A time limit is reached (indicating failure to resolve the level quickly).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before moving the avatar, plan a series of moves that ensure the avatar can manipulate boxes without falling into holes.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use the different interactions between boxes and blocks to your advantage. For example, try to keep track of how boxes can transform into blocks and vice versa. \n\n3. **Avoid Holes**: The holes are instant losses, so always check the surroundings before moving. Keep your avatar safely away from potential traps.\n\n4. **Manage Space**: As the level includes walls and limited space, make sure to bounce boxes strategically to push them into safe positions where they won\u2019t cause the avatar to backtrack into dangerous areas.\n\n5. **Monitor Actions**: Since some interactions \"undo\" past changes, be cautious about which transformations you perform, especially when executing moves that can affect previously positioned boxes.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively navigate through the level, manipulate the objects to meet the game's objectives, and avoid premature losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, let's analyze the situation with the avatar located at row 6, column 4. The immediate surroundings are as follows:\n\n- **(5,4)**: Hole ('&') - Dangerous area below.\n- **(5,5)**: Hole ('&') - Dangerous area to the right.\n- **(6,3)**: Empty space ('.') - Movable space to the left.\n- **(6,5)**: Hole ('&') - Dangerous area to the right.\n- **(7,4)**: Empty space ('.') - Movable space below.\n\nFrom this analysis, moving left (to (6,3)) is the safest immediate move, as it will not lead to a hole or interact with any dangerous areas. The holes in the adjacent spaces pose a significant risk; thus remaining away from them is paramount.\n\nAccording to the strategy laid out earlier, I need to plan my actions to avoid falling into holes and manipulate the boxes effectively.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to (6,5) is not possible due to the hole. Instead, I'll execute an action to move left to (6,3) to ensure my avatar remains safe and to open the path for future moves towards potential boxes and blocks.",
