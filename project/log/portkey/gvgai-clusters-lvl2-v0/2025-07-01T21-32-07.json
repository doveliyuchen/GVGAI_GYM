Players navigate a character (the avatar) through a confined space, solving environmental puzzles by moving and interacting with various sprites to achieve the goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites**: There are different types of sprites, including walls, floors, various types of blocks (blue, red, green), boxes, and a hole. Each sprite has unique properties and interactions.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the environment and interacts with different sprites, influencing the gameplay and progression.\n- **Transformations**: Certain interactions between boxes and blocks lead to transformations, changing their type and score value.\n- **Scoring System**: Players can gain or lose points based on interactions, especially through transforming blocks and manipulating boxes.\n- **Game Elements**: The game includes win and loss conditions contingent on the number of boxes remaining and the state of specific sprites.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to eliminate all boxes from the playing field by transforming them into other block types and subsequently interacting with them in a manner that leads to their removal. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Achieved when `SpriteCounter stype=box` reaches zero, meaning all boxes have been successfully processed/manipulated.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if:\n  - The avatar sprite count reaches zero, indicating that the player has run out of moves or been eliminated.\n  - A broken box is present on the field, which may indicate incomplete tasks or wrong transformations.\n  - The timeout condition is met, taking too long to achieve the objective.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Understand Sprite Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how each block and box interact. Certain combinations can lead to transformations that positively affect your score and box count.\n\n2. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Since the game involves strategy and planning, think ahead about how moving one sprite will affect the others. Avoid making moves that could lead to a dead end, where no valid moves remain.\n\n3. **Prioritize Transformation**: Focus on interacting with blue, red, and green boxes to transform them into their corresponding block types. This will help in managing the sprites effectively and lead towards clearing out all boxes.\n\n4. **Utilize the Environment**: Make the best use of walls and existing blocks to navigate in a way that opens up new possibilities for interactions. \n\n5. **Monitor Score and Sprite Count**: Keep an eye on the score and the number of left boxes. Certain moves can lead to a drop in scores or are crucial for achieving the win condition.\n\n6. **Avoid Holes**: Interacting with the hole results in a loss of a point and potential elimination of the avatar, so steer clear of it if possible.\n\n7. **Manage Time**: Since there is a time limit, be efficient with your moves. Relying on trial and error may consume valuable time.\n\nBy applying these strategies, players can effectively navigate through challenges in the game, manipulating sprites and ultimately achieving the objective of clearing all boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> *\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> &\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> a\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> &\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, let's first identify the position of the avatar and its surroundings:\n\n- **Avatar Position**: (6, 2) with sprite `a`\n- **Nearby Sprites**:\n  - (6, 1): `.` (floor)\n  - (6, 3): `b` (redbox)\n  - (5, 2): `#` (bluebox)\n  - (7, 2): `.` (floor)\n  \nBased on the current positioning and the potential actions:\n\n1. **Understanding the Goal**: Our objective is to eliminate all boxes from the playing field. In this case, we have a redbox (`b`) at (6, 3) and a bluebox (`#`) at (5, 2) in close proximity.\n\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - Moving **UP** to (5, 2) will allow us to interact with the bluebox (`#`).\n   - Moving **DOWN** to (7, 2) does not interact with any boxes but just lands on a floor (`.`).\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (6, 1) is a floor.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 3) would interact with the redbox (`b`) but the interaction is generally not as beneficial for the objective as moving to the bluebox first.\n\nGiven the context where we want to interact with the bluebox to start processing, the best course of action would be to move **UP** to (5, 2).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action aims to position the avatar to interact with the bluebox, setting up a successful transformation and interaction towards achieving the win condition. I expect this will contribute positively to progressing towards clearing the boxes.",
