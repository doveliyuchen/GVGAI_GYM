    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game falls into the **puzzle/adventure genre**, likely a 2D grid-based game where the player navigates the environment, interacts with various objects, collects resources, and avoids hazards.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game includes a variety of sprites (objects) such as terrain (walls, water, mud, fire), interactive items (keys, boots, chips), and doors that act as barriers. Different sprites have unique functions and constraints.\n2. **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar capable of moving throughout the grid, collecting resources and interacting with other sprites. The avatar can also be affected by certain conditions (e.g., getting killed by water or mud).\n3. **Resource Management:** The avatar can collect resources like keys and boots. Each key color corresponds to a specific door that can only be accessed if the avatar holds the respective key.\n4. **Kill Conditions:** Interactions can lead to the death of the avatar based on resource limitations (e.g., lack of flippers in water, lack of fire boots in fire).\n5. **Score System:** The game includes a score system where collecting items and reaching the exit can yield points.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, collect the required resources (keys, boots), reach the exit, and assign key resources to their respective colored doors to pass through them.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit sprite while maintaining the avatar's survival.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's sprite counter (denoting its existence) reaches zero before reaching the exit.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Prioritize Resource Collection:**\n   - First, assess the layout and identify resource locations (keys, boots, chips) and carefully navigate to collect them in a logical order. Focus on obtaining at least one of each colored key needed for the trapped doors.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Be mindful of dangerous areas like water and mud. Make sure to possess the required resources before entering potentially lethal zones (obtain flippers for water, fire boots for fire).\n\n3. **Utilize Crates and Walls:**\n   - Use crates wisely as they can be manipulated to overcome obstacles or create safe paths. Always be aware of wall interactions that can help to revert any unwanted movement.\n\n4. **Plan Key Usage:**\n   - Keep track of which keys you have and which doors you still need to unlock. Unlock doors as opportunities arise, but ensure it doesn't put you in a position where you're stuck or killed by resource limitations.\n\n5. **Reach the Exit:**\n   - After collecting key resources and solving barriers, plan your route to the exit. Ensure you have what is needed to get to the exit without running into hazards that require specific items.\n\n6. **Backtrack if Needed:**\n   - Sometimes, backtracking may be necessary to collect resources that were initially missed or to correct previous errors in movement. Use the undo mechanics to your advantage to navigate around obstacles effectively.\n\nBy following these strategic steps, players can maximize their chances of success while enjoying the puzzle and exploration elements of the game. Remember to think ahead and manage resources carefully!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
