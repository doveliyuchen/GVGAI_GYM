    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s a comprehensive analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle-platformer** genre, where players must navigate a 2D grid-based environment, avoiding obstacles and solving puzzles to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various immovable and movable sprites including walls, doors, water, mud, keys, and the avatar.\n2. **Interaction Dynamics**:\n   - The avatar can collect resources (chips and keys), interact with doors (which require keys), and navigate obstacles (such as water and mud) that can negatively affect its health.\n   - The use of keys to unlock corresponding doors implies a puzzle-solving element.\n   - Certain interactions lead to penalties or bonuses, shaping gameplay strategies.\n3. **Resources**: Players can collect various keys (red, blue, green, yellow) and items (boots, flippers) that provide advantages or allow for interaction with specific environmental elements.\n4. **Health Loss Conditions**: The avatar can lose health from interactions with certain terrain (e.g., mud, water without flippers).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary goal seems to be for the avatar to reach the **exit** sprite while collecting resources and avoiding traps. The player must manage resource collection effectively to successfully navigate through the doors and complete the level.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by navigating the avatar to the exit sprite, signified by `exit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0`).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Collect keys and resources early in the game. Efficiently manage them to unlock doors as you progress through the level.\n  \n2. **Plan Your Moves**:\n   - Assess the map layout and identify the locations of doors that correspond with the keys you possess. \n   - Avoid water and mud unless you have the necessary equipment (flippers, fireboots) to prevent losing the avatar.\n  \n3. **Use the Crates Wisely**: Utilize crates to navigate obstacles. For instance, bouncing forward can help traverse spaces and potentially reveal paths.\n\n4. **Key Prioritization**: Focus on obtaining keys that open doors you encounter. Doors require specific keys\u2014ensure you have the correct type before approaching them.\n\n5. **Exit Focus**: Always keep the exit in mind. Plan a route that allows you to systematically gather keys and resources while moving towards the exit, ensuring you don\u2019t block your path or become trapped.\n\n6. **Avoiding Hazards**: Identify and avoid mud and water if not adequately equipped. Make sure to collect the necessary items (like flippers and fireboots) before entering these hazardous areas.\n\n7. **Backtracking**: Be prepared to backtrack if you encounter an obstacle you can\u2019t bypass. Use the `undoAll` interaction wisely if your progress is hindered.\n\nBy following this structured strategy, players can effectively manipulate the game's mechanics to achieve the objective of reaching the exit while maximizing their score through resource collection.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar (represented by 'a') is located at (row=5, col=5).

There is a blue key at (5, 1) that could be helpful to unlock a blue door nearby.\n\n### Current Status:\nThe avatar has the option to move left to collect the blue key, which is a good decision because it may be required to unlock a blue door later in the game.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will choose to move left to collect the blue key.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is intended to help me collect the necessary key, aligning perfectly with the strategy of prioritizing resource collection.",
