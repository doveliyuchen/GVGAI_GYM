Players navigate through a maze-like environment, solve puzzles, and collect resources to progress.\n\n---\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various sprites represent different elements in the game such as floors, water, mud, fire, keys, doors, and the player avatar. Each sprite has specific properties and interactions.\n- **Interactions:** Players can interact with objects (e.g., collecting keys, moving crates, dealing with environmental hazards). The mechanics suggest that movement is key, and resource management is critical to successfully navigating the game world.\n- **Resources:** The player collects various keys and other resources which are necessary for opening doors and progressing through levels. There are restrictions on how many of each type of key the player can possess.\n  \n---\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level to reach the **exit** while collecting resources and avoiding hazards. Players must collect the appropriate keys to unlock the various colored doors that restrict movement in the maze.\n\n---\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by successfully reaching the exit sprite, indicated by the condition where the exit's sprite count reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, implying that the avatar can be \"killed\" by various interactions (e.g., touching mud, fire, or being blocked by gates).\n\n---\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Map Exploration:** Initially explore the maze to familiarize yourself with the layout and identify which resources (keys, boots, flippers) are available. This will help in planning your moves.\n  \n2. **Resource Management:**\n   - Collect keys (red, blue, green, yellow) as they will be essential for passing through corresponding doors.\n   - Be careful about the limits (one key type) to ensure you don\u2019t exceed the maximum allowed as this can lead to failure at the gates.\n  \n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Stay away from water, fire, and mud unless you have the appropriate equipment (flippers or fireboots) to mitigate damage.\n   - Plan your path to avoid unnecessary damage while trying to collect keys and move towards the exit.\n\n4. **Use Crates Strategically:** Use crates to block hazards or create pathways, as bouncing off crates can help navigate around obstacles.\n\n5. **Understand Termination Conditions:** Keep a close eye on your avatar's health (sprite count) and ensure you avoid unnecessary risks, as losing your avatar means losing the game.\n\n6. **Plan Routes:** Since there are multiple doors that require keys, determine which doors to use first based on your current resources. \n\nBy following this strategy while continuously adjusting to the situations that arise within the gameplay, players can optimize their chances of reaching the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",

My priority is to collect the fireboots, as I can use them to navigate hazards later in the game. \n\n### Recommended Movement:\nTo collect the fireboots, I will move **UP** to the position (row=4, col=5).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nCollecting the fireboots will add to my ability to navigate fire hazards later, improving my overall strategy without compromising current resources.",
