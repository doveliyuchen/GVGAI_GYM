Players must navigate a map filled with obstacles and interact with various elements while solving puzzles to progress and ultimately reach the exit.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Interactions**: The player (avatar) interacts with different types of sprites including walls, doors, keys, and environmental hazards like mud, water, and fire.\n- **Resource Management**: Players collect keys (red, blue, green, yellow) and boots (flippers, fireboots) that allow them to bypass certain obstacles. The player has limits on how many of each resource they can hold.\n- **Movement and Navigation**: The player can move to collect resources, open doors when they have the corresponding key, and must avoid or manipulate environmental hazards.\n- **Transformations**: The game features mechanics where specific interactions lead to transformations of objects (e.g., water turning into mud).\n- **Termination Conditions**: The game ends either when the avatar is defeated (Avatar Sprite Counter reaches 0) or when the avatar reaches the exit sprite (Exit Sprite Counter reaches 0).\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary objective is to **reach the exit** while managing resources effectively, avoiding hazards, and solving the puzzles that various obstacles present.\n- Collecting chips can also contribute to the player's score, but it seems secondary to progressing through the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if they successfully reach the exit.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar is killed by environmental hazards (like mud, water, or fire) or by failing to meet resource requirements at specific gates or doors.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Resource Collection**: Make resource collection (keys, boots, chips) a priority. You\u2019ll need specific resources to navigate different doors and environmental hazards.\n  \n2. **Environmental Awareness**: Understand how environmental elements interact. For example, avoid mud and water without the appropriate boots, and don\u2019t walk into fire without fireboots.\n\n3. **Planning Moves**: Think a few steps ahead. Since certain interactions can undo previous actions, plan your moves carefully to prevent locking yourself out.\n\n4. **Key Management**: Be mindful of the key limits associated with doors. Collect keys strategically and use them when necessary to open doors that will aid in reaching the exit.\n\n5. **Utilizing Crates**: Crates can be used to bounce and navigate around obstacles. Use this mechanic to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or avoid hazards.\n\n6. **Exit Strategy**: As you maneuver towards the exit, prioritize avoiding hazards and ensuring you have the resources necessary to reach the exit safely.\n\nBy following these strategies and paying attention to the interactions available within the game, players should be able to navigate through the level successfully and reach the exit while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
