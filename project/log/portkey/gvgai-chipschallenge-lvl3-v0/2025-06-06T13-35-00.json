    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules you've provided, here\u2019s a comprehensive analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game likely falls into the **Puzzle/Adventure** genre, with elements of exploration and strategy. It includes mechanics that require players to solve puzzles (e.g., obtaining keys to open doors, navigating obstacles) and utilize resources to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites/Objects**: There are different types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, doors), movable characters (avatar), and resources (keys, boots, chips). \n2. **Resource Management**: The player must collect various types of keys (red, blue, green, yellow) and other resources (boots, chips) which are essential for navigating through the game and reaching the exit.\n3. **Interactions**: The avatar interacts with other sprites, which can lead to various outcomes (collect resources, kill the avatar, transform objects, and undo previous actions).\n4. **Movement**: The avatar can bounce off crates and move through the level, but must avoid the hazards (water, mud, and fire) without the appropriate resources (like flippers or fireboots).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate through the level and reach the exit while collecting resources and keys necessary to unlock different doors. The player must successfully avoid or overcome obstacles without losing all available lives.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach the exit sprite while ensuring that the avatar has not been eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0). \n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Awareness**: Before attempting to progress through any doors, ensure that you have the corresponding key. Collect as many chips and keys as possible, as they provide essential advantages and scoring opportunities.\n   \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Always check if you have the necessary resources (flippers for water, fireboots for fire) before entering hazardous environments. Plan your routes to avoid mud, which can be deadly to the avatar.\n\n3. **Utilize Resources Wisely**: Use keys judiciously because the game limits the number of times certain doors can be opened. Collecting resources like boots can also boost your score and survivability.\n\n4. **Puzzles and Timing**: Think strategically about how to move crates. Since interaction with them can affect movement and resources, you\u2019ll need to be careful not to trap yourself or lose keys unnecessarily.\n\n5. **Explore Thoroughly**: Take your time to explore each part of the level. There may be hidden resources or alternative paths that could simplify your route to the exit.\n\nBy focusing on resource management, strategic movement, and careful navigation through hazards, you can effectively compile a successful approach to completing the level and achieving a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
