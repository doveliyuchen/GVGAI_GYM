    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**:  \nThe game appears to belong to the adventure/puzzle genre. It requires players to navigate a maze-like environment, solve challenges, collect keys, and manage resources while avoiding obstacles and dangers.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: The game contains various sprites including floors, water, mud, fire, keys, doors, additional resources/items (such as boots and chips), and walls that the player can interact with.\n- **Resources**: The player collects keys (red, blue, green, yellow) and other items like boots and chips to progress through the environment. The keys are necessary for opening color-specific doors.\n- **Avatar Movement**: Players control an avatar that can move through the sprites but must adhere to the interactions defined by the rules\u2014some sprites are deadly (like mud and fire).\n- **Transformations**: Certain interactions can change the state of sprites, like transforming crates into mud when in contact with water.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe main objective is to lead the avatar to the exit while collecting chips and keys available in the level. The avatar needs to navigate through a maze, overcoming obstacles, solving challenges, and managing the resources effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit sprite, which increases their score.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite is eliminated (SpriteCounter limit reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Acquaint yourself with the layout of the level, noting the positions of doors, resources, and dangerous sprites (like mud and fire).\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - Focus on collecting keys to open doors. Ensure you have the required key before approaching a door to avoid losing the avatar.\n   - Collect boots for extra score and to manage the environment more effectively.\n\n3. **Obstacle Navigation**: \n   - Be cautious around water and mud. Avoid moving into mud without the proper boots, and always check the resource requirements before interacting with gates and doors.\n   - Use crates wisely; bouncing against them may allow access to hard-to-reach areas.\n\n4. **Strategic Use of Keys**:\n   - Prioritize the collection of keys to open the corresponding doors while keeping in mind the resource limits imposed by the doors. \n   - Gather other resources strategically so as to eliminate potential threats while securing moments to collect more keys and items.\n\n5. **Maximize Scoring**: \n   - Collect chips for points as you maneuver through the level; each chip collected contributes to your score.\n   - Aim for additional points by collecting accessories (like boots) that provide score bonuses.\n\n6. **Exit Strategy**: \n   - Once you have collected enough keys and scored sufficiently, start plotting a route toward the exit, ensuring that you aren\u2019t blocked off by walls or require additional keys to pass through.\n\nBy carefully navigating the environment and managing your interactions with resources and obstacles, you can successfully lead your avatar to the exit while maximizing your score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
