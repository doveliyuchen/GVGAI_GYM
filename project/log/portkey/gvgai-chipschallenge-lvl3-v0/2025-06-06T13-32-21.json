    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the rules and mechanics described, this game can be classified as a **puzzle platformer**. Players navigate through a series of challenges, interact with various sprites to progress, and solve puzzles involving resource management.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites (a.k.a. game objects) such as immovable walls, interactive doors, environmental hazards (water, mud, fire), keys, and collectible resources (chips, boots).\n- **Movement and interaction:** The primary character (the avatar) can move through the level and interact with sprites. Some interactions cause transformations, while others have resource management implications.\n- **Resource management:** The avatar can collect keys and chips to unlock doors and gain points. Certain doors require specific keys, and having the right amount of keys is crucial for advancement.\n- **Hazards:** Environmental interactions can be deadly (e.g., mud, water, fire). The avatar must avoid certain conditions or have the appropriate resources (flippers for water and fireboots for fire) to survive them.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate through the level to reach the exit while collecting resources and avoiding hazards. The player needs to manage their collected keys and resources appropriately to unlock doors leading to the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar (game character) is eliminated due to hazards or if they are left with no resources to progress in the game.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Collection:** Focus on collecting keys and chips early in the game. Make sure to avoid hazards that can cause you to lose resources or lose outright.\n   \n2. **Plan Your Route:** Analyze the layout based on the given level. Note the position of hazards (water, mud, fire), doors (which require specific keys), and potential pathways.\n\n3. **Key Management:** Keep track of which keys you have and which doors need them. Prioritize actions that put you in a position to use keys effectively while avoiding unnecessary encounters with hazards.\n\n4. **Use Environmental Objects Wisely:** Crates can be useful for bouncing or blocking certain areas. Use them to maneuver around hazards, but be careful not to get stuck.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards:** Always consider your resources before moving into an area with water or fire. Make sure you have corresponding gear (flippers for water and fireboots for fire) to survive.\n\n6. **Exit Strategy:** Once you've navigated and unlocked necessary doors, make a calculated movement toward the exit. Collect resources along the way to maximize your score, but don\u2019t linger too long near hazards.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of reaching the exit while effectively managing resources and avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
