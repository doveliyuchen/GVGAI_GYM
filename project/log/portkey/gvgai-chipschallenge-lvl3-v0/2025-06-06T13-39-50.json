Players navigate through a grid-based environment with various interactive elements, using logic and resource management to progress and achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The environment is built using various sprites\u2014obstacles, resources, and doors. Each sprite has specific properties and can interact with the player (the avatar) in different ways.\n2. **Resources**: Players collect resources (like keys and boots) which allow them to interact with doors, avoid hazards, or help in movement.\n3. **Movement**: The avatar can interact with objects to move forward (bouncing off crates) or can be hindered by obstacles (walls, water, fire).\n4. **Win Conditions**: \n   - The avatar must reach the \"exit\" sprite to win.\n   - Certain resources are required to interact with doors that block the avatar's path (red, blue, green, yellow keys).\n\n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to navigate the level and reach the exit by overcoming obstacles and collecting necessary keys/resources.\n- Managing collected resources is crucial, as certain doors will \"kill\" the avatar if the resource conditions are not met.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - The avatar reaches the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: \n  - The avatar's sprite count reaches zero, indicating it can no longer progress.\n  - The avatar encounters mud (which can kill it) or certain environmental hazards like water and fire without the appropriate equipment (flippers or fire boots).\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management**: \n   - Gather keys and equipment first, as they are essential to progressing through the level. Focus on collecting the boots and any required keys to avoid getting killed by traps or environmental hazards.\n   \n2. **Path Finding**: \n   - Analyze the layout before moving. Look for pathways that allow access to resources without exposing the avatar to immediate dangers (like mud or water).\n   \n3. **Interaction Understanding**: \n   - Familiarize yourself with how each environment sprite interacts with the avatar. For example, avoid mud unless you have the right resources, and be cautious of what items you may need to give up to pass through a door.\n\n4. **Utilize Crates**: \n   - Use crates strategically to bounce forward and navigate past obstacles. Position crates to block hazards or create a path to collectible items.\n\n5. **Planning Ahead**: \n   - Keep an eye on your collected resources and anticipate the need for particular keys before approaching corresponding doors. \n   \n6. **Checkpoints**: \n   - Keep track of your avatar's condition and the level layout. If you have a health or checkpoint-like feature, use it wisely to avoid losing all progress.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can efficiently navigate the complexities of the game and successfully reach the exit while managing the associated risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
