It involves navigating through a structured environment, overcoming obstacles, and collecting resources to solve puzzles.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n1. **Sprites**:\n   - Different types of terrain (floor, water, mud, fire) affect the avatar's movement and survival.\n   - Keys (red, blue, yellow, green) are needed to interact with corresponding doors.\n   - There are resources (chips, boots, flippers) that the avatar can collect, each providing different effects.\n   - The avatar can interact with crates, gates, and other sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect resources and keys.\n   - Certain actions can lead to the avatar's death (e.g., moving into mud, water without flippers, or fire without fire boots).\n   - Collecting chips increases the score and helps access certain gates.\n\n3. **Goals**:\n   - The main objective is to reach the exit while managing the resources collected to avoid death and unlock doors.\n\n**Objective**:  \nNavigate from the starting position (marked as 'A') to the exit (marked as 'e') while collecting as many chips and keys as possible. The exit also grants a score increase.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- Win: Reach the exit ('e') before the avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n- Lose: The avatar is killed (sprites counter reaches zero) or fails to reach the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Focus on collecting chips and keys early on. This will open up more paths and increase your score.\n   - Keep track of the keys collected, as each door requires a specific key for the avatar to proceed.\n\n2. **Navigating Obstacles**:\n   - Be wary of water and mud. The avatar cannot cross these safely without the flippers or will be killed.\n   - Same applies for fire; you must acquire fire boots before attempting to cross fiery areas.\n   - Utilize crates to create pathways if possible, but be careful as moving certain objects can lead to undoing previous moves.\n\n3. **Plan Your Moves**:\n   - Each action can have significant consequences. Plan your route towards the exit and consider collecting the keys beforehand to avoid backtracking unnecessarily.\n   - Look for patterns in the layout that allow you to minimize encounters with lethal terrains.\n\n4. **Little Steps**:\n   - Progress slowly, especially in areas where hazards are present. This can prevent unexpected deaths caused by miscalculated moves.\n\n5. **Exit Strategy**:\n   - Once you collect the necessary keys and resources, head towards the exit promptly. Ensure that your path is clear and that you have sufficient resources to avoid any final hazards.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can maximize their chances of reaching the exit while collecting resources and maintaining high scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
