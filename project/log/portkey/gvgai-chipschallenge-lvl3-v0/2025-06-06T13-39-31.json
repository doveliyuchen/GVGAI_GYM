    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and level layout, here's a comprehensive analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-adventure game**. It is likely characterized by navigating a character (the avatar) through a grid-like environment, solving puzzles by manipulating sprites, and dealing with resource management regarding keys and other items.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Movement**: The avatar moves around a tiled map, interacting with various immovable and movable sprites.\n2. **Resource Collection**: The player can collect keys (red, blue, green, yellow) and chips, which seem to be essential for progressing through doors and achieving a higher score.\n3. **Interactivity**: Different sprites interact with each other to either help or hinder the avatar's progress. For example:\n   - Collecting keys to open corresponding doors.\n   - Some resources are conditions for survival (e.g., drowning in water without flippers).\n   - Collecting boots can enhance the avatar\u2019s capabilities and score.\n4. **Obstacles**: The level includes various physical obstacles, such as walls, fire, and mud, which can eliminate the avatar if certain conditions aren't met (e.g., lacking specific boots).\n5. **Victory & Defeat**: The win condition is achieving the exit without the avatar being eliminated, while running out of avatars means losing the game.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level to reach the exit while collecting resources (keys and chips) to access different doors. Additionally, the goal appears to include maximizing the score by collecting keys and chips while avoiding obstacles.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (running out of avatars).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Start by mapping out the layout. Identify where the keys, doors, and other resources are located in relation to the avatar\u2019s starting position.\n2. **Resource Prioritization**: Prioritize collecting boots and keys as they aid in navigating the environment and prevent defeat. Each type of key unlocks a specific door, so ensure you collect the right keys.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay aware of water, mud, and fire hazards. Always ensure you have the required items (flippers or fire boots) before traversing these areas.\n4. **Score Maximization**: To improve your score, collect chips strategically while making sure to keep track of the limitations, especially those linked to resource caps.\n5. **Plan Movements**: Carefully plan movements to avoid backtracking unnecessarily. The undo mechanics in certain interactions can allow for strategic retreats to test different approaches without severe penalties.\n6. **Resource Management**: Keep track of your collected resources. Avoid using keys on doors without ensuring that they lead closer to the exit to prevent trapping yourself in a dead end.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game challenges the player to think tactically about resource management, spatial navigation, and timing. It encourages an engaging experience as players maneuver through a potentially perilous environment filled with obstacles and puzzles to solve in order to reach the exit and maximize their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
