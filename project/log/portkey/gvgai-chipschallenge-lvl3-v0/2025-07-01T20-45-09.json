Players navigate through levels, solving puzzles to advance and collect items.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n- Players control an **avatar** that can interact with various **sprites** such as doors, keys, water, and other obstacles.\n- The avatar can collect resources such as keys and boots to progress through the game.\n- There are numerous **immovable obstacles** and different pathways within the game, suggesting a design focused on strategic movement and resource management.\n- The avatar can **die** when interacting with water (without the flippers), fire (without fire boots), and can experience \"undo\" effects when certain conditions are met.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- Collect keys and resources to navigate through specific doors.\n- Reach the **exit** before your avatar is out of lives or hits the maximum score limit.\n- Collect chips and other resources throughout the level to increase scores, which are critical for managing interactions with gates and doors.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the exit sprite (exit) while having not lost all lives (avatar).\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore and Collect**: \n   Start by exploring the level while actively collecting all accessible keys and resources (like chips and boots). Focus on gathering items that will help you overcome obstacles.\n\n2. **Plan Movements Around Obstacles**:\n   Be mindful of your positioning relative to obstacles such as water and mud to avoid losing resources. Use the crates strategically to navigate through tight spots or block pathways.\n\n3. **Prioritize Key Collection**:\n   Keys (red, green, blue, yellow) are essential for opening their corresponding doors. Shoot for keys first to unlock areas and clear your path. Remember that standing in front of doors without the corresponding key can lead to death.\n\n4. **Use Resources Wisely**:\n   Certain doors will only allow passage if you have at least one of the respective key type. Manage your resources effectively, ensuring you're not ambushing yourself against doors without keys.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   Pay attention to the hazard sprites (water, fire, mud) and understand the specific requirements (like boots required) to avoid being killed. If you need special items (like flippers or fire boots) to safely navigate areas, prioritize acquiring them before venturing too deep.\n\n6. **Time Your Moves**:\n   The level is designed with traps and immovable tiles; timing and planning your moves will be essential. Always have an escape route in case you encounter an unforeseen peril.\n\n7. **Exit Strategy**:\n   Plan your route to the exit once you've collected enough resources. Ensure you have a clearance path without dead ends, keeping in mind that you should not lose your avatar before reaching the exit.\n\nBy strategically collecting resources, avoiding hazards, and carefully navigating through doors, you can effectively progress through the levels and reach the exit to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> a\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> h\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
