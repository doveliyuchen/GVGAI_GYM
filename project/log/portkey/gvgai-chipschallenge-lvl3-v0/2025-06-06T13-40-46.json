    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle platformer**, where players navigate through a grid-like environment, solve challenges, and interact with various sprites in order to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The gameplay revolves around manipulating different types of sprites (characters and obstacles), each with specific properties like immovable status, resource collection, and interactions.\n- **Resources**: The player controls an avatar that can collect keys, boots, chips, and other resources to progress.\n- **Interaction**: The avatar experiences both beneficial and detrimental effects based on the sprites it interacts with. For example, certain doors require keys for passage, while water and mud can be lethal without the correct resources.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the grid and must navigate through various obstacles to reach the exit.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the exit while collecting resources, avoiding hazards, and navigating through doors that require specific keys.\n- Collecting chips, keys, and boots contributes to the score and enables access to different areas.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit sprite while following the game's rules.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (sprite counter limit is 0) or cannot continue due to lack of required resources (resources like flippers or fireboots for specific environments).\n\n#### Strategies\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Prioritize collecting keys and boots as they are essential for navigating through doors and avoiding hazards (like mud and fire).\n   - Collect chips for scoring, keeping an eye on the limit.\n\n2. **Path Planning**:\n   - Analyze the level layout to find the best path to the exit while avoiding walls, which undo progress.\n   - Plan your moves carefully since some interactions can bounce you back or kill your avatar depending on their resource availability.\n\n3. **Utilizing Interaction Types**:\n   - Understand the implications of interacting with mud, water, and fire, and always make sure you have the resource required to traverse these areas (flippers for water, fireboots for fire).\n   - Use crates strategically to help navigate obstacles or trigger other interactions.\n\n4. **Key Management**:\n   - Keep track of doors that require keys; solve the puzzle of which keys you need to gather before reaching each door.\n   - Avoid unnecessary interactions with gates that might result in a kill if you don\u2019t have enough chips.\n\n5. **Exploration**:\n   - Explore carefully to find all the keys and boots before trying to access the exit. \n   - Consider the score impact of each resource; focus on efficient paths that maximize score.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the game mechanics in-depth, players can effectively navigate the challenging environment to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
