    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThe game appears to be a puzzle-adventure game, likely influenced by classic games like *Zelda* or *Chip's Challenge*. The player explores a grid-based map, solving puzzles related to collecting keys and navigating obstacles.\n\n**Mechanics:** \n- **Sprites:** The game has various immovable sprites representing terrain (floor, water, mud, fire) and collectibles (keys of different colors, boots, chips).\n- **Interactions:** The player character can interact with crates, doors, and terrain types, affecting their resources and movement options. \n- **Resources:** The player collects keys and boots to interact with doors, and chips for scoring.\n  \n**Objective:** \nThe main goal is to navigate through the maze, collect keys and other items, and ultimately reach the exit. Resources collected can also contribute to the player's score.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The player wins by reaching the exit ('exit' sprite) and collecting enough resources to fulfill any requirements (like keys).\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the avatar (player character) runs out of lives (sprite count reaches zero) or is killed by obstacles like mud and water without the necessary equipment.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Exploration:** Move carefully through the levels, exploring all areas to find keys and resources.\n2. **Resource Management:** Keep track of keys you need to pass through the colored doors and make sure you collect them. Avoid using them unless necessary to minimize loss.\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Stay away from mud (which kills the avatar) and keep the necessary equipment (like flippers to cross water).\n4. **Utilize Crates:** Use crates strategically to navigate obstacles or clear paths. If you encounter mud, try to transform it back to floor using a crate.\n5. **Prioritize Key Collection:** Keys allow progression through the maze, so prioritize collecting those over chips, unless you are close to the score limit.\n6. **Plan Routes:** Be mindful of your paths to the exit; sometimes, backtracking is necessary to collect missed resources.\n7. **Exit Strategy:** When near the exit, ensure you have enough resources to get there safely and without losing lives.\n\nUltimately, success in this game requires a thoughtful approach to exploration and meticulous planning regarding resource management.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
