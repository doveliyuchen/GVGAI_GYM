    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer. Players control an avatar to navigate through a maze, solve puzzles, and collect resources.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites, including walls, doors, keys, elements like water and fire, and collectibles like chips and boots.\n2. **Avatar Control:** The player controls an avatar to move through the level, interact with different sprites, and collect necessary resources.\n3. **Resource Management:** There are keys and special items (boots and flippers) that are essential for navigating obstacles.\n4. **Interactions:** \n   - Collecting items (keys, chips).\n   - Avoiding hazards (water, mud, fire).\n   - Interacting with doors that require specific keys to pass.\n   - Certain interactions cause items to transform or create new states (e.g., crate transforming into mud).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to navigate from the starting position (marked as 'A') to the exit while collecting necessary resources such as keys and chips. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The player wins by reaching the exit sprite (labeled as 'ex').\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the avatar sprite is reduced to zero, indicating that they can no longer continue (i.e., avatar is killed through interactions with mud, water, or fire if lacking necessary resources).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore and Collect:** Start by exploring the environment. Your first priority should be to collect essential resources like keys, chips, and any special boots as you progress.\n\n2. **Plan Routes:** Pay attention to the types of doors and the corresponding keys you may need. Keep track of which doors require which keys, and avoid situations where you can\u2019t turn back.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of mud, as it will kill your avatar upon contact. Similarly, be cautious around water and fire unless you have the necessary equipment (flippers or fire boots).\n\n4. **Use Crates Wisely:** Crates can help you bounce forward or may be used to navigate obstacles, but be aware of how they interact with the walls, doors, and other sprites.\n\n5. **Resource Management:** Keep track of your resources to ensure you don\u2019t reach a gate or door that you cannot pass through due to lack of keys. \n\n6. **Calculate Risks:** If you see a need to take a risk (for example, jumping over a hazard to reach a key), make sure you have a way to recover or backup if the plan doesn\u2019t work.\n\n7. **Utilize Keys and Items Efficiently:** Always use the keys carefully based on the doors you encounter. Don\u2019t waste a key if you can avoid using it by finding an alternate route.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively navigate through the level, solve the puzzles presented, and reach the exit successfully!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
