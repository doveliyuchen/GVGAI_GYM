Players must navigate through levels, solving puzzles and overcoming environmental challenges while carefully managing resources.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Resources**:\n   - Various sprites (blocks) represent different environmental elements (e.g., floor, water, mud, fire) and interactive items (e.g. keys, doors, crates).\n   - Players collect resources (keys, boots, chips) by moving the avatar across the level.\n   - The environment reacts to the player's actions, transforming elements or causing character deaths under certain conditions.\n\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can move freely but must interact with other sprites to progress.\n   - Obstacles include different types of doors that require specific keys to pass through.\n   - Water can turn into mud affecting the avatar's viability, and standing in mud results in death.\n\n3. **Gates and Keys**:\n   - Various doors (colored) and gates serve as barriers, requiring specific keys to open, leading to different score changes and game dynamics.\n   - The amounts and types of keys are limited, adding a layer of resource management.\n\n4. **Death Conditions**:\n   - The avatar can die if it interacts with certain obstacles like mud (when standing), water (if lacking flippers), or fire (if lacking fireproof boots).\n\n#### Objectives\n- **Primary Objective**: Navigate through the level to reach the **exit**, while collecting chips and keys to accumulate points.\n- **Secondary Objectives**: Manage inventory effectively (keys, boots) and avoid traps that could lead to a game over.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully reach the exit without losing all avatars. The player wins if the exit sprite is reached with at least one avatar remaining.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if all avatars are eliminated.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Prioritize collecting keys and chips to unlock doors and maximize score. Keep track of metagame conditions, and collect boots early on since they provide significant score bonuses and facilitate movement across obstacles.\n   \n2. **Level Navigation**:\n   - Plan movement in advance by observing the layout and identifying paths that avoid traps and obstacles like mud and water without flippers.\n   - Always check what resources (keys / boots) are needed before approaching doors, ensuring the avatar is prepared.\n\n3. **Puzzle Solving**:\n   - Use crates and items to interact with the environment; for example, bouncing off crates can help maneuver past tricky spots without getting stuck or killed.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Be cautious when approaching potential danger areas (water, fire) and ensure that the avatar possesses necessary boots before advancing.\n\n5. **Observation**:\n   - Take time to analyze the level layout; sometimes, backtracking may be necessary if essential resources were missed.\n\nBy applying this strategy through careful exploration and resource collection, players can navigate through challenges efficiently and successfully reach the exit while maximizing score potential.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
