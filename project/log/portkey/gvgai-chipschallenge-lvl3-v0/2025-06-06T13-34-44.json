    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**, where players navigate through a series of challenges and obstacles using various items and overcoming environmental hazards.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites/Resources:**\n   - The game contains various tiles, including water, mud, fire, floors, walls, doors, and different keys.\n   - The player can collect different keys and resources (like chips), which are necessary for interacting with doors and enabling progress.\n\n2. **Avatar Interactions:**\n   - The player-controlled character (the avatar) can move around and collect resources.\n   - Different resources interact with specific barriers (e.g., using keys to unlock doors).\n   - Some resources provide special abilities or effects (e.g., 'boots' and 'flippers').\n   - Environmental hazards (like water and fire) can damage the avatar unless the player has the appropriate gear.\n\n3. **Obstacles:**\n   - The game includes immovable barriers (walls and doors) and hazards (mud, water, fire) that require specific actions to navigate.\n   - The player must also manage their resources carefully to ensure they do not run out, as some situations can lead to their demise.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal of the game is to navigate through the level, collect necessary keys and resources, and ultimately reach the exit. The player must protect their avatar from environmental hazards while solving the puzzles that gates and various obstacles present.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by reaching the exit (represented by the \"exit\" sprite) without their avatar being eliminated.\n- The player loses if the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Collect keys and items strategically, ensuring that you have the necessary resources to unlock doors as you explore.\n   - Keep track of the maximum amount of each key type, as some doors require specific keys that have limited quantities.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Always be cautious when navigating areas with mud, fire, or water. \n   - Equip your avatar with boots and flippers to avoid penalties when you encounter such obstacles. Prioritize collecting these resources early if you plan to traverse areas with hazards.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Look at the layout of the level before proceeding. Plan a route that minimizes risk to your avatar by avoiding areas with multiple hazards and ensuring you are well-equipped.\n   - Consider the interaction rules: for instance, using crates wisely can help you navigate through tricky spots.\n\n4. **Utilize Doors Efficiently:**\n   - Each colored door requires a different key. Make a note of doors you've encountered and the resources available to you so that you can unlock as many pathways as possible.\n   - Handle gates strategically; avoid areas that might lead to dead ends unless you are confident in your resource management.\n\n5. **Prioritize Collecting Chips:**\n   - Chips increase your score and may contribute to unlockable elements or higher scores. Stay aware of chip locations and collect them as you explore.\n\nBy managing your resources effectively, planning your path through the level, and avoiding hazards, you can successfully navigate to the exit and complete the puzzle.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
