Players navigate through various obstacles using specific items to access new areas and ultimately reach an exit.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various types of sprites are used to define the game elements, including interactive items (keys, exits, boots) and environmental hazards (water, mud, fire).\n- **Avatar**: Players control an avatar that interacts with these sprites (collecting keys, navigating doors, and avoiding hazards).\n- **Resources**: Players collect keys and other resources that allow them to progress through the level and overcome barriers (like doors).\n- **Transformations**: Certain interactions can change sprites (e.g., water becoming mud).\n- **Hazards**: Certain environmental tiles like mud, water, and fire impose dangers that can cause the avatar to lose.\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to navigate through a level and reach the **exit** while collecting resources (like keys and chips). Players must gather the necessary items to pass through various doors and avoid hazardous areas to prevent losing their avatar.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is killed (i.e., loses all lives/avatars), which can happen due to environmental hazards or hitting a gate without sufficient resources.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Collection**: Focus on collecting keys and chips as you explore, since these items are necessary for passing through doors and gathering points respectively.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Identify and avoid walking on mud (which kills the avatar) and ensure that you have the required boots before stepping on fire or water.\n3. **Use Items Wisely**: Some doors require specific keys. Make sure to keep track of your items and their limits to avoid dead ends.\n4. **Planning Routes**: Before moving, observe the level layout and plan your route to maximize resource collection and minimize unnecessary risk of injury.\n5. **Interactivity**: Make full use of sprite interactions\u2014use crates to bounce forward or create temporary pathways, and be aware that certain doors will kill your avatar if you don\u2019t have the required resources.\n\nBy following this strategy and being aware of the mechanics, players can effectively maneuver through the level and achieve the game\u2019s objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nbluedoor -> '@'\nbluekey -> '#'\ncrate -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\nfire -> '&'\nfireboots -> '*'\nreddoor -> 'b'\nredkey -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\nwater -> 'f'\nyellowdoor -> 'r'\nyellowkey -> 'w'\nmud -> 'h'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> r\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> f\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> f\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> c\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> &\nrow=4, col=6 -> a\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> f\nrow=5, col=4 -> f\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e",
