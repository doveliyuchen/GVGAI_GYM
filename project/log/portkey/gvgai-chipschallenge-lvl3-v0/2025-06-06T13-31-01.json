    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and layout, this game can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle platformer** with elements reminiscent of classic games where players navigate through obstacles, collect items, and solve puzzles to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: Various types of immovable hazards (like water, mud, fire), keys of different colors, doors that correspond to those keys, crates, an avatar that can move around, and an exit point.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar interacts with the environment to collect keys and resources while avoiding hazards. Collecting chips and various colored keys allows access to corresponding doors, and the avatar must manage their resources while navigating the level.\n- **Resource Management**: The game involves collecting keys and boots, which influence movement and survival, and managing them to interact with different obstacles (like doors and gates).\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is to collect enough resources (keys and chips) to reach and pass through the exit sprite. Players must also avoid hazards like water, mud, and fire which can kill the avatar or impede progress.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game when the avatar successfully reaches the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Level**: Begin by thoroughly exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout and locations of keys, chips, and the exit.\n  \n2. **Collect Resources Wisely**: Prioritize collecting keys as you encounter them, but be aware to keep track of your limits (e.g., only one of each colored key is allowed).\n\n3. **Use Boots to Your Advantage**: Collect boots early on since they provide significant score boosts and may help you navigate through mud or similar obstacles without dying.\n\n4. **Plan Key Usage**: Before approaching doors, check which keys you possess and use them carefully. Ensure you\u2019re prepared for the outcomes, as using a key can affect your resources.\n  \n5. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious around water and fire, ensuring that you have the flippers and fireboots respectively to avoid dying. If lacking, navigate around them.\n\n6. **Utilize Crates**: Use crates effectively to manipulate your position or bounce to move through the level strategically, especially since they may undo certain interactions.\n\n7. **Track Your Score**: While progressing, keep an eye on your score changes from interactions to help gauge if you're making efficient progress.\n\n8. **Reach the Exit**: After collecting the necessary resources, navigate to the exit while ensuring you avoid any hazards that may lead to your loss.\n\nBy following these strategies, players should be able to navigate through the level effectively and reach the exit while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
