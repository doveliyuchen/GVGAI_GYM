This can also help create pathways and solve puzzles.\n3. **Collect the Key**: Prioritize collecting the key early so you can switch to the **withkey** avatar form. This allows you to access the goal.\n4. **Explore the Level**: Take time to assess the layout. The avatar\u2019s movements are restricted, so understanding the placement of walls, boxes, and hazards will aid in navigation.\n5. **Count Moves**: Given the walls and bounce mechanics, keep track of moves to avoid getting stuck or miscalculating jumps.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level while maximizing their score and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, I need to determine the location of my avatar and assess the layout of the obstacles and opportunities.\n\nFrom the map, it appears that the player's avatar ('a') is not directly visible in the current representation, indicating that I might need to consider a previous state or the only possible starting position, as there are multiple objects and walls. \n\nThe primary interactions I can have involve either avoiding walls ('b'), falling into holes ('$'), or collecting keys ('%'). Given the strategic objectives, my immediate goal should be to move towards a key ('%') that I saw on the map at position (9, 11) or (4, 1) which appears to be accessible based on the surrounding context.\n\nConsidering the mechanics and goals, my initial action will be to explore and move in a direction that aligns with accessing the key or towards the goal directly, avoiding unnecessary hazards. Before I make an action, I need to confirm if there has been any rotation or if I'm in a position that allows my avatar to move.\n\nThe most strategic and immediate position for movement while considering the surroundings is to the right. Hence, I will take the action to move right:\n\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\n\nThis action aligns with the goal of exploring the map to approach the nearby key or other useful elements. I expect this will help in collecting the key towards reaching the end goal represented by '#'.",
