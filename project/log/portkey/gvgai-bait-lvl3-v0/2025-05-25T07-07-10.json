The presence of various interactive sprites, a moving avatar, and goal-oriented tasks suggests that players must navigate a level while solving puzzles.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: \n  - **Floor**: Base on which the avatar moves.\n  - **Holes**: lead to avatar death (failure).\n  - **Avatar**: The main character that the player controls.\n  - **Key and Box**: Passive items that players must manipulate to progress.\n  - **Goal**: The target to reach for level completion.\n  - **Wall**: Impassable barriers that restrict movement.\n  - **Mushrooms**: Cause instant failure if the avatar interacts with them.\n\n- **Interactions**:  \n  - The avatar can interact with various objects (walls, boxes, keys, etc.), and those interactions trigger specific outcomes (e.g., killing the avatar or changing states).\n  - If the avatar touches a key while initially being a 'nokey', it transforms into 'withkey'.\n  - The goal can only be reached if the avatar has the key, resulting in a win.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe player's objective is to collect the key and reach the door (goal) to win the level. To do so, they must maneuver through obstacles and avoid instant-death traps.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (i.e., the goal is reached with the key).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (i.e., the avatar dies).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand the Layout**: \n   - Start by analyzing the entire level layout. Identify potential paths to reach the key and the goal while avoiding holes and mushrooms that can instantly kill your avatar.\n\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection**:\n   - Aim to collect the key as soon as possible to enable interaction with the goal. The level structure suggests that movement patterns need to be carefully planned to avoid enemies.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Steer clear of mushrooms and holes. Use walls to your advantage to maneuver around these hazards safely.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Effectively**:\n   - Boxes can be used to bounce off of to reposition your avatar or potentially remove threats by pushing them into holes.\n\n5. **Plan Movements**:\n   - Every movement is critical. Think ahead about the effects of interactions, especially when bumping into walls, boxes, or any hazards.\n\n6. **Navigational Focus**: \n   - Always keep track of your position relative to both the key and the goal. The general path might involve going towards the top section of the level to access the key while considering how to get to the goal afterward.\n\nBy following these strategies, players will improve their chances of successfully navigating through obstacles and achieving the game objective of reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",
