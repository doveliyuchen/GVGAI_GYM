Players navigate through a level filled with obstacles and use problem-solving skills to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** Different types of sprites exist including the avatar, key, obstacles (walls, holes, mushrooms), and the goal. The avatar can move around, while other sprites have specific interactions with it.\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes, be killed by holes or mushrooms, acquire keys, and interact with the goal.\n  - The nokey (without key) transforms into withkey (with key) upon interaction with a key and can then open the goal door.\n- **Obstacles:** The walls are immovable, while the holes and mushrooms lead to death for the avatar, meaning players must carefully navigate around them.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal (a closed door) by transforming the avatar into the key-holding version (withkey) to unlock it.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero (meaning the door has been opened).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero (meaning the avatar has been killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards:** Keep a safe distance from holes and mushrooms. They kill the avatar, which leads to a loss.\n  \n2. **Collect Keys:** Always aim to collect the key. The nokey avatar must interact with the key to transform into withkey, allowing you to interact with the goal.\n\n3. **Understand Box Interactions:** Use boxes wisely. You can bounce off them to potentially navigate around obstacles or reach higher areas. Be cautious of the box interactions near walls and mushrooms, as these can result in a loss of progress.\n\n4. **Plan Your Moves:** Analyze the level layout before moving. Look for clear paths to the goal, avoiding areas with high danger levels (like those filled with mushrooms or holes).\n\n5. **Use Space Wisely:** Since the walls are immovable, plan your movements to avoid getting trapped by them, especially when bouncing off boxes.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can strategically navigate through the levels, collect the necessary key, and ultimately reach the goal without falling victim to obstacles.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To determine an appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation:\n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar is represented by `*` and is located at (4, 2).\n2. There is a key (`%`) located at (9, 11) which is essential for transformation.\n3. The goal (`#`) is located at (1, 11) which can be reached after collecting the key and transforming the avatar.\n4. The surrounding area features a mix of walls (`b`), empty spaces (`.`), boxes (`@`), mushrooms (`&`), and holes (`$`).\n5. There are potential hazards nearby with holes at (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 7), (2, 8), and mushrooms at (8, 1).\n\n### Current Strategy:\n- The immediate goal is to navigate towards the key while avoiding hazards.\n- Since I can move across floors labeled `.` and interact with boxes, the strategy is to move left or right first to target the next unobstructed move while drawing closer to the key.\n\n### Next Move Evaluation:\nGiven that the avatar is currently at (4, 2) and there are no immediate obstacles directly adjacent, I will check the left and right moves to see if they are clear. Additionally, moving down to row 5 does not present immediate hazards either, so I will first attempt to move in this direction.\n\n### Action Decision:\nMoving right to position (4, 3), where the floor is empty (`.`), seems like a suitable first step while ensuring proximity to the goal and the key.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThe action moves my avatar to the right and positions me towards a clearer path to eventually collect the key while avoiding the dangerous spots around me. I expect this aligns with the ongoing strategy towards our objectives.",
