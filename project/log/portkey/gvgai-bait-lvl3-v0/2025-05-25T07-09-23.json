It requires players to navigate a character (the avatar) through a series of obstacles and challenges while solving puzzles to reach a goal. Elements of exploration and resource management are also present.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can move around.\n   - **Key/No Key:** The avatar starts without a key but can obtain one during gameplay.\n   - **Goal:** The objective which must be reached using a key.\n   - **Obstacles:** Includes walls, holes, boxes, and mushrooms that interact with the avatar in various ways.\n   \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, be killed by holes or mushrooms, and interact with walls.\n   - Obtaining the key is vital for reaching the goal since the avatar cannot pass through the goal without it.\n   - Boxes can alter the avatar's movement and the environment's configuration when interacted with.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to collect the key and then reach the goal (the door) to complete the level. The player must manage interactions with other sprites to achieve this.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- You win the game by successfully reaching the goal sprite while in possession of the key.\n- You lose the game if the avatar is killed either by falling into a hole or by touching a mushroom, resulting in a sprite limit of zero for the avatar.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Hazards:** The player should navigate carefully to avoid holes and mushrooms. Losing the avatar leads to an immediate game loss.\n   \n2. **Collect the Key:** The first priority should be to locate and collect the key (transform the nokey into the withkey). This is essential for accessing the goal.\n\n3. **Plan Movements:** Analyze the layout before moving. Certain walls and boxes can be used strategically to alter the path or create necessary space.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Boxes can be used to interact with other sprites. The player should utilize the bounce effect to navigate through areas and avoid danger.\n\n5. **Score Management:** Touching certain sprites like mushrooms and using the goal incrementally changes score, which might prevent game completion. Focus on strategic movements to manage score effectively without unnecessary risks.\n\nOverall, this game requires thoughtful navigation and puzzle-solving skills to successfully collect required items and reach the goal while avoiding death.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, we have the avatar starting without a key (represented by '*') and located near the bottom of the map. Going through the analysis, here are the key points regarding the layout:\n\n- The avatar is positioned at (4,1).\n- The nearest obstacles include:\n  - A mushroom at (8,1) directly below that would kill the avatar if moved down.\n  - Several boxes and walls scattered throughout the level.\n- The objective is to collect the key (located at (9,11), represented by '%') and ultimately reach the goal (located at (1,11), represented by '#').\n\n**Immediate Actions Consideration:**\n1. **Avoid hazards:** Moving down is not an option (due to the mushroom).\n2. **Plan movement:** The avatar can move left, right, or up.\n3. **Collect the key:** The key is in row 9, and currently, the avatar needs to navigate through obstacles to access it.\n\n### Current Strategy:\nMoving left (to (4,0)) is not possible due to the wall, and moving up (to (3,1)) does not lead closer to any objectives but rather stays in the same section. Therefore, the only feasible movement is to the right.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar from (4,1) to (4,2). Since there are no immediate threats in that direction and it keeps progressing towards collecting the key, this aligns with the strategy of advancing towards it while ensuring safety.",
