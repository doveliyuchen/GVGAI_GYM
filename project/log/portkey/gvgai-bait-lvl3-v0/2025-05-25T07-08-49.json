    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game is likely a **puzzle-platformer**, where players control an avatar in a 2D environment and must solve puzzles to navigate through levels, collect items like keys, and reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**:\n  - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n  - **Key**: Collected to unlock goal doors.\n  - **Goal**: Represents the finish line; must be reached to win.\n  - **Mushrooms and Boxes**: Provide obstacles and interactivity, affecting the avatar's movement.\n  - **Walls and Holes**: Act as boundaries and hazards.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can bump into walls, holes (which are fatal), boxes (leading to movement), and mushrooms (fatal).\n  - The avatar can collect keys and transform from a \"nokey\" state to a \"withkey\" state after acquiring a key, allowing progression towards the goal.\n\n#### Objectives\n- Collect the key to transform the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey.\"\n- Navigate the level to reach the goal before the avatar runs out of life (indicated by the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win:** Reach the goal with the key (transform to \"withkey\").\n- **Loss:** If the avatar encounters a hole or mushroom, they are killed; if the avatar runs out of lives (sprite counter reaches zero), the game is lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Carefully scout the area to identify where keys are located and how to reach them without encountering holes or mushrooms.\n  \n2. **Navigation Tactics**:\n   - Use walls to bounce back from holes and avoid falling in.\n   - Leverage boxes to interact with obstacles, potentially clearing pathways or freeing up space to access keys.\n\n3. **Collecting the Key**: Prioritize finding the key without getting into situations that could lead to being killed. Approach the key cautiously.\n\n4. **Unlock the Goal**: Once you have the key, make your way towards the goal while staying aware of your surroundings to avoid enemies (mushrooms, holes).\n\n5. **Manage Lives**: Keep an eye on your sprite counter for the avatar. If you come close to zero, play more cautiously to avoid unnecessary deaths.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game requires strategic thinking and careful movement through a series of obstacles, emphasizing exploration and the management of resources (keys). Staying aware of your environment is crucial for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state actively, we can see the following:\n\n- The avatar is represented by '*' and is located at (3, 4), which is surrounded by obstacles: there are holes '$' below at (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4) and mushrooms '&' at (8, 1).\n- The nearest key '%' is located at (9, 11) and the goal '#' is at (1, 11).\n- There are many boxes '@' on the map, which might serve as potential obstacles or means to safely navigate around holes and find routes.\n\nGiven that the avatar is in a hazardous position surrounded by holes below and needs to navigate towards the key to win, a good first action is to move right to (3, 5). This will help check whether the space ahead can be navigated safely. \n\nI will execute the action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis aligns with the strategy of first exploring the level further to identify safe routes without immediately confronting the holes or the mushrooms while trying to approach the key or goal.",
