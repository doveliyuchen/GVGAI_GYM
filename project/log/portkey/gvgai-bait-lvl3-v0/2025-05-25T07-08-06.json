The presence of avatar interactions with environment elements, the objective of collecting keys, and reaching a goal suggest challenges often found in puzzle-based games.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different objects within the game, such as the avatar, obstacles (walls, holes), collectible (keys), and objectives (goal).\n2. **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can move and interact with other sprites based on predefined interactions. \n3. **Interactions**: \n   - Solving puzzles by navigating through the environment.\n   - Collecting keys to progress to the goal.\n   - Avoiding holes that remove the avatar from play and may reduce score.\n4. **Transformations**: The avatar can transition between states (e.g., from 'nokey' to 'withkey') upon interactions with specific objects.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the **goal sprite** (represented by a door) after collecting the appropriate key, thereby fulfilling the win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Players win by reaching the goal sprite (door) while in possession of the key.\n- **Loss Condition**: Players lose if the avatar is eliminated (counter reaches 0) before reaching the goal.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Exploration**: Navigate the map methodically to discover the location of keys while avoiding hazards (holes and mushrooms) that can result in the loss of life or points. \n2. **Key Collection**: Prioritize finding the key to transition your avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey', enabling progress to the goal.\n3. **Mapping Your Moves**: As walls and boxes interact uniquely, plan movements carefully. Some interactions might undo previous steps, so think ahead to avoid getting trapped or having to redo actions.\n4. **Score Management**: Some sprites (like mushrooms) will increase your score but can also lead to losing the avatar. Weigh risks versus reward when approaching these elements.\n5. **Avoiding Holes**: Stay cautious around holes; falling into one will eliminate you. \n\nBy focusing on strategic movement, interacting with the environment to unlock possibilities, and managing the avatar's state carefully, players can effectively work towards winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current game state, my avatar is positioned at (row 4, col 1), which is represented as 'nokey' or '*'. The primary objective is to collect a key and then reach the goal sprite ('#') at (row 1, col 11).\n\nTo proceed towards the objective, I need to locate the nearest key, which is situated at (row 9, col 11) and is represented as '%'. \n\nAt this point, I will consider my possible actions:\n\n1. Action DOWN (4) from (4, 1) will move to (5, 1) where there is an '@' (box), which is not an obstacle but will not lead me to the key efficiently.\n2. Action UP (4) from (4, 1) moves back towards (3, 1) where there is a '.' (floor), but this does not get closer to my goals either.\n3. Action LEFT (1) is blocked by the wall (row 4, col 0), so it\u2019s not viable.\n4. Action RIGHT (2) moves to (4, 2) where there is an '@' (box), continuing to explore that route toward the right would eventually lead us towards clearer paths to the goal and the key.\n\nMy next action will be to move to the right:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nI expect that by moving right to (4, 2), I will more efficiently navigate towards either getting closer to the key or opening up additional movement options for the subsequent turns.",
