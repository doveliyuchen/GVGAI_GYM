The use of various sprites, including moving avatars and immovable obstacles, indicates a game where players navigate through a level to reach objectives while solving spatial and logical puzzles.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that navigates the environment.\n   - **Key and Goal**: Collecting the key (when the avatar has none) is essential to unlock the goal.\n   - **Mushrooms and Holes**: Interacting with these sprites can lead to negative outcomes (e.g., losing a life).\n   - **Boxes and Walls**: These can either aid in movement or act as barriers that must be navigated around.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player must manage the collection of keys and avoid traps (holes and mushrooms) to maintain their avatar's life.\n   - Successfully manipulating boxes can create paths or solve puzzles. Bouncing off boxes can help navigate around obstacles.\n\n3. **Score System**:\n   - Players earn points through interaction with certain items (e.g., mushrooms and by eliminating specific obstacles).\n  \n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the **goal** while successfully managing life and key resources. The player must collect the key and then navigate to the goal without losing their avatar (which results in a game loss) and ideally while maximizing their score.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - The game is won when all `goal` sprites are removed (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n  \n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - The game is lost if the avatar's count goes to zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n#### Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Movements**:\n   - Initially, prioritize avoiding mushrooms and holes while navigating the level.\n   - Identify the paths that lead to collecting the key and getting to the goal.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**:\n   - Boxes can change your trajectory. Use them to bounce away from obstacles or redirect your avatar safely.\n\n3. **Collect Keys Before Approaching Goals**:\n   - Avoid the goal until you have collected the necessary key. Attempt to clear as many enemies before engagement to maximize your score.\n\n4. **Maximize Your Score**:\n   - Engage with mushrooms carefully for points, but only if you're certain you can avoid losing your avatar.\n   - Consider interactions that will allow you to remove items from the field efficiently.\n\n5. **Observe and Learn**:\n   - Take time to study how different sprites interact with each other to devise the best strategy for navigating complex sections of the level.\n\nIn summary, success in this puzzle platformer relies heavily on careful navigation, strategic use of available items, and planning ahead to ensure you reach your objectives while maintaining your avatar's life and maximizing score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state and suggest an action, let's summarize the key elements of the game state:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: We need to know the avatar's current position. However, it\u2019s not provided in the state description. For the purpose of this analysis, I will assume that I start near the first row of the available cells, specifically near (1, 1).\n\n2. **Objectives**: The game goal is to collect a key and ultimately reach the goal (`#`) while avoiding hazards like holes (`$`), mushrooms (`&`), and trying to maximize the score.\n\n3. **Key Elements in the Map**: \n   - The goal is located at (1, 11).\n   - A key is located at (9, 11).\n   - There are multiple obstacles including holes and mushrooms nearby.\n\n4. **Movement Options**: The player can move in four primary directions and must take care to avoid negative outcomes.\n\nGiven these elements, the next steps should ideally involve moving toward the key located at (9, 11) so that the player can then engage the goal safely. \n\nSince the avatar's position is unspecified but it should initiate from a navigable area (like row 1 to row 6), moving right might be beneficial to check for potential paths. I will act after analyzing the potential next safe move. \n\nHowever, in case the avatar is actually on the left side of the goal and it's not directly moving toward traps, my action will align with navigating to the right towards the goal first and then proceeding to the key.\n\nI'll assume I can start moving toward the right:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action is a rightward movement; my expectation is to either reach a safe position or get closer to the key while ensuring the path is clear of obstacles.",
