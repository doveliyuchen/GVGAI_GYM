Players navigate through a grid-like layout with various sprites (representing walls, goals, and other interactive elements) while solving puzzles to achieve specific objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character, which can move around the grid.\n   - **Key & Goal:** The avatar needs to collect keys to access the goal. The key transforms the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey' state.\n   - **Boxes:** Sprites that can bounce the avatar forward. Specific interactions with other sprites (wall, mushroom, hole) lead to different outcomes.\n   - **Mushroom:** If the avatar interacts with the mushroom, it results in the avatar being removed from the game and a score increase.\n   - **Walls and Floors:** Impassable barriers that block movement and force the avatar to step back if collided with.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar has various interactions with other sprites, which dictate movement and scoring. For instance:\n     - Stepping into a wall results in stepping back.\n     - Falling into a hole results in dying.\n     - Collecting a key enables transformation to a 'withkey' state.\n     - Reaching the goal with the key results in a score change.\n\n3. **Collision Dynamics:** \n   - The interaction with the hole and walls suggests that the player must navigate carefully to avoid being 'killed' (losing the life of the avatar) due to falling in holes or colliding with walls.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite (door) after collecting the key, while managing interactions with other sprites and avoiding negative consequences. Each level ends when the goal has been reached or when the avatar is eliminated.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning:** The player wins by collecting the key and then reaching the goal, which leads to the score changing positively.\n- **Losing:** If the sprite count of the avatar drops to zero (i.e., the avatar is eliminated), the player loses.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Explore Cautiously:** Begin by exploring the grid layout carefully, assessing the position of walls, holes, and boxes. This will help you avoid pitfalls and plan your moves effectively.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:** Ensure to collect the key as soon as possible. Pay attention to how the transformation from \u2018nokey\u2019 to \u2018withkey\u2019 impacts your interaction with the goal.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:** Use boxes to your advantage to control your movement and position strategically. They can be used to bounce forward safely or manipulate paths.\n\n4. **Avoid Mushrooms and Holes:** Keep your distance from mushrooms and holes since they lead to avatar elimination. Always look ahead to avoid columns or sections of the grid that lead into these hazards.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route:** Before making moves, strategize the most optimal route to not only reach the goal but also circumvent bricks and walls that may hinder progress again.\n\n6. **Score Management:** As gaining score through interactions is crucial, keep an eye out for opportunities to increase your score while focusing on reaching the goal.\n\nWith these strategies and understanding of the mechanics, you can navigate through the game while maximizing your chances of winning!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game and the sprite mapping, your avatar (represented by '*') is located at (4, 2) on the grid. The surrounding elements include a hole (represented by '$') to the right (4, 3), a wall (represented by 'b') above (3, 2), and multiple boxes (represented by '@') at (4, 1), (4, 4), etc.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Actions:\n1. **Left (ACTION_LEFT):** This would move the avatar to (4, 1) which is a box ('@'). The next move can be strategized based on the location of the box.\n2. **Right (ACTION_RIGHT):** This would move the avatar to (4, 3) which is a hole ('0'). This action will lead to the elimination of the avatar, resulting in a loss.\n3. **Up (ACTION_UP):** This moves the avatar to (3, 2) which is a wall ('b'). The avatar cannot move up.\n4. **Down (ACTION_DOWN):** This moves the avatar to (5, 2) which is an empty floor ('.'), allowing for a safe move without consequences.\n\n### Choosing the Best Action:\n- The only positive moves are to the left (into a box), or down (into an empty space). However, interacting with the box could provide future strategic options as there are walls and other navigational elements further along.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- **Decide to move Left (ACTION_LEFT)** to position yourself on the box (4, 1). This keeps you safe and opens up further navigation options.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to the box prepares for the next steps while avoiding hazards such as walls and holes.",
