    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle.  The game appears to involve manipulating objects and navigating a character through a maze-like environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an 'avatar' (presumably the character 'A'). The avatar can move, but is blocked by walls.\n*   **Object Manipulation:** The player interacts with 'box' objects, likely pushing them.  Boxes can be pushed into holes for a score.\n*   **Key/Lock:** A classic key/lock mechanic is present. The player ('nokey' sprite initially) needs to pick up a 'key' to become 'withkey'.  'withkey' is required to open the 'goal' (door).\n*   **Hazards:** 'hole' sprites are hazards that kill the avatar.  'mushroom' also seems to be a hazard that kills the avatar.\n*   **Autotiling:** Walls automatically connect based on adjacency.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective is to open the 'goal' (door) by obtaining the key, transforming the player sprite from 'nokey' to 'withkey' and then reaching the goal with the key.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All 'goal' sprites are removed (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True). This happens when the player reaches the goal with the key, removing the goal sprite.\n*   **Loss:** All 'avatar' sprites are removed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False). This happens when the avatar falls into a 'hole' or touches a 'mushroom'.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** The first priority is to get the key. The player must navigate the avatar ('A') to the 'key' ('k').\n2.  **Box Management:** Boxes are both tools and potential obstacles.\n    *   They can be pushed into holes for points.\n    *   They can be used to block paths.\n    *   Be careful not to get stuck!\n3.  **Hole Avoidance:** Avoid falling into holes.\n4.  **Mushroom Avoidance:** Avoid touching mushrooms.\n5.  **Goal Completion:** Once the avatar has the key ('withkey'), navigate to the 'goal' ('g') to win.\n\n**Specific Level Analysis & Tips:**\n\n*   The level is small, so careful planning is key.\n*   The '0' and '1' likely represent different floor types, but these don't seem to have different rules.\n*   The 'm' likely represents the starting location of the mushroom.\n*   The cluster of '1's surrounding the avatar's starting location may indicate an area where boxes can be pushed into holes.\n*   The key ('k') is in the bottom right corner, which suggests a potentially long path to obtain.\n\n**In short:** This is a Sokoban-style puzzle game with a key/lock element and hazards. The player must carefully push boxes, avoid hazards, collect the key, and then reach the goal to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",
