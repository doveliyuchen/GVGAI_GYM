Players control an avatar that must navigate through a level, interact with various objects, and avoid dangers.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Movement and Objects:** The avatar can move around a grid layout, interacting with walls, holes, boxes, keys, and goals. There are immovable sprites (walls, floor, holes, goals) and passive objects (keys, boxes) that can influence gameplay.\n- **Transformations:** The avatar starts as \"nokey\" and can transform to \"withkey\" when it collects a key.\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes.\n  - Falling into holes will lead to failure.\n  - Collecting a key is essential for unlocking the goal, which grants points.\n  - Mushrooms are hazards that also lead to loss.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to collect the key and reach the goal (door) while avoiding dying from holes or mushrooms. Achieving this will result in a win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The game is won if the goal (door) is reached while the avatar holds the key. This is indicated by the 'SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True'.\n- **Loss:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed, either by falling into a hole or by colliding with a mushroom ('SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False').\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore Safely:** Begin by cautiously moving to understand the layout and potential hazards. Avoid immediate hazards like holes and mushrooms to preserve your avatar.\n   \n2. **Collect the Key:** Locate the key, which is necessary to transform your avatar into a \"withkey\" state. Collecting this should be a top priority to unlock the goal.\n\n3. **Navigate the Terrain:**\n   - Use boxes strategically to navigate around walls and obstacles.\n   - Be careful when bouncing off boxes to avoid unintended consequences, like getting stuck or falling into holes.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path:** Once you have the key, plan the best route to the goal. Ensure that you can reach the goal without backtracking too far into dangerous areas.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards:** Always watch out for hazards such as mushrooms and holes. Anticipate interactions that might lead to unintended deaths.\n\n6. **Utilize Walls:** Use walls to step back strategically as needed, especially after interacting with the goal when you don\u2019t have the key.\n\nBy following these strategies, you should be able to complete the level successfully while minimizing the risk of losing points or the avatar. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nmushroom -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b",

    "content": "To start analyzing the current state, our avatar is located at (3, 3) and is in the \"nokey\" state, which means it has no key and cannot reach the goal at (1, 11) yet. \n\n### Observations:\n- **Hazards:** \n    - There are holes at (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4) to (3, 9) and (4, 1) to (4, 2) on the board, which can lead to losing if we fall into them.\n    - There is a mushroom at (8, 1) that will cause loss if contacted.\n\n- **Key Location:** \n    - The key is located at (9, 11) and is essential for winning.\n\n- **Goal Location:** \n    - The goal is located at (1, 11) and requires having the key to complete the game.\n\n- **Near Obstacles:** \n    - There are boxes which we can use to navigate (especially solid boxes '@') at multiple locations.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Immediate Action:** Since our current goal should be to collect the key, we should navigate toward (9, 11).\n2. **Route Planning:** \n    - Thus, we should proceed either left, right, up or down to move toward the key while avoiding immediate hazards.\n\n### Current Action Selection:\nSince our avatar is positioned at (3, 3):\n- Moving **down** to (4, 3) is possible, and this position does not have a hole or mushroom (it has a box instead).\n  \n``` Action:3 ```\n\nMoving down allows progression towards our target while minimizing hazard contact, and I expect to successfully explore further toward the key's location.",
