It incorporates elements of strategy, exploration, and possibly some action mechanics given the avatar's interactions with various sprites.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - **Environment**: Contains different terrains (ground, water, mud) and obstacles (walls, boxes).\n   - **Avatar**: A player-controlled character that can interact with the environment, hazards, and items (bombs, lasers).\n   - **Goals**: Players aim to reach the \u201cgoal\u201d sprite (a door) while navigating obstacles.\n   - **Weapons/Power-ups**: The avatar can transform into different items (like bombs) and use lasers to interact with the environment.\n   - **Hazards**: Water kills the avatar, and fire can damage the avatar or interact with other sprites (e.g., destroying boxes and creating mud).\n\n2. **Transformations and Effects**:\n   - The avatar can pick up bombs and a laser cannon which allows for strategic play (like creating sparks or destroying blocks).\n   - Fire interacts with multiple sprites to transform them or cause damage (e.g., overriding certain hazards into other forms).\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the **goal** (green door) at the end of the level, demonstrating problem-solving skills and effective navigation.\n- Additional objectives may include collecting points by destroying boxes with fire, denoted by the score change mechanic.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - Successfully reaching the goal results in a win.\n  - Continuing to score points by interacting with the environment could enhance strategic depth.\n\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar loses if it runs out of health points or if a time limit is exceeded.\n  - The game ends if all avatars are defeated, indicating a failure to navigate or defend against hazards.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Exploration**: Carefully explore the level for different interactions. Check how fire interacts with the environment for strategic openings (e.g., puzzles created by boxes and water).\n2. **Resource Management**: Manage health points by avoiding fire and water. Use items like bombs wisely to create advantages (e.g., taking out barriers).\n3. **Time Management**: Be aware of the timeout condition. Plan paths and use items efficiently to reach the goal without rushing, which can lead to unintentional damage.\n4. **Study Patterns**: If enemies exist, observe their patterns. Use this knowledge to avoid or eliminate hazards safely.\n5. **Use Lasers Effectively**: Strategically employ laser items to clear paths quickly and to manipulate boxes or walls to reach the goal.\n6. **Achieve High Scores**: If scoring points is viable, look for opportunities to destroy boxes and interact with fire to boost scores while progressing towards the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, focus on careful interaction with the environment and item management to navigate toward the goal. This game balances strategic use of the sprite mechanics with the challenge of maintaining health and outsmarting potential hazards, creating a rich puzzle-platform experience.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> $\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> a\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=16 -> $\nrow=8, col=17 -> $\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",
