This is achieved by navigating through the level and managing various interactions with the environment effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game by reaching the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar's health points reduce to zero due to hazards (such as fire) or if the specified timeout limit is reached without reaching the goal.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Take time to carefully navigate the level layout. Identify the positions of walls, water, boxes, and fire, as these elements can significantly alter your strategy.\n\n2. **Utilize Bombs Wisely**: Bombs can transform into stronger projectiles (bombm) that interact with other elements. Experiment with placements to eliminate obstacles or to trigger chain reactions with fire and other sprites.\n\n3. **Manage Fire Hazards**: Avoid fire or use it to your advantage; for instance, use fire to destroy boxes that block your path. Be cautious of interactions that can negatively impact your health.\n\n4. **Maintain Health**: Avoid contact with hazardous elements like water and fire which can lead to health loss. Stay vigilant and keep an eye on your health points, adjusting your strategy to preserve them.\n\n5. **Plan for Interaction Sequences**: Understanding how different sprites interact can help in forming strategies. For example, you could use fire to turn water into mud, creating new pathways or blocking hazards.\n\n6. **Timed Navigation**: With a timeout limit in place, it's essential to manage your time effectively, ensuring you explore and strategize without unnecessary delays.\n\n7. **Achieve Score Increments**: Certain interactions can give score changes (like when fire interacts with a box), which may be beneficial for additional gameplay elements or end-level scoring.\n\nBy combining these strategies, the player can effectively navigate through levels, manage hazards, and ultimately reach the goal while minimizing health loss and maximizing effective interactions with the environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nbomb -> '%'\nbombm -> '&'\nbox spark -> '*'\nspark -> 's'\nspark water -> 'w'\nmud spark -> 'm'\nfireStart -> 'f'\nfireStart mud -> 'c'\nfireStart mud spark -> 'd'\nfireStart spark -> 'h'\nmud -> 'i'\nbomb mud -> 'j'\nbombm mud -> 'k'\nspark wall -> 'l'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> i\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> i\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> i\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> i\nrow=4, col=9 -> i\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> i\nrow=4, col=12 -> i\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> $\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> i\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> i\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> i\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> i\nrow=6, col=6 -> i\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> i\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> i\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> i\nrow=7, col=8 -> i\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> i\nrow=7, col=12 -> i\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=16 -> $\nrow=8, col=17 -> $\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",

However, there is a pathway that allows for movement.\n\nThe strategy suggests exploiting the environment efficiently. The goal is above directly, but there may be obstacles depending on how far 'a' can move up in one action.\n\nThe avatar can move up to (8, 9), and from there proceed towards the goal.\n\nI will take the first action of moving the avatar up to examine the consequences of that action.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis is a meaningful action based on the strategy to reach the goal by progressing upwards toward the goal sprite.
