The presence of obstacles, enemies (such as water that kills the avatar), and a goal suggests it has a well-defined structure typically found in this genre.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites like walls, boxes, water, mud, lasers, and the player avatar, all of which have unique properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**: The gameplay relies heavily on the interactions between different sprites:\n   - The avatar can collide with walls and boxes, where stepping back is a reaction.\n   - Water is lethal to the player, while reaching the 'goal' sprite signifies winning.\n   - Bombs can transform into different states depending on interactions with the avatar, fire, or other sprites.\n   - Fire spreads, affects boxes, and can damage the avatar.\n3. **Goals and Obstacles**: The primary goal is to reach the \"goal\" sprite (a green door) while avoiding obstacles like fire and water. Completing objectives might involve manipulating other sprites (like bombs) to clear pathways or generate advantageous situations.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to navigate through the level, avoiding dangerous sprites (water and fire), and ultimately reaching the 'goal' door. The player must also solve puzzles and potentially use items (like bombs) strategically to progress through the level.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins by reaching the \u2018goal\u2019 sprite, which leads to the avatar being removed from play.\n- **Losing Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar's health points reach zero (via fire or other hazards).\n  - The avatar is killed upon interaction with water.\n  - The timeout limit (1000) is reached without successfully reaching the goal.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Constantly keep an eye on your surroundings to avoid water and fire. The avatar loses health when it touches fire, and water is instantly lethal.\n2. **Utilize Bombs**: Use bombs effectively to create sparks or clear pathways. Since interactions lead to transformations, carefully consider how bombs interact with other objects. This can create new opportunities.\n3. **Manipulate Fire**: Since fire can spread and interact with boxes, take advantage of it to destroy obstacles and potentially create safe pathways or clear routes to the goal.\n4. **Plan Movements**: Use patience and strategic movements to navigate around obstacles, especially walls that might force the avatar back.\n5. **Collect Points**: Interact with boxes in the presence of fire to score points. While scoring might not be directly tied to winning, it can indicate overall performance and fun.\n\nThe key is to balance between moving quickly to avoid hazards and taking time to think through interactions effectively. Focused planning around the available sprites will lead to better navigation and successful completion of levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> $\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> a\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=16 -> $\nrow=8, col=17 -> $\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",
