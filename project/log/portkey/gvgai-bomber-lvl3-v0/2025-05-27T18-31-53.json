The presence of various sprites like bombs, lasers, and fire indicates that players will need to solve challenges while navigating obstacles.\n\n#### **Game Mechanics**\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites include 'ground', 'water', 'mud', 'boxes', 'lasers', 'bombs', and 'fires' that interact with each other in unique ways.\n- **Avatar**: The main character or player-controlled entity is an 'avatar' that can interact with the environment, particularly with walls, water, goals, and other sprites.\n- **Transformations**: The game features complex interactions, such as transforming one type of sprite into another (for example, a bomb turning into bombm or fire transforming into mud).\n- **Combat/Health**: The avatar has health points, which can be decreased by interactions with fire.\n- **Score System**: The game includes a scoring mechanism through interactions that contribute to score changes (e.g., the box interacting with fire).\n\n#### **Objectives**\n- Reach the 'goal' sprite (a green door) to win.\n- Avoid being killed by obstacles (like water and fire) and manage health points.\n- Transform and utilize sprites effectively to navigate the environment.\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win**: The player wins when the avatar interacts with the goal sprite, reaching it successfully before any time limits or health conditions fail.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar's health points drop to zero, if the avatar is killed by water, or if the time limit of 1000 is reached without reaching the goal.\n\n#### **Overall Strategy**\n1. **Navigation**: Utilize the ground and avoid water and fire. Understand the layout and how walls, boxes, and the environment are arranged.\n2. **Resource Management**: Use bombs strategically to clear paths or create fire to transform water into mud, which may open new paths.\n3. **Health Conservation**: Manage the avatar's health by avoiding interactions with fire and planning movements to avoid risky actions.\n4. **Interaction Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the interactions between different sprites. For example, knowing that a box can be destroyed by fire can help in avoiding unnecessary obstacles.\n5. **Timing Actions**: Since there is a time limit (1000), focus on optimizing movement speed through the level while minimizing damage and interaction risks.\n\nOverall, success in the game requires careful planning, understanding of the interaction mechanics, and strategic navigation through the environmental hazards and puzzles presented in each level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nbomb -> '%'\nbombm -> '&'\nbox spark -> '*'\nspark -> 's'\nfireStart -> 'f'\nmud -> 'm'\nfireStart spark -> 'w'\nmud spark -> 'c'\nfireStart mud -> 'd'\nbomb mud -> 'h'\nspark wall -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> a\nrow=3, col=10 -> %\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> m\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> m\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> m\nrow=4, col=12 -> m\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> $\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> m\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> m\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> m\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> m\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> m\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> m\nrow=7, col=12 -> m\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=16 -> $\nrow=8, col=17 -> $\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",

There are various obstacles and elements around, with water ('.'), boxes ('@'), and the goal ('#') located at (1, 9). \n\nTo achieve the goal, I need to navigate up towards row 1 while avoiding obstacles like water, boxes, and flames. Based on the current layout, I can move left to (3, 8), but there are multiple boxes positioned at (3, 7), (3, 3), and others that may hinder straight upward movement.\n\nSince my avatar has not changed position, I will consider a different action from my previous movement. Moving left will allow me to reposition myself strategically before making a decision to move up or interact with the environment.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nI expect this left movement to not only change my position but also to reassess the surrounding boxes and water, allowing for a better strategizing regarding my next move toward the goal.",
