Players navigate through a level with various mechanics involving interactions between different sprites (objects).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game includes various sprites (block types) like ground, water, mud, boxes, lasers, bombs, fire, and the avatar. Each sprite has a unique function and interaction with the player.\n- **Avatar Control:** The player controls an avatar which can interact with the environment. The avatar can shoot bombs and is affected by obstacles such as walls and water.\n- **Environmental Interactions:** The game has specific interactions that define how different types of sprites interact with each other. For example, fire can spread, bombs can transform into missiles, and various obstacles can harm or assist the avatar.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary goal of the game is to reach the \"goal\" sprite (represented by a green door) while managing health points and avoiding hazards.\n- Players gain points by interacting with certain elements, such as boxes being burned up by fire.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by reaching the goal before the time limit (1000 units) expires.\n- The player loses if their avatar health reaches zero or the timeout limit hits before reaching the goal. \n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understanding Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with how each sprite behaves. Notably, walls block movement, water kills the avatar, and fire can damage or destroy different objects and your avatar.\n\n2. **Resource Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on your avatar's health points. Avoid fire and water to maintain your health.\n   - Use bombs carefully; they can transform into other materials and can be pivotal for clearing paths.\n\n3. **Strategic Use of Fire:**\n   - Use fire to eliminate boxes for points and to potentially create new paths. However, be cautious of its reach to prevent damaging your avatar.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Analyze the layout, especially around obstacles and hazards. The avatar's movement should prioritize safe routes while maximizing point-gaining interactions.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep track of the time limit. Don\u2019t spend too long at any section that doesn\u2019t lead to immediate progress toward the goal. \n\n6. **Explore Before Making Decisions:**\n   - As you navigate the level, take the time to explore interactions between different sprites around you rather than rushing to the goal. Understanding these can help you unlock new pathways or score points.\n\nBy utilizing the above strategies, players can effectively navigate through the puzzles and reach the goal before losing all health or time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nbomb -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> $\nrow=4, col=17 -> $\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> a\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=16 -> $\nrow=8, col=17 -> $\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",

The immediate next row (row=9) is all empty spaces, followed by row=10 which is also completely filled with walls. The objective is to reach the goal located at (row=1, col=9).\n\nThe available actions are directional movements or using items, with notable sprites around my current position (row=8, col=8).\n\nConsidering the environment:\n- I cannot move right (which would lead to (row=8, col=9)), as it remains empty, offering no opportunities.\n- I cannot move left (to (row=8, col=7)), as there's a wall at (row=8, col=7).\n- Moving up (to (row=7, col=8)) is an option; however, it leads to an empty space.\n- Moving down (to (row=9, col=8)) also results in an empty row.\n  \nIn this situation, there is no immediate movement leading me towards the goal efficiently. The next best option is determining if I can use a bomb nearby, but in the visible area, there isn't any.\n\nBased on the rules, the most pragmatic step is to take the action of moving upwards to explore potential interactions or pathways available there (row=7, col=8).\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nMoving up potentially provides more options, possibly towards other sprites or interactions to help progress towards the goal.",
