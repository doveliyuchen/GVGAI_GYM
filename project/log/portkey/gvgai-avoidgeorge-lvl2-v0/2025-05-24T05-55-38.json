The player appears to seek to keep their avatar alive while also managing other sprites.\n- Players might win if they reach a timeout limit of 1000, suggesting survival for that duration could also contribute to victory, possibly by minimizing score loss or managing interactions well.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n1. **Manage Interactions:** Focus on understanding how sprites interact. For instance, converting 'george' to 'annoyed' can create an opportunity to score points without being chased, allowing for strategic movement or attacks.\n  \n2. **Avoid Loss of Avatar:** It's critical to keep the 'avatar' (your character) safe while navigating the level. Be mindful of the locations of 'george' and other sprites that might pose a threat.\n\n3. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities:** Transform 'annoyed' sprites into 'quiet' sprites, which seems to positively affect scoring while also clearing threats from the board.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:** Since you can step back when interacting with the wall, use this feature to avoid tipping points where you might lose sprites or get caught by 'george'.\n\n5. **Time Management:** Given the timeout limit acts as a win condition, consider how to last the entire duration while actively managing and mitigating sprite threats rather than aggressively pursuing interactions that could cause immediate losses.\n\n6. **Board Navigation:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout - take note of movable spaces versus walls, plan routes that allow you to interact with sprites effectively while keeping a safe distance from threats.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can create a balance between offensive plays (scoring points by eliminating or transforming sprites) and defensive actions (keeping the avatar safe and maximizing the timer).\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge -> '@'\nquiet -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\ngeorge wall -> '%'\ngeorge quiet -> '&'\nannoyed -> '*'\nannoyed george -> 'g'\nannoyed george quiet -> 'q'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language

Since they chase the player, I want to maintain a safe distance.\n\n- According to the strategies:\n  1. **Manage Interactions**: I don't see any immediate transformations or offensive actions available, as the nearest sprites are either empty or not in a position for an action. \n  2. **Avoid Loss of Avatar**: It's critical to keep the avatar safe. I'll consider movement to avoid getting surrounded by 'george'.\n  3. **Board Navigation**: The safest action is to explore movement in regions that are not directly adjacent to active threats like the 'george'.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the immediate goal is to keep checking for safety while exploring movement options, I\u2019ll take the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, allowing me to explore empty spaces while keeping an eye on the nearby threats, and are not immediately surrounded by 'george'.",
