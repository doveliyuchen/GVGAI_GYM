Evaluate his position and plan routes that keep you out of his reach.\n\n2. **NPC Management**:\n   - Utilize quiet NPCs as tools to offset the negative consequences of George. By directing George to these NPCs, you can transform him into his 'Annoyed' state, effectively neutralizing his threat.\n   - If you have the opportunity, interact with the cigarettes to convert any annoying sprites into 'Quiet' ones, thus reducing potential threats and increasing your score.\n\n3. **Time Management**:\n   - Keep an eye on the timer. While managing interactions and movements, ensure you play efficiently enough to avoid timeout situations without needing to be excessively aggressive.\n\n4. **Path Planning**:\n   - Map out your path in advance, utilizing the layout of walls (`'w'`) and open paths (represented by `'.'`) to create a clear escape route from George and to reach the cigarette when needed.\n\n5. **Score Management**:\n   - Aim to maintain a balance between interacting with sprites for positive outcomes while avoiding George, as the score system penalizes negative interactions. \n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the game's challenges while maximizing their chances of achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->
