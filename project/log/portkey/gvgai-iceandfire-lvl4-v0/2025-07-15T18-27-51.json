Players control an avatar that must navigate through a two-dimensional environment while overcoming obstacles and collecting items.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Movement**: The avatar can move around the level but cannot pass through walls (interactions with walls result in stepping back).\n2. **Interactivity**:\n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites:\n     - **Chips**: Collecting them increases the player's score.\n     - **Traps**: Stepping onto traps results in a score penalty.\n     - **Exit**: Reaching the exit will score points and contribute to winning the game.\n     - **Feetwear**: Allows the avatar to collect special shoes that protect against ice and fire hazards.\n3. **Hazards**: The presence of traps (spikes) and environmental hazards (ice and fire) can eliminate the avatar if they lack the corresponding footwear.\n4. **Score System**: Points are awarded for collecting chips and reaching the exit, while points are deducted for stepping on traps.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate through the level to reach the exit while maximizing score by collecting chips and avoiding traps. The player must ensure they have the proper footwear to prevent death from environmental dangers.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Reaching the exit sprite (indicated by a green door) leads to victory, as it counts towards the points needed to win.\n  - Successfully collecting items and avoiding traps will contribute to achieving a high score.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - Running out of time (500-time units).\n  - Having the avatar eliminated (if SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Familiarization**: Study the level layout to understand where traps, chips, exit, and hazards are located.\n2. **Resource Management**: Collect chips as you move around while being mindful of traps and ensuring you gather the necessary footwear (ice shoes and fire boots) to mitigate hazards. The 3-score increase for feetwear can help in offsetting score penalties incurred from traps.\n3. **Plan Moves**: Before proceeding into a new area, assess which footwear you currently possess and choose paths that minimize risk (i.e., avoid traps and hazards without the appropriate gear).\n4. **Prioritize the Exit**: Always keep an eye on getting to the exit as soon as it becomes feasible, but balance this with the need to collect chips and avoid traps to maximize score.\n5. **Avoid Time Outs**: Since there is a time limit, maintain a quick pace while navigating the level, ensuring that your strategies do not lead to excessive backtracking.\n\nWith this approach, players can effectively navigate through the challenges presented in the game while maximizing their score and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nchip -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nfire -> '$'\nfireboots -> '%'\nice -> '&'\niceshoes -> '*'\ntrap -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=0, col=12 -> e\nrow=0, col=13 -> e\nrow=0, col=14 -> e\nrow=0, col=15 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=5 -> &\nrow=1, col=6 -> &\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> c\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> e\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> e\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> e\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> e\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> e\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> e\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> e\nrow=4, col=2 -> e\nrow=4, col=3 -> e\nrow=4, col=4 -> e\nrow=4, col=5 -> e\nrow=4, col=6 -> e\nrow=4, col=7 -> e\nrow=4, col=8 -> e\nrow=4, col=9 -> c\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=12 -> @\nrow=4, col=13 -> e\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> e\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> e\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> e\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=10 -> e\nrow=6, col=11 -> e\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> e\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> e\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> e\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> &\nrow=7, col=10 -> e\nrow=7, col=11 -> e\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> e\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> e\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> e\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> e\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> e\nrow=9, col=5 -> e\nrow=9, col=6 -> e\nrow=9, col=7 -> e\nrow=9, col=8 -> e\nrow=9, col=9 -> e\nrow=9, col=10 -> e\nrow=9, col=11 -> e\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> e\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> @\nrow=10, col=8 -> @\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> e\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> e\nrow=11, col=0 -> e\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> e\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> c\nrow=11, col=5 -> e\nrow=11, col=6 -> e\nrow=11, col=7 -> e\nrow=11, col=8 -> e\nrow=11, col=9 -> e\nrow=11, col=10 -> e\nrow=11, col=11 -> e\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> e\nrow=11, col=14 -> .\nrow=11, col=15 -> e\nrow=12, col=0 -> e\nrow=12, col=1 -> #\nrow=12, col=2 -> e\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> @\nrow=12, col=6 -> @\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> *\nrow=12, col=11 -> e\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> a\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> e\nrow=13, col=0 -> e\nrow=13, col=1 -> e\nrow=13, col=2 -> e\nrow=13, col=3 -> e\nrow=13, col=4 -> e\nrow=13, col=5 -> e\nrow=13, col=6 -> e\nrow=13, col=7 -> e\nrow=13, col=8 -> e\nrow=13, col=9 -> e\nrow=13, col=10 -> e\nrow=13, col=11 -> e\nrow=13, col=12 -> e\nrow=13, col=13 -> e\nrow=13, col=14 -> e\nrow=13, col=15 -> e",
