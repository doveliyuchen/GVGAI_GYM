Players must navigate a space, avoid enemies, and solve puzzles using interactive elements like crates and boulders.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move through the grid-based level. Interaction is key, with various movable and immovable objects.\n- **Objects**:\n  - **Avatar**: The player character that can be damaged and can move through the environment.\n  - **Enemies**: Randomly generated NPCs that inflict damage upon contact with the avatar.\n  - **Crates and Boulder**: Objects that can be interacted with to push them around or bounce off.\n  - **Holes**: Two types of holes (square and round) where specific interactions can lead to \"killing\" sprites, earning score points, or triggering other effects.\n  - **Walls**: Act as barriers that cannot be passed through.\n  - **Goal**: Determines level completion, and achieving it earns score points.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to **reach the goal** while avoiding damage from enemies and navigating through the level. Players also need to **manipulate objects** in the environment strategically to progress through the puzzle aspects of the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins if they reach the goal sprite, indicated by a goal counter reaching zero.\n- **Loss**: The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero, indicated by the avatar counter reaching zero.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Environmental Awareness**: Carefully observe the layout and understand how each object interacts with others. Note the locations of walls, crates, and holes, as well as where enemies spawn.\n\n2. **Utilize Crates and Boulders**: Use crates to block or move enemies, as they can \"undo\" enemy interactions. Use boulders to manipulate other sprites efficiently and create pathways.\n\n3. **Avoid Direct Contact**: Steer clear of enemies, as direct contact reduces health points. Instead, use crates to push them back or create distance.\n\n4. **Leverage Holes**: Cleverly maneuver boulders into the square or round holes to score points while also clearing the path to the goal.\n\n5. **Plan Movements**: As the game involves grid movement, plan moves ahead to minimize the risk of getting trapped or cornered by enemies.\n\n6. **Health Management**: Keep an eye on the avatar's health and avoid engagements that can lead to losing health points. Collect points for strategic kills to gain an advantage.\n\n7. **Prioritize Goal**: Always keep the goal in sight as the final aim. Use the score points gained through interactions to position yourself advantageously towards the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players should be well-prepared to navigate through the levels, solve the puzzles efficiently, and reach the end goal while managing threats.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The nearby notable features include multiple boulders (@) that I can potentially move to solve puzzles or defend against enemies ($), which are located to my right (columns 9 and 10).\n\nBased on the strategy, my goal is to avoid enemies and reach the goal (indicated by '%') located at row 9, column 12. There is a square hole (*) nearby at row 2, column 12 that could be useful for interaction as well.\n\nMy initial action should focus on changing my position strategically while minimizing health loss from enemies. Moving left or right could expose me to enemies, whereas moving up or down might allow for better positioning. \n\nGiven that my last position was row 3, column 2 and I appeared not to move last time, I will try to explore downward as there seem to be fewer immediate threats:\n\n**Action:** Moving down will position me into row 4, column 2. I will proceed with the action now.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows me to explore the area below my current position, which has more flexibility and could help avoid enemy interactions. I'm hopeful that this move brings me closer to the goal and not directly into danger.",
