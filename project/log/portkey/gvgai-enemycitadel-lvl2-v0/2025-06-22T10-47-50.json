Let\u2019s break down the game rules you provided into key elements for analysis.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle** genre with elements of **action**. The mechanics suggest that players will need to think strategically while also being aware of hazards and potential enemies.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features a variety of sprites that serve different roles, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and has health points.\n   - **Enemies**: NPCs that can harm the player.\n   - **Holes (Square and Round)**: Structures that can behave differently upon interaction with sprites.\n   - **Crates and Boulders**: These are movable objects that can interact with the avatar and other game objects.\n   - **Walls**: Are impassable areas that can cause the player to step back upon interaction.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The interactions define how the various sprites can affect one another. For example:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boulders and crates.\n   - Boulders can kill sprites when dropped into specific holes.\n   - Crates can be used to eliminate enemies when they interact.\n\n3. **Scoring and Health**: The avatar has health points; when interacting with enemies, it loses health. The goal is to score points by eliminating certain sprites (using crates or boulders) and reaching the goal sprite.\n\n### Game Objective\nThe objective of the game is to eliminate all of the \"goal\" sprites while ensuring the avatar remains alive. Scoring points is achieved through various interactions leading to the destruction of enemies and completion of tasks associated with holes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game upon successfully eliminating all goal sprites (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points drop to zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before acting, take a moment to analyze the layout and consider how each move will affect your ability to navigate the level and interact with other sprites effectively.\n\n2. **Utilize Boulders and Crates**: Since crates and boulders can be used to manipulate enemy placements and eliminate them, identify effective areas in the level where you can perform these interactions.\n\n3. **Be Cautious of Enemies**: Avoid running into enemies directly as doing so will subtract health points. Instead, use crates as shields or weapons against enemies.\n\n4. **Manage Movement**: Make sure to navigate carefully around walls and holes to avoid unnecessary setbacks. Use the boulders to clear pathways and deal with obstacles.\n\n5. **Monitor Health**: Track your health and try to minimize unnecessary damage. If your avatar gets close to losing all health points, reevaluate your strategy or retreat if necessary.\n\nBy combining puzzle-solving with tactical movement and strategic item management, players can effectively navigate this game, reach the goal, and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> a\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the map and the position of the avatar, which is located at (row=4, col=2). The immediate goal is to eliminate all goal sprites, represented by '%', while avoiding health loss from enemies and managing the crates and boulders available.\n\nExamining the surroundings:\n- The avatar is currently next to multiple boulders and also surrounded variously by crates, some of which can be moved to clear pathways or eliminate enemies.\n- There's a goal sprite at position (row=9, col=12) that needs to be accessed.\n- There is an enemy at (row=1, col=10) that poses a threat if the avatar comes into direct contact.\n\nSince the avatar position has not changed from the last state, we need to analyze the best action. The avatar can move left (to row=4, col=1), down (to row=5, col=2) or right (to row=4, col=3).\n\nTo begin with, moving down to (row=5, col=2) seems advantageous as it allows the avatar to navigate around the blocking structures while keeping potential interactions in mind. \nThe crates at (row=4, col=3) can also be used to eliminate nearby enemies.\n\nThus, the decision is to proceed downwards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down into a less constrained area seems to align with the strategy of managing space effectively and moving towards the goals more efficiently.",
