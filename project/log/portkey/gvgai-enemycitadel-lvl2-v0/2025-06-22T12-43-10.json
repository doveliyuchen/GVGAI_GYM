Players navigate through a grid-based environment while solving puzzles to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n- **Sprites:** The game uses different types of sprites, including the avatar (player character), obstacles (walls, boulders, crates), enemies, and goals to achieve.\n- **Movement:** The player avatar can move around the grid but cannot pass through walls. It can interact with crates and boulders, using them strategically to solve puzzles.\n- **Interactions:**  \n  - The avatar can bounce off boulders and crates.\n  - Boulders can interact with one another and with the environment, causing them to kill certain sprites (e.g., both the boulder and enemy in a round hole).\n  - Touching the goal sprite will yield a score increase and eliminate the avatar.\n  - Enemies inflict health damage when touched by the avatar.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to interact with different elements in the level to eliminate enemies (either through using boulders/crates or reaching the goal) while minimizing health loss and ultimately reaching the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n- **Win:** The player wins when all goal sprites are collected, indicated by their SpriteCounter reaching zero.\n- **Loss:** The player loses when their avatar's health points reach zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid:** Familiarize yourself with the layout. Knowing where walls, enemies, and goals are will help in planning movements and interactions.\n  \n2. **Strategic Use of Crates and Boulders:** \n   - Use crates to block or bounce enemies back or away from you.\n   - Position boulders near enemies or in holes for elimination but be cautious of where boulders will roll.\n\n3. **Health Management:** \n   - Avoid direct confrontation with enemies. Plan paths that minimize contact to preserve your health points.\n  \n4. **Focus on the Goal:** \n   - Maximize score by reaching the goal as quickly as possible while ensuring enemies and potential threats are dealt with safely.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:** Experiment with different interactions. If a movement leads to a bad outcome, analyze what went wrong and try a different approach.\n\n6. **Plan Your Moves:** Move strategically, considering that certain elements might block your path or interact in unexpected ways. \n\n7. **Interaction Order:** Some interactions undo others. For example, if a movement causes a boulder to destructively interact with other sprites, be aware of the cascading effects.\n\n8. **Enemy Management:** Utilize crates to create barriers between yourself and enemies to navigate around them safely or eliminate them strategically.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you'll be better positioned to navigate the obstacles, solve the puzzles effectively, and achieve the game\u2019s objectives without losing all your health points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> a\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
