Recognize key interactions that can help you advance.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boulders and Crates Effectively**:\n   - Use boulders to crush or deal with enemies; they can also manipulate the movement of crates and other objects.\n   - If you can, push boulders into roundholes to score points without putting yourself at risk, as it results in both the boulder and the enemy being eliminated.\n\n3. **Avoid Unnecessary Contact**:\n   - Steer clear of enemies when possible, as direct contact reduces your health. Use crates as barriers between you and enemies where possible.\n  \n4. **Manage Health**: Keep an eye on your health points as the game progresses. If you start nearing a lower health threshold, be more cautious and avoid risky moves.\n\n5. **Strategically Position Crates**: Use crates to maneuver around the level and to create obstacles for enemies or use them to push against the wall which will then yield beneficial outcomes (like getting rid of enemies).\n\n6. **Be Clever with Movement**: Take advantage of the \u2018bounceForward\u2019 mechanics by positioning crates and boulders strategically to move the avatar ahead without needing to engage with enemies.\n\n7. **Aim for Efficiency**: Try to maximize your score by positioning for multiple interactions at once, like having multiple enemies in one area where they can be eliminated together.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, focusing on careful movement, and using game mechanics to your advantage, you can increase your chances of successfully reaching the goal while maintaining your health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "To evaluate the current position of the avatar and determine the next action, we need to take into consideration the layout of the game world.\n\n### Current Position:\nThe avatar is located at row 4, column 3 (4, 3). \n\n### Surrounding Environment:\n- At (4, 3): avatar (`a`)\n- At (4, 2): empty (.)\n- At (4, 4): boulder (@)\n- At (4, 5): boulder (@)\n- Walls border the immediate environment above and below.\n\n### Strategic Insights:\n1. **Current Surroundings**: \n   - To the left (4, 2), there is an empty space which is open for movement.\n   - Both to the right (4, 4) and (4, 5) are boulders that could potentially be utilized, but the avatar cannot move past those boulders or interact with them without changing positions.\n\n2. **Objective**:\n   - The nearest goal is at (9, 12), but there are resources and enemies to consider along the path.\n   - There are enemies (`$`) below the avatar which, if contacted, will cost health points.\n\n### Next Action:\nThe first logical step is to move to the left (4, 2), as it keeps the avatar safe from enemy encounters immediately while allowing for potential next moves into the layout.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to explore options while avoiding contact with enemies. We will reassess the situation after this movement for further strategic planning.",
