It involves strategic movement of an avatar to interact with various elements in the game world while solving puzzles to reach a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game world consists of different sprite types that include walls, holes, the avatar, enemies, and interactive crates.\n   - **Immovable sprites**: Background, walls, holes, goal.\n   - **Moving sprites**: The avatar can move around the map but encounters limitations with immovable objects.\n   - **Passive sprites**: Crates and boulders that can alter the environment's layout when interacted with.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with crates, boulders, and enemies.\n   - Crates can cause bouncing effects and can eliminate other sprites when positioned correctly (e.g., against holes).\n   - Encounters with enemies reduce the avatar\u2019s health, and if health reaches zero, the game is lost.\n\n3. **Score System**:\n   - Points are earned by successfully navigating and interacting with the environment (e.g., pushing crates into holes) and reaching the goal.\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the level, managing interactions strategically to eliminate obstacles (enemies or holes with crates) while ensuring health is preserved.\n- The ultimate goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which indicates completion of the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal, and all goal sprites are cleared from the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the avatar's health points drop to zero, usually as a result of enemy encounters or being crushed.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Understand the layout of the level well. The walls, holes, and positions of enemies greatly affect movement and interactions.\n  \n2. **Enemy Management**: Avoid enemies when possible, as contact reduces health. Utilize crates to push enemies away or eliminate them by trapping them against holes or walls.\n\n3. **Utilize Crates and Boulders**: Use crates to bounce against walls or create pathways to move around obstacles. Look for opportunities to eliminate both enemies and obstacles by combining crates with holes.\n\n4. **Health Preservation**: Always monitor the avatar's health and take extra precautions to avoid enemy contact. If health gets low, prioritize safe routes that minimize interactions.\n\n5. **Planning Moves**: Consider multiple steps ahead before performing any action. Some interactions can lead to unintended consequences (like bouncing into an enemy), so strategizing movements is vital.\n\n6. **Score Optimization**: Aim to maximize your score through successful interactions. Eliminate as many enemies as possible with crates to boost your points while keeping in mind that some moves might jeopardize health.\n\nBy employing these strategies while keeping an eye on both the avatar\u2019s health and the goal's position, players can navigate effectively through the challenges laid out in the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "To determine the appropriate action for the avatar currently located at (2, 3), we need to analyze the game state based on the rules established and map provided.\n\n### Current Position and Surroundings:\n- **Current Position**: Avatar 'a' is at (2, 3).\n- **Adjacent Positions**:\n  - (1, 3) -> '.' (Empty space)\n  - (3, 3) -> '.' (Empty space)\n  - (2, 2) -> '.' (Empty space)\n  - (2, 4) -> '.' (Empty space)\n\n### Potential Actions:\nSince the avatar can move up, down, left, or right, let's review what happens if we choose each direction:\n1. **Moving Left (2, 2)**: This position is free (empty space), and movement will change the position.\n2. **Moving Right (2, 4)**: This position is also free (empty space), and movement will change the position.\n3. **Moving Down (3, 3)**: This position is free, movement will change the position.\n4. **Moving Up (1, 3)**: This position is free, movement will change the position.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nSince the surrounding tiles are free and do not contain any enemies or holes, any move would be valid. However, following a strategy to keep the avatar positioned effectively is crucial. \n\n### Suggested Action:\nI will opt to move **Right** to (2, 4) since it unblocks more potential options for navigating around the nearby walls and obstacles in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to enhance my positional advantage and prepare for further strategic movements without immediate threats.",
