    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules and level layout you've provided, here's a breakdown of the game's various aspects:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-adventure** or **puzzle-platformer**. Players must solve spatial challenges while interacting with various objects to progress, combined with an avatar that can be moved around the game world.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Movement**: The player controls a moving avatar that has health points and can interact with different sprites (objects).\n2. **Interactivity**: \n   - **Boulders** and **Crates** can be pushed around and used to kill enemies or manipulate the environment.\n   - **Holes** (round & square) can act as traps for the player or tools for defeating enemies when boulders are placed in them.\n   - **Walls** block movement and serve as barriers.\n3. **Enemies**: NPCs (enemies) can physically harm the player upon contact, which can reduce health points.\n4. **Goal Mechanic**: The player must reach a positioned goal sprite to achieve victory.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The main objective is to reach the **goal** sprite while effectively managing health and navigating the level.\n- The player must avoid losing all health points or getting trapped/injured by enemies.\n- There are points to be collected through interactions with crates and holes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the health points of the avatar reach zero.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify walls, enemy locations, and potential traps (hole sprites) before moving.\n2. **Conserve Health**: Avoid unnecessary contact with enemies. Use crates to push enemies away and keep yourself safe.\n3. **Utilize Boulders and Crates**: Use boulders and crates effectively:\n   - Move them into holes to clear enemies, allowing safer paths and points.\n   - Create barriers with crates to protect yourself or to trap enemies.\n4. **Strategic Movement**: Plan movements carefully, moving in such a way that minimizes exposure to enemies while maximizing interaction options with crates and boulders.\n5. **Focus on the Goal**: Prioritize reaching the goal sprite when it's safe, ensuring paths are clear and health is managed.\n6. **Use Points Wisely**: If points are collectable through specific interactions, aim to achieve as many kills as possible without putting yourself in dangerous situations.\n\nBy combining effective navigation with strategic interactions of environment sprites, players can solve puzzles and reach the goal efficiently while maintaining health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar ('a') is located at (4, 4). I need to analyze the surrounding area to determine my next action.\n\n### Surrounding Layout:\n- Up (3, 4) has a boulder ('@').\n- Down (5, 4) has a round hole ('&').\n- Left (4, 3) is empty ('.').\n- Right (4, 5) has a boulder ('@').\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. Moving **up** to (3, 4) would place me on a boulder, which doesn't change my position to something I can interact with.\n2. Moving **down** to (5, 4) allows me to occupy a square with a round hole.\n3. Moving **left** to (4, 3) would be a safe move to an empty space.\n4. Moving **right** to (4, 5) would also place me on a boulder.\n\n### Analysis:\nMoving Down (to (5, 4)) seems most strategic because I can occupy a hole, which could potentially be useful for clearing enemies later, and could create alternate paths as I can further investigate the level's structure.\n\nI'll proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis move aligns with the strategy of utilizing the environment for navigation, and I expect that moving down provides more options for further actions and exploration.",
