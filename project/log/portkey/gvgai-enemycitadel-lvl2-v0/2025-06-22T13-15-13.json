Players navigate through a confined space, interacting with various objects (sprites) to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various types (background, holes, avatar, goal, crates, boulders, enemies, walls) provide a diverse set of interactions.\n2. **Movement**: The player controls an \"avatar\" that can move around the environment and interact with other sprites (like crates and enemies).\n3. **Interactivity**: The game's mechanics revolve around pushing and bouncing crates and boulders. Different interactions lead to different outcomes:\n   - Boulders can bounce off the avatar and other objects.\n   - Crates can be moved by the avatar and can interact with other crates for combinations and collisions.\n   - Certain actions lead to scoring points by \u201ckilling\u201d sprites (removing them from the game) in specific ways (e.g., when encountering holes or interacting with enemies).\n4. **Health Points**: The avatar has health points that can be reduced through encounters with enemies, introducing a survival aspect to the game.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate through a level using strategic movements and interactions to reach the \"goal\" sprite while potentially collecting points by eliminating certain sprites (like enemies or crates in specific situations). The goal sprite leads to a score change and could signify the completion of the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal, removing it from play (SpriteCounter for goal reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points reach zero (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Positioning**: Carefully position the avatar to avoid health loss from enemies while strategizing the movement of boulders and crates.\n2. **Utilize Crates and Boulders**: Use crates and boulders to eliminate enemies or interact with holes. Strategically pushing them into enemies or holes could maximize point gain.\n3. **Avoid Conflicts**: Steer clear of enemies as they can reduce your health, diminishing your chances of winning. Dive into mechanics around the enemy interactions to find safe paths.\n4. **Plan Moves**: Each level requires thoughtful planning of which sprites to interact with and how to manipulate their positions. Create a sequence of movements that can maximize damage to enemies or lead to the goal efficiently.\n5. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health points and be tactical about engagements; if a health loss is imminent, preserve health by avoiding certain interactions when possible.\n\nBy adapting these strategies while navigating the game's levels, players can successfully solve puzzles and achieve the ultimate goal of reaching the specified exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

Moving left and right also lead to empty spaces.\n\nTo maintain proactive gameplay and situate my avatar for future moves, I will choose to move **up** to (2, 3). This keeps my options open for further interactions in the subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nI expect this move will allow me to assess the next steps clearly, preparing for interactions while avoiding immediate threats.",
