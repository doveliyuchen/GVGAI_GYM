    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's mechanics, objectives, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to be a puzzle-platformer with elements of action. Players control a character (the avatar) that needs to navigate a level while solving spatial puzzles involving environmental objects like boulders, crates, holes, and enemies.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites/Elements**:\n   - **Avatar**: The main character that the player controls, with a health pool of 30.\n   - **Walls**: Immoveable barriers that limit movement.\n   - **Holes**: Two types of holes (square and round) that serve as traps for certain interactions.\n   - **Crates and Boulders**: Passive objects that can be used to interact with other elements like walls, the goal, and enemies.\n   - **Enemies**: Moving threats that can damage the avatar and disrupt movement.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can step back from walls and holes.\n   - Crates can bounce off one another and can also push the avatar backwards.\n   - Specifically, crates and boulders can kill certain sprites and change the score when interacting with holes.\n   - Interaction with the goal results in score gain, while contact with the enemy reduces health.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The primary goal is to eliminate all goals (represented by the \"goal\" sprite) on the level by interacting with crates and boulders to successfully navigate through traps and avoid enemies.\n- The player needs to maintain the avatar's health while solving puzzles to reach the goal.\n  \n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- The game is won if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero, indicating all goals have been achieved.\n- The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify where crates, boulders, enemies, and holes are located.\n  \n2. **Utilizing Crates and Boulders**: Use crates and boulders strategically to manipulate enemy positions and create pathways. When boulders or crates interact with holes, they can eliminate them which is essential to complete the level.\n  \n3. **Avoiding Enemies**: Prioritize avoiding enemies, as they can directly reduce your health. Keep distance and use crates to create barriers if needed.\n  \n4. **Plan Your Moves**: Since multiple interactions can happen, plan sequences of movements to achieve maximum progress per turn, like using crates to bounce into enemies or holes effectively.\n\n5. **Health Management**: Monitor your health closely and avoid unnecessary confrontations. Use the environment as much as possible to avoid damage.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim to maximize your score through calculated interactions, which means looking for opportunities where you can eliminate multiple holes or enemies in one move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy understanding the interactive nature of the game and carefully planning the avatar's movements, players can effectively solve the puzzles while minimizing health loss, ultimately achieving the game\u2019s objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "Analyzing the current state of the game, my avatar ('a') is located at position (1, 4). The objective is to eliminate all goals ('g') on the level while avoiding enemies ('e'), and I need to successfully navigate through the map without losing health.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the immediate surrounding area:\n\n- To the left (1, 3) is empty ('.').\n- To the right (1, 5) is also empty ('.').\n- Down (2, 4) has a boulder ('@').\n- Up (0, 4) has a wall ('b').\n\nSince I cannot move up or diagonal and the only object I can push is a boulder that is directly below me, I would have to look for a nearby interaction after I move. Looking for a closer goal, the closest goal ('%') is located at (9, 12), which is quite far from my current position. \n\nHence, since I cannot push the boulder this turn as it won't change my position, I will take an action to explore and get a better position. \n\nI will move **right** to (1, 5) to have more options on the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis move should help extend my movement options for the next turn and allow me to plan further actions wisely. My expectation is to reassess the layout and interactions available after this movement.",
