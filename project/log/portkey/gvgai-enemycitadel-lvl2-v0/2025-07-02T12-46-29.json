    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer, where players navigate through obstacles, use interactions strategically, and solve puzzles to progress towards a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various types of sprites include immovable wall sprites, moving avatars, passive crates and boulders, goals, and enemies.\n2. **Movement**: The player controls an 'avatar' that can move around the level. Certain objects can be pushed or interacted with, such as crates and boulders.\n3. **Damage and Health**: The avatar has health points (30) and can lose health when interacting with enemies. Conversely, enemies are affected by specific types of interactions with the avatar and other objects.\n4. **Interactions**: There are mechanics for bouncing back, stepping back, and killing sprites, with consequences like bouncing forward or losing health points.\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary objective of the game is to reach the 'goal' sprite while avoiding damage from enemies.\n- Players score points through specific interactions, such as killing other sprites (crates or boulders in designated conditions).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the 'goal' sprite, which results in scoring 5 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the player\u2019s avatar\u2019s health points reach zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Environmental Awareness**: Be mindful of the layout and the various interactions available with crates, boulders, and enemies. Understanding the environment helps in planning moves.\n  \n2. **Utilize Crates and Boulders**: Use crates and boulders effectively to manipulate the flow of the game. For instance, boulders can kill enemies or clear paths, while crates can help block enemies or assist in achieving score-completion objectives.\n\n3. **Avoid Damage**: Prioritize avoiding enemy contact. Plan movements carefully to navigate around enemies, or use crates and boulders to create barriers.\n\n4. **Pathways to Goals**: Identify clear pathways to the goal, utilizing safe routes and leveraging interactions of sprites to safely reach the objective without losing health.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: Look for opportunities to engage in score-increasing interactions, such as killing sprites under specific conditions before moving towards the goal.\n\nBy effectively navigating the level using the game\u2019s mechanics and strategic item placement, players can maximize their chances of winning while minimizing health loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> a\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> @\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> $\nrow=9, col=2 -> #\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> @\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> %\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game and the position of the avatar at (4, 2), I need to determine a strategic action to avoid enemies, maximize scoring opportunities, and hopefully reach the goal at (9, 12).\n\nHere's the current setup around the avatar:\n- Row 4: `...@...@...#...#...`\n- Adjacent positions:\n  - Up (3, 2): Empty space\n  - Down (5, 2): Round hole ('&')\n  - Left (4, 1): Empty space\n  - Right (4, 3): Boulder ('@')\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n1. Moving downward to the round hole may allow access to potential new paths.\n2. Other directions either lead to nothing or solid obstacles.\n3. I need to be cautious as the current enemy is at (9, 1) which is two rows down.\n   \nFor the next action, I will choose **ACTION_DOWN** to explore the hole and check what is available further.\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\n\nThis action seems reasonable to explore new paths while avoiding immediate threats. I expect to potentially find a new strategic direction or possibility for interacting with the environment.",
