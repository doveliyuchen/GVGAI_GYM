The gameplay involves strategizing movements and interactions with environmental objects (such as walls, boxes, and holes) to achieve a specific outcome.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** There are different types of sprites including immovable elements (like walls, floors, and holes), a moving avatar (the player-controlled character), and passive boxes that the player can interact with.\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move within the environment, but there are restrictions when it interacts with walls (it steps back) or boxes (it bounces forward).\n- **Interactivity:** The primary interactions involve bouncing boxes off walls and using boxes to push them into holes to eliminate them from the game. This leads to scoring and achieving the win condition.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal of the game is to remove all the boxes from the level. This is achieved by pushing the boxes into holes. The game ends successfully when there are no boxes left.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the counter for the boxes reaches zero (i.e., all boxes have been pushed into holes).\n- **Loss Condition:** There are no explicit loss conditions mentioned in the rules. However, a player can potentially become stuck or unable to progress if they mismanage box placements or movement, which is a common challenge in puzzle games.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Before making any moves, survey the layout carefully to understand box positions and potential routes. Think several steps ahead about how each move will affect the position of the boxes and your avatar.\n\n2. **Use the Walls Wisely:** When moving the avatar, use the walls to your advantage. Keep in mind that interacting with walls will send you back, so avoid inadvertently trapping yourself or making moves that undo progress.\n\n3. **Focus on Box Placement:** Directly target the boxes and work to position them so that they can be pushed into the holes. This may involve strategic bouncing; consider how each box's position affects nearby boxes and your ability to move them.\n\n4. **Try to Eliminate Boxes Sequentially:** Target boxes that are isolated or near holes first, as they can be removed with fewer moves compared to those blocked by walls or other boxes.\n\n5. **Avoid Isolating Yourself:** Ensure that while you play, you do not create conditions where you cannot reach certain boxes due to walls or other boxes blocking paths. Keeping open pathways for movement is crucial for continued progress.\n\nOverall, careful planning and foresight into the consequences of each action help optimize the puzzle-solving experience and increase your chances of successfully clearing the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> 0\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> 0\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
