    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, a Sokoban-like pushing puzzle)\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The player, represented by the 'avatar', can push 'box' sprites.\n*   **Movement Restrictions:** The 'avatar' cannot pass through 'wall' sprites.\n*   **Object Interaction:** 'box' sprites interact with other sprites in specific ways\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary goal is to eliminate all 'box' sprites from the level.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The player wins when there are no more 'box' sprites remaining (SpriteCounter box limit=0 win=True).\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   There does not appear to be a loss condition based on these rules. It is possible to get stuck, but the game doesn't explicitly state a loss.\n\n**Sprite Summary:**\n\n*   **avatar:** The player-controlled character that can move and push boxes.\n*   **box:** Pushable objects. Can be destroyed by pushing them into a 'hole'.\n*   **hole:** A destination or target. When a 'box' sprite is pushed into it, the box disappears, and the player likely gets points.\n*   **wall:** Impassable obstacles that restrict movement.\n*   **floor:** The background on which the player moves\n**Interaction Summary:**\n*   **avatar wall > stepBack**: Avatar attempts to walk into a wall, avatar moves back\n*   **box avatar > bounceForward**: Avatar attempts to walk into a box, avatar moves forward to push the box\n*   **box wall box > undoAll**: It looks like if a box is sandwiched between a wall and a box, the game will rewind.\n*   **box hole > killSprite scoreChange=1**: If the box is pushed into the hole, the box is removed and the player gets one point.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   'w' represents 'wall' sprites, forming the level's boundaries and internal obstacles.\n*   'A' represents the starting position of the 'avatar'.\n*   '0' represents 'hole' sprites.\n*   '1' represents 'box' sprites.\n*   '.' likely represents 'floor' sprites.\n\n**General Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban games require careful planning. Before making a move, visualize the consequences.\n2.  **Avoid Cornering Boxes:** Be extremely careful not to push a 'box' sprite into a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved again. This will likely make the level unsolvable.\n3.  **Prioritize Problem Boxes:** Identify 'box' sprites that are in difficult positions early on and try to solve those first.\n4.  **Utilize Available Space:** Think about how the available free space can be used to maneuver 'box' sprites into the correct positions.\n5.  **Hole Prioritization:** Plan a route to push the boxes into the hole\n\nIn essence, this is a classic puzzle game where careful planning and spatial reasoning are essential for success. The limited interactions create a simple ruleset that can lead to complex and challenging puzzles.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> 0\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> a\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> 0\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
