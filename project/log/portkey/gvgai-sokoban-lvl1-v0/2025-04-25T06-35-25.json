The presence of immovable sprites, interactions between the avatar and boxes, and the objective of manipulating these components to achieve a goal suggests a classic puzzle format.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - **Floor**: An immovable base (the ground).\n   - **Wall**: Acts as an obstacle; the avatar cannot pass through.\n   - **Hole**: Serves as a trap; if a box falls into it, it's removed from play and the player gains a point.\n   - **Box**: Can be moved by the avatar and can interact with walls or holes through the avatar's actions.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and interact with boxes.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls (it steps back).\n   - The avatar can push boxes forward (they bounce back).\n   - Boxes can be pushed into each other against walls, causing all boxes to revert to their previous positions (undoAll).\n   - If a box moves into the hole, it is removed from the game, and the player gains a point (score change).\n\n### Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n- The objective is to remove all boxes from the play area by getting them into the hole. The specific condition for winning is that the sprite counter for boxes (stype=box) must reach a limit of 0; this indicates all boxes have been successfully moved into the hole.\n- The game does not mention specific loss conditions, so it seems designed around problem-solving rather than failing. However, the player may encounter challenges in manipulating the boxes without accidentally causing a situation that blocks further progress.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements**: Before making any moves, assess the positions of all boxes regarding the walls and the hole. Use visual spatial reasoning to determine which boxes can be moved directly into the hole and which need to be repositioned first.\n\n2. **Utilize Box Bouncing**: When interacting with boxes, utilize their bounce mechanic strategically. This can create opportunities to move boxes closer to the hole in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **Avoid Blockages**: Work to maintain pathways between boxes and ensure that moving one box doesn't inadvertently block others from reaching the hole. Plan movements in rounds, ensuring that each action brings you closer to removing boxes.\n\n4. **Use Trial and Error**: If a move doesn\u2019t work out as planned, consider it a learning opportunity. Since the game mechanics allow for the repositioning of boxes via bounce interactions, players should experiment with various configurations without fear of immediate loss.\n\n5. **Goal-Oriented Moves**: Aim to clear boxes in clusters when possible, rather than focusing on one at a time, especially if it seems to lead to a more complicated configuration or if it risks blockage.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can effectively navigate the puzzle, removing boxes from the field and achieving victory by making the optimal moves towards the game's objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nww.@@a.....ww\nwwww.......ww\nwwww.0......w\nwwww........w\nw......w.wwww\nw..0.......0w\nw..........@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...wwwww\nw...www.w\nw.0.www@w\nw......@w\nw....0.aw\nw.......w\nw..w....w\nw.......w\nw..w....w\nw..w....w\nw@0w..www\nwwwwwwwww",

    "content": "In the current state, the avatar ('a') is positioned in the second row of the level, surrounded by boxes ('@') and with walls ('w') around. There are holes ('0') in some locations that can be used to score points by pushing boxes into them.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar is at position (2, 3) in the original state, surrounded by boxes.\n- There are two holes at positions (3, 3) and (5, 3).\n- The nearest box ('@') to the avatar can be pushed to the right (to the hole at (3, 3)).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Actions:\n1. **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: \n   - This would move the avatar to position (2, 4), which is a floor block (.) and would allow the avatar to push the box into the hole at (3, 3) on the next move.\n   \n2. **Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: \n   - This would move the avatar to position (2, 2), blocked by a wall, hence not a viable action.\n\n3. **Down (ACTION_DOWN)**:\n   - This would move the avatar to position (3, 3), directly on the hole (0). However, the avatar cannot step into a hole or perform interactions there without first pushing a box.\n\n4. **Up (ACTION_UP)**:\n   - This would move the avatar to position (1, 3), which is still surrounded and doesn\u2019t help in pushing boxes.\n\n### Best Action Choice:\n- Moving **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** will allow the avatar to prepare for the next action of pushing the box into the hole.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect that moving to the right will position the avatar for a subsequent successful interaction with the box and align with the strategy to clear boxes efficiently.",
