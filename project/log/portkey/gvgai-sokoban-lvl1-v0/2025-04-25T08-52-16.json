It involves strategic placement and movement of game elements (the \"box\") to achieve a specific outcome.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: The static ground on which the game elements exist.\n   - **Hole**: A static sprite that can be \"killed\" by placing a box in it, resulting in a score change.\n   - **Avatar**: A dynamic element controlled by the player, which can move around the level.\n   - **Box**: A movable passive object that interacts with the avatar and other elements.\n   - **Wall**: An immovable obstacle that can block the avatar's movement and restrict the repositioning of the box.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The **avatar** cannot move through walls and will step back if it collides with one.\n   - When **the avatar** collides with a **box**, it causes the box to bounce forward.\n   - If a **box** collides with a **wall**, any previously moved boxes will return to their original positions (undoAll).\n   - Placing a box into a **hole** results in a box being removed from the level (killed) and increases the player's score by 1.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to manipulate the boxes within the level to ensure that all boxes are placed in the holes (killed) before reaching a specified limit. The victory condition is met when there are no boxes left in the level (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0), indicating that all have been successfully placed into their holes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when all boxes are removed from the level by placing them into holes (achieved through the SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: Although a specific lose condition isn't stated directly, one can infer that if the player cannot make progress (e.g. all viable moves lead to dead ends or if movement is restricted), they may become unable to achieve the win condition.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Moves**: Assess the layout of the level including the locations of walls, boxes, and holes. Plan the sequence of moves to successfully navigate the avatar around obstacles to get the boxes into the holes.\n   \n2. **Controlled Movement**: Use the bouncing mechanic wisely. Move the avatar to bounce boxes in the direction of holes while avoiding collisions with walls, which would undo progress.\n\n3. **Minimize Bounces**: Try to limit the number of times the avatar has to bounce a box to avoid potential complications from the undo actions that result from hitting a wall.\n\n4. **Utilize Space**: Make sure to use the available floor space efficiently, ensuring that the path to holes is always accessible without being blocked by walls or other boxes.\n\n5. **Backtrack Judiciously**: If a certain move seems to lead to a dead-end situation, don't hesitate to backtrack to re-evaluate the state of the level and try a different approach.\n\nBy following these strategic principles, players can better manipulate the game environment and successfully navigate the challenges presented in this puzzle scenario.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

Moving down into the box (2, 5) could utilize the box as a means to facilitate future moves and manipulate its position. Here are the considerations:\n\n- Moving **Left**: This creates no opportunity and keeps my position standing without any interaction.\n- Moving **Right**: Again, this just allows me to move into empty space without useful follow-up.\n- Moving **Up**: Keeps me vacantly above while not interacting with neighboring elements.\n- Moving **Down**: Will lead to an interaction with the box, potentially enabling me to make further movements afterward.\n\n### Proposed Action\n```Action: 3```\n\nBy moving down to (2, 5), I will be interacting with the box (@), which is crucial for progress in the puzzle. I anticipate a more dynamic next move with additional options opened for me to consider in the upcoming turns!",

Hence I will take the step:\n\n```Action: 2```\n\nBy moving right to (2, 6) and engaging with the box (@), I expect to use its position for further strategic moves in the next steps!",
