    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing Puzzles:** The core mechanic revolves around pushing boxes.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Players need to figure out the correct sequence of moves to get the boxes into the holes.\n*   **Limited Movement:** Due to walls and the fact that boxes can only be pushed (not pulled), movement is constrained, requiring careful planning.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary objective is to eliminate all the boxes by pushing them into the holes.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The player wins when there are no boxes left on the level (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`).\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   There's no explicit loss condition mentioned in the rules. However, the player can get stuck if they push a box into a corner or against a wall such that it cannot be moved further. This would effectively make the level unwinnable, acting as a soft loss.\n\n**Sprite Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Avatar (A):** The player-controlled character that can move around the level and push boxes.\n*   **Box (1):** A pushable object that needs to be moved into a hole.\n*   **Hole (0):** The target destination for the boxes. When a box enters a hole, the box disappears and the player gets a score.\n*   **Wall (w):** An impassable barrier for both the avatar and boxes.\n*   **Floor (.):** The walkable area.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   **Confined Space:** The level layout is relatively small and enclosed by walls, adding to the challenge.\n*   **Multiple Boxes and Holes:** There are multiple boxes and holes, indicating that the puzzle involves strategic planning to match boxes to holes in the correct order.\n*   **Starting Position:** The avatar starts near one corner of the level, while the boxes and holes are scattered around.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Before making any moves, carefully analyze the level and identify potential bottlenecks or areas where boxes could get stuck. Visualize the sequence of pushes needed for each box.\n2.  **Prioritize Accessible Boxes:** Focus on moving boxes that are easily accessible first. This might open up pathways to reach other boxes.\n3.  **Avoid Cornering Boxes:** Be extremely careful not to push boxes into corners where they cannot be moved. This often leads to an unsolvable state.\n4.  **Consider Hole Placement:** Take into account the position of the holes relative to the boxes. Some holes might be easier to reach than others.\n5.  **Look for Undo Opportunities (advanced):** If the undoAll rule is triggered by a box being wedged between a wall and another box, this could be used to correct mistakes. This strategy is risky because it requires another box and a wall.\n6.  **Restart When Necessary:** If you realize you've made a mistake that makes the level unsolvable, don't hesitate to restart.\n\nIn short, this game is a classic box-pushing puzzle where careful planning and spatial reasoning are key to success. The absence of an explicit loss condition puts even more pressure on the player, as they must avoid making irreversible mistakes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> 0\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> 0\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
