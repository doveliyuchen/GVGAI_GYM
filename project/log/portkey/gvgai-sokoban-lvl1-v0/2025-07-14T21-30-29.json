It involves navigating through a space, interacting with objects (sprites), and solving challenges to progress.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent the environment and entities:\n   - **Floor**: The ground or surface the avatar moves on.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous spots that can lead to a loss.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move around.\n   - **Boxes**: Passive objects that can be interacted with to influence movement.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable boundaries that the avatar cannot cross.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls but will step back if it collides with one.\n   - When the avatar touches a box, it bounces forward.\n   - Boxes that collide with walls revert to their original positions.\n   - Boxes falling into holes result in a loss for the player (but net a score change). \n\n#### Objective\nThe main goal of the game is to manipulate the boxes in such a way that all of them fall into the holes before the sprite counter for boxes reaches zero (indicating there are no more boxes left). If all boxes are successfully placed in holes, the player wins the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully getting all boxes into holes (box counter = 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: If a box goes into a hole, it signifies a score (but at the same time, loss for the player in terms of resource).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movement**: Before executing moves, consider the layout of the level and plan which boxes can easily be moved into holes. Keep an eye on how many boxes are present and their locations.\n\n2. **Use Bouncing Effect**: Leverage the avatar\u2019s ability to bounce off boxes efficiently to reposition them toward the holes. Consider the trajectory of each box after it bounces.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Be careful not to inadvertently send boxes into holes without a strategic plan, as doing so reduces the number of boxes available and may lead to failure.\n\n4. **Puzzle Solutions**: Look for combinations of movements that allow you to manipulate multiple boxes at once. This might involve using walls and other boxes to create a chain reaction.\n\n5. **Focus on Grouping**: If possible, group boxes near holes so that subsequent moves can be executed quickly. This saves time and reduces the risk of sending a box into a hole prematurely.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics and layout, players can develop a strategy that combines thoughtful positioning with careful execution to succeed in emptying the level of boxes strategically.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> 0\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> 0\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> a\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The primary goal is to manipulate the boxes ('1' or '@') so that they fall into the holes ('0') without leaving any behind.\n\n### Current Analysis\n- The avatar is positioned on a row filled with floor ('.'), which gives me space to move.\n- There are two boxes nearby: one at (row 5, col 1) and the other at (row 5, col 8).\n- The closest hole is at (row 6, col 3) directly above the avatar's current position.\n\n### Strategy Based on Current State\n1. **Move Upward**: The immediate step is to move the avatar up to (row 6, col 3), which will put it right next to the hole. From there, I can then plan the next steps, such as attempting to move a box towards the hole.\n\nGiven that no immediate action can be taken this turn to move any boxes into holes since the boxes are further down and the avatar is in position to move up next to a hole, I will perform the action of moving up.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is intended to position the avatar next to a hole, setting up for a subsequent strategic move.",
