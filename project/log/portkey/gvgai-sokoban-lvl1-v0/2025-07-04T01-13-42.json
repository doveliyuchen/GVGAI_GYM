    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules provided, here\u2019s an analysis of the game:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Core Mechanics\n\u2003\u2013 Genre: It\u2019s a puzzle game with block-pushing elements, similar in spirit to Sokoban but with a physics twist.\n\u2003\u2013 Mechanics: The player controls an avatar that can move around and push boxes. When the avatar bumps into a box, the box \u201cbounces forward\u201d (moves further along its path). The environment contains immovable walls and floors, and there are \u201choles\u201d on the floor. If a pushed box goes into a hole, it is removed (using the \u201ckillSprite\u201d action) and the player gains a point. There\u2019s also an interaction with walls that, if a box hits a wall (potentially in combination with another box), it triggers an \u201cundo\u201d of prior moves. This adds a layer of challenge by punishing imprecise pushes.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: The main goal is to eliminate all boxes \u2013 you do this by getting them to fall into holes.\n\u2003\u2013 Win Condition: The level is won when there are zero boxes remaining (as checked by the SpriteCounter for boxes).\n\u2003\u2013 Loss/Punishment: Although there isn\u2019t an explicit loss condition described (like time running out or a specific death mechanic), making a wrong move (such as pushing boxes incorrectly so they bounce off walls or undo moves) can force you to restart your strategic sequence.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\u20031. Plan your moves: Since the win condition depends on disposing all boxes by placing them in holes, begin by examining the level layout to figure out which boxes can be pushed to which holes with minimal repositioning.\n\u20032. Anticipate the bounce: The \u201cbounceForward\u201d reaction means that when your avatar interacts with a box, it won\u2019t just nudge it; the box will keep moving in that direction. Time your pushes so that the box lands in a hole, and be aware of obstacles like walls that might cause feedback.\n\u20033. Avoid traps: The \u201cundoAll\u201d rule triggered by box-wall interactions suggests that if a box is pushed into a wall in the wrong way, you might have to reverse your moves. Try to steer clear of moves that risk unpredictable bounces or collisions with walls.\n\u20034. Use the environment: The level is built with walls that limit movement. Exploit these boundaries to control where a bouncing box goes. Sometimes, letting a wall \u201cstep back\u201d your avatar might help reposition yourself for a better push.\n\u20035. Experiment and learn: Given the physics-driven moves (boxes bouncing and possible undo actions), you may need to experiment with different angles and push strengths to get the desired outcome without triggering undo events.\n\nIn summary, the game is a puzzle challenge where careful planning and precise control of the avatar are key to pushing boxes into holes. Every move must be carefully considered because not only do you have to aim the box correctly, but you must also manage the possibility of moves being undone if the box collides badly with a wall. Success comes from thinking ahead, controlling your movement, and using the environment to your advantage.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> 0\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> 0\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
