Game Genre and Objective:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a puzzle game that involves spatial manipulation of objects.\n\u2003\u2022 Your goal is to clear the level by eliminating all the boxes. Boxes are removed (or \u201ckilled\u201d) when they interact with holes. The win condition is met once there are zero boxes left on the board.\n\n2. Core Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 You control an avatar (the knight) that moves around the level.\n\u2003\u2022 The level consists of floors, walls, boxes, and holes. Walls and floors are immovable, establishing the level\u2019s structure.\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes are passive objects that can be pushed around. When they interact with holes, they\u2019re removed from play (with a score bonus).\n\u2003\u2022 If the avatar bumps into walls, they step back, preventing the avatar from going through obstacles.\n\u2003\u2022 When boxes bump into the avatar, the box bounces forward\u2014which could be used to push a box into a hole.\n\u2003\u2022 There is a special interaction where a box colliding with a wall and then with another box (or vice versa) triggers an \u201cundo all,\u201d likely resetting or canceling an unwanted move. This means you must be cautious with how boxes are positioned and moved, as improper pushes might undo your progress.\n\n3. Level Layout:\n\u2003\u2022 The level is bordered by walls (denoted by \u201cw\u201d), with the avatar (denoted by \u201cA\u201d) starting close to the top.\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes (likely marked with numerical symbols like \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d) and holes are scattered throughout, requiring careful planning to maneuver boxes to the correct targets.\n\u2003\u2022 The arrangement suggests tight corridors and obstacles that demand thoughtful movement planning.\n\n4. Gameplay Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Your Moves: Think ahead about how each push will move a box. Make sure that boxes are heading towards holes rather than getting wedged against walls or other boxes.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the BounceForward Mechanic: Since boxes bounce when they interact with the avatar, use your avatar deliberately to guide boxes in the right direction.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Chain Collisions: Be wary of interactions that involve multiple boxes or boxes hitting walls that could trigger the undo condition. If boxes touch a wall and another box in the wrong way, it might cancel your moves, so set up clean, deliberate pushes.\n\u2003\u2022 Clear One Box at a Time: Focus on eliminating one box by getting it into a hole before moving on to the next, to reduce the complexity of maneuvers.\n\u2003\u2022 Master Spatial Awareness: Because the layout is tight and the interactions are rigid (with step-backs and bounces), always be mindful of your surroundings. Understand the paths available to both your avatar and the boxes so that accidental resets are avoided.\n\nBy combining these insights, a good overall strategy is to carefully plan and execute moves that methodically push boxes into holes without causing unintended collisions. Think ahead, move strategically, and use the specific collision behaviors (like bouncing and stepping back) to your advantage. This methodical approach will lead you to clear boxes one by one and win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> 0\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> 0\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> 0\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
