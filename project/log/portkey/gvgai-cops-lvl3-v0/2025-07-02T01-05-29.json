    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules provided, we can begin to break down the game into its key components:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fall into the **action-adventure** or **stealth** genre with elements of **platforming**, as it involves navigating through a space while avoiding or confronting enemies (thugs) and performing resource collection tasks.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Player Avatar**: The player controls an avatar (referred to as 'A'), which can move around the level.\n- **Enemies**: There are different types of thugs (red, green, yellow, and a boss) that the player needs to interact with. Some flee while others may lead to the player accumulating resources (villains).\n- **Collecting Resources**: The player can collect a 'key' resource, which is required to interact with the jaildoor and progress in the game.\n- **Interacting with the Environment**:\n  - The player can step back when colliding with walls or when thugs hit walls.\n  - The player can interact with the jaildoor, but only if they have the key.\n  - Collecting and defeating thugs adds resources (villains) to the player's inventory.\n- **Scoring**: Defeating specific thugs gives a player score points, with the red thug being significantly more valuable.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game seems to be:\n1. Collect resources, specifically killing thugs to gather red, green, and yellow villains.\n2. Access the jail by defeating enough thugs and collecting necessary resources (particularly the key).\n3. Defeat the boss to win the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by defeating the boss (making the sprite count for 'boss' zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if they run out of time (timeout limit of 1900) or possibly if they run out of resources (not explicitly stated but suggested by several interactions).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Collecting the Key**: Secure the key as early as possible, as it is required for progressing through the game. Check the depot for respawning keys if you are running low.\n  \n2. **Target Thugs Wisely**: Start by engaging with the thugs to maximize your resources. Each thug defeated gives you valuable resources to defeat further enemies. Focus on the thugs that yield the most villains, particularly red thugs first because they provide the most points.\n\n3. **Manage Resources**: Keep an eye on your villain resources. You\u2019ll need to generate costs before using them at the jail for spawning green, yellow, or red trans (which give good points).\n\n4. **Navigating Obstacles**: Use the walls to your advantage to avoid thugs and limit the scenarios where they might trap or kill you.\n\n5. **Focus on Boss**: Aim to fight the boss towards the end, after accumulating significant resources and points to ensure you can heal or regenerate if needed.\n\nBy executing this strategy and adapting to the dynamics of the in-game environment, players should be able to navigate the traps and enemy interactions effectively to achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
