The player likely takes on the role of an avatar navigating a 2D space filled with various obstacles and enemies.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features multiple sprites including walls, doors, thugs, and resources (keys and villains). Each sprite has specific properties and behaviors. For example, some are immovable, while others are interactive.\n- **Avatar Movement:** The player-controlled avatar can interact with different objects (e.g., collecting keys, triggering events).\n- **Fleeing Enemies:** The game has fleeing enemies (thugs), which the player must avoid or outmaneuver.\n- **Resource Management:** The player needs to collect keys and manage resources effectively (e.g., defeating villains to gain score and resources).\n- **Scoring System:** Players earn points by defeating specific enemies and making certain interactions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe player's main objective seems to be defeating the **boss** enemy while managing resources effectively, represented by the keys and villains encountered throughout the level. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the boss (sprite of type \"boss\") is defeated, as indicated by a `SpriteCounter` limit of 0 for the boss.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the time limit of 1900 units is reached without defeating the boss.\n\n### Overall Strategy Recommendations:\n1. **Resource Collection and Management:**\n   - Prioritize collecting keys to unlock doors, allowing access to strategic areas of the map.\n   - Keep an eye on the resources (red, green, yellow villains) you're collecting vs. what is required for victory.\n\n2. **Avoiding Enemies:**\n   - Use stealth and careful movement to avoid fleeing enemies (thugs) as they can interfere with your progress and may force you to step back.\n   - Familiarize yourself with the movement patterns of both thugs and the boss to navigate around them effectively.\n\n3. **Plan Movement Paths:**\n   - Identify key routes within the level layout that minimize encounters with enemies. Use walls to block line-of-sight and create safe paths to key objectives.\n   - Use the depot smartly to spawn needed resources (the key) while ensuring you are not overwhelmed by pursuing thugs.\n\n4. **Engage Enemies Wisely:**\n   - Only engage with thugs when necessary (to collect their corresponding villain resources), as this can help increase your score.\n   - Plan to defeat the boss at a time when you have enough resources and a clear escape route.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep track of the time limit and ensure you are progressing efficiently towards defeating the boss.\n   - Don\u2019t engage in excessive resource collection if it takes too long; focus on defeating the boss as a primary goal.\n\nBy combining resource management, enemy evasion, and strategic planning, players can successfully navigate the game and work towards defeating the boss within the given time limit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
