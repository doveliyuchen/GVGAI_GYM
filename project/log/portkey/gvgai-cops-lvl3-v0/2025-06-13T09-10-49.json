Players control an avatar (character) that navigates a grid-based environment, interacting with various objects and enemies to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites (characters and objects) that include:\n   - The player\u2019s avatar (a cop) and various villains (thugs) of different colors.\n   - Immoveable objects like walls, jail doors, and depots for collecting resources (keys).\n   - The presence of a boss character that the player must defeat.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can collect keys, engage with walls and the jail door, and change or interact with resources (like defeating thugs).\n   - Collecting keys is crucial for accessing jail doors and other areas.\n   - Defeating thugs rewards the player with resources (villains) that contribute to their score.\n\n3. **Scoring**: Players can earn points by defeating different villain types:\n   - Red villain gives 100 points.\n   - Yellow villain gives 5 points.\n   - Green villain gives 2 points.\n\n4. **Timed Objectives**: There is a timeout limit of 1900 seconds, which adds urgency to the player's actions, as they must achieve their goals within this constraint.\n\n#### Objective\nThe overall objective of the game is to defeat the boss sprite while managing resources and time effectively. Players need to gather keys and defeat the various thugs to progress and ultimately ensure the boss is the last enemy remaining on the screen.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the boss sprite is defeated (SpriteCounter limit for boss reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the timeout limit of 1900 seconds is reached without defeating the boss.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: \n   - Focus on collecting keys to unlock the jail door and access areas where thugs reside.\n   - Prioritize defeating red thugs as they provide the most points, helping to empower your score more rapidly.\n\n2. **Enemy Engagement**:\n   - Identify the locations of the different colored thugs on the map and target them strategically.\n   - Use walls to your advantage to step back from potential threats while planning your next moves.\n\n3. **Time Management**:\n   - Keep a constant reminder of the time limit; plan your movements efficiently to maximize your engagements with enemies and key resources.\n   - Don't get sidetracked; maintain focus on defeating the boss as your primary goal.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Carefully explore the map to understand the layout, especially the positioning of the depots and jails.\n   - Use the dungeon-like structure of the level to your advantage by finding optimal routes to avoid confrontations while allowing for strategic attacks.\n\n5. **Avoiding Overcrowding**:\n   - Since multiple thugs can be lurking in close proximity, try to engage them one at a time to avoid being overwhelmed and killed.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can increase their chances of efficiently defeating the boss while also maximizing their score. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

The nearby enemies, walls, a jail door ('&'), and depots are present in the environment. \n\nTo pursue the objective of defeating the boss ('@') at (1, 3), we must first gather resources and ensure we are adequately prepared for the fight. The nearest key depots ('#') are located at (13, 13), which we should consider accessing.\n\nSince the avatar hasn't moved and it is crucial to take action towards our goal, I will choose to move toward the depot to collect any keys available that could help unlock doors or bolster our strategic planning.\n\nExecuting the action:\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action is to move **DOWN** to (15, 12), aiming to explore further options while moving towards the depot for resource collection. I expect this aligns with our strategy of maximizing resources effectively.",
