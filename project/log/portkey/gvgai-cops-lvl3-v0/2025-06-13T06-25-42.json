Players control an avatar navigating a maze-like environment filled with threats and interactive objects.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites (Objects):** Includes walls, doors (jaildoors), characters (avatar, thugs, villains), key resources, and transport sprites. These sprites have specific properties and are immovable or movable depending on their type.\n- **Interactions:** The player can collect keys, face off against enemies (thugs and the boss), and interact with objects like the jail and depot. There are mechanics for spawning new sprites based on certain conditions.\n- **Resource Management:** Collecting keys is crucial. Only one key can be held at a time, and players need to manage their resources strategically to progress. Certain enemies transform into resources upon defeat.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary goal is to eliminate all instances of the boss sprite, while also managing resources such as keys and defeating various thugs. Players earn points by successfully managing these resources, interacting with the key, and defeating villains.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by defeating the boss (limit of 0 remaining) before time runs out.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the time runs out (1900 units) without defeating the boss.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Resource Management:** \n   - Prioritize obtaining the single available key as soon as possible. Use it efficiently for your progress.\n   - Be cautious with the jaildoor interaction; since it can kill the avatar if the resource count is managed poorly.\n\n2. **Avoiding Fights Initially:**\n   - Avoid engagement with the thugs at the start. Instead, focus on moving through the layout and gathering keys and resources. \n   - Only engage with the thugs when you are prepared and in a strategic position.\n\n3. **Utilizing Spawns:**\n   - After defeating a thug, be aware that it triggers the spawning of the respective villain. Use this to create a plan for managing and defeating each villain for points.\n\n4. **Movement and Navigation:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify paths and potential escape routes, especially when facing the more dangerous sprites, like the boss.\n   - Have escape routes prepared in case the thugs pursue you.\n\n5. **Prioritizing Boss Fight:**\n   - Once you've managed resources effectively, direct your efforts towards hunting down and killing the boss to secure a win in the time limit.\n\n6. **Points Optimization:**\n   - Target villains that grant higher points when defeated (like redvillain for a score change of 100) to maximize overall score and efficiency while ensuring you\u2019re managing your time well.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate the challenges presented by the game and improve their chances of winning efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
