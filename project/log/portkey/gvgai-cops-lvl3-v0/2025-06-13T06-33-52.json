    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game can be classified as an **action-adventure** or **maze/puzzle** game. It involves exploration, resource management, and strategic interactions with enemies and objects within a confined gameplay area represented by a grid or map.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various immovable and movable entities interact within the game. Key sprites include:\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character (a cop).\n  - **Thugs & Boss**: Enemies that must be dealt with.\n  - **Jail & Jaildoor**: Areas for interactions, potentially involving captures and obstacles.\n  - **Key**: A collectible resource needed to open the jaildoor.\n  \n- **Interactions**: The game relies on a series of interactions defined between the player avatar and other sprites:\n  - Collecting keys, defeating thugs, and managing the 'villains' as resources.\n  - Player actions can yield score changes based on resources collected or thugs defeated.\n\n- **Score System**: Players earn points by successfully defeating thugs and managing resources, with certain enemies providing higher scores.\n\n#### Objectives\n- **Primary Objective**: Defeat all bosses (specifically, the boss sprite) to win the game.\n- **Secondary Objectives**: Manage and collect villains, keys, and other resources while navigating the map.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins if all boss sprites are defeated (SpriteCounter for the boss is at 0).\n- **Losing Condition**: The player loses if time runs out (timeout limit is reached without defeating all bosses).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Familiarization**: Begin by exploring the map layout to understand the positioning of walls, doors, and enemy thugs.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting the key early on. This will allow access to specific areas (like jaildoors) crucial for progression.\n\n3. **Thug Encounters**:\n   - **Prioritize Thug Elimination**: Engage and defeat thugs quickly to collect villain resources and increase the score. Red thugs offer more points but may be more challenging.\n   - **Avoid Unnecessary Risks**: If encounters with thugs seem unfavorable (especially if low on health or resources), retreat and plan alternative strategies.\n\n4. **Efficient Movement**: Use walls to position yourself strategically against thugs, forcing them to step back and giving you time to think through your next moves.\n\n5. **Resource Exploitation**: Use captured villains effectively, as they contribute to your score. Balance the risk/reward of engaging them against your current resource status.\n\n6. **Boss Strategy**: Prepare for boss encounters with as much resource and score balance as possible to maximize your success. Consider using key resources or prioritized techniques learned from previous thug encounters.\n\n7. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the remaining timeout limit. Aim to defeat all necessary enemies and collect resources efficiently to secure a win before time runs out.\n\nBy utilizing exploration, resource management, and strategic engagements with enemies, players can navigate through this action-adventure maze successfully while meeting both the primary and secondary objectives of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

    "content": "To evaluate the current game state, I notice that my avatar (the cop) is located at (14,9) and there are a few key things to consider:\n\n1. **Objective**: The primary goal is to defeat all bosses. There is a boss located at (1,3) and (1,4). Exploring the map will be necessary to progress towards this goal.\n\n2. **Resources**: The jail (which may contain captured thugs) is nearby at (14,13, %). Collecting resources is essential, especially if I can interact with them effectively.\n\n3. **Time Management**: I have to be mindful of the time limit, so I should act efficiently.\n\n4. **Next Actions**: Since my avatar's position does not change from the previous state last action, moving in a direction is necessary. Moving left does not present immediate advantages since it will lead me towards a wall or farther from meaningful goals without exploring.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best possible action I can take is to move **UP (ACTION_UP)** to coordinate towards interacting with the jaildoor (row 13, column 11), as this may provide an opportunity to capture thugs or access resources. \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nI expect that moving up will allow me to position myself better towards collecting resources or managing vilains effectively while aiming to defeat the bosses later on.",
