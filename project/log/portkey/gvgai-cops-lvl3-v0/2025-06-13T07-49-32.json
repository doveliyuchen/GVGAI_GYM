The player controls an avatar navigating a grid-like space, collecting resources (keys) and managing interactions with various NPCs (thugs and villains) while aiming to defeat a boss character.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game features various immovable and movable sprites, including walls, doors, thugs, and a player avatar.\n2. **Resources:** The player needs to collect keys to open doors, which is essential for progression and interaction with other sprites.\n3. **Character Interactions:** The avatar can collect keys and defeat thugs (red, green, yellow), which spawn villains that can be defeated for score points. \n4. **Jail System:** The jail serves as a location where certain interactions can lead to spawning more transitions or gates once specific conditions regarding resources are met.\n5. **Boss Encounter:** The game terminates successfully when the player defeats the boss sprite.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate through the level, collect keys, defeat various thugs to collect their corresponding resource types, and ultimately defeat the boss sprite.\n- The game also has a scoring system based on actions taken, particularly in defeating villains.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if the player defeats the boss, which removes it from the sprite counter.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if time runs out (1900 units) before achieving victory.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:** Prioritize collecting the key early, as it allows access to the jaildoor and other areas. Balance the need to defeat thugs with collecting resources efficiently.\n   \n2. **Combat Strategy:** Engage with thugs carefully. Since they can spawn different colored villains, consider which thugs to defeat based on the resources they yield, as each villain has a different score associated with its defeat.\n   \n3. **Stay Mobile:** Utilize the walls to your advantage to create barriers against the thugs. When fleeing or engaging, position yourself near walls to prevent being cornered.\n  \n4. **Jail Interaction:** Use the jail strategically; spawn transitions only when you have the corresponding resources (greenvillain, yellowvillain, redvillain). Aim to control your resources in a way that allows for optimal transitions for score enhancement.\n   \n5. **Boss Encounter Preparation:** Before approaching the boss, ensure you have amassed sufficient score and resources to help in the fight. Defeating the boss will likely require careful dodging and timing due to its attributes.\n\n6. **Time Strategy:** Monitor the game timer closely. If time starts to approach its limit, prioritize key objectives and plan your moves effectively to maximize score and resource collection before engaging the boss.\n\nBy implementing this strategy and understanding the dynamics of the game, players can enhance their chances of achieving victory while enjoying the unique challenges presented.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

Moving into the open spaces can also help in maneuvering around potential enemies (thugs or villains) and accessing further resources.\n\nTo maximize my next move, I should attempt to move right (to row 13 column 11) to gather more information and potentially access other areas of the map or resources that may help in battling the boss later.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action allows my avatar to move to an adjacent space, potentially revealing more of the map and resources available.
