The player controls an avatar in a confined space with the objective of dealing with various enemy sprites while managing resources, specifically keys and villain sprites.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites include walls, doors, enemies (thugs and bosses), resources (keys and villains), and the player-controlled avatar.\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can step back when encountering walls and can collect keys.\n   - Enemies (thugs) will step back when colliding with walls or the jail door.\n   - The avatar can spawn resources in specific locations depending on the current state of collected resources.\n3. **Resource Management**: The game revolves around collecting keys and defeating thugs to convert them into villains that can then be removed from play for score points.\n4. **Scoring System**: The avatar gains points for defeating villains, with a higher score awarded for defeating specific colored villains. There is a score cap dependent on the villains defeated (Red = 100 points, Yellow = 5 points, Green = 2 points).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to defeat the boss sprite while managing to collect and properly utilize the keys and other resources. The game has a timeout limit of 1900, meaning the player must act within this time frame to achieve victory by defeating the boss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by defeating the boss (SpriteCounter of `boss` reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the timeout limit of 1900 is reached without defeating the boss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\nTo succeed in this game, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Resource Collection**: Prioritize collecting keys early in the game. This will allow you to interact with jail doors to spawn the villain resources and ultimately reach the boss.\n\n2. **Enemy Management**: Be cautious while navigating around the thugs. Use walls to keep your distance, as thugs \"flee\" and can be tactically avoided to prevent unnecessary damage.\n\n3. **Score Maximization**: Focus on defeating red thugs first, as they yield the most points. However, do not neglect other colored thugs, as they are crucial for resource spawning.\n\n4. **Plan Your Movements**: With a limited timeout, plan your path to optimize time spent collecting resources and defeating enemies. A clear route to your objectives will increase efficiency.\n\n5. **Use Resources Wisely**: As you collect villains from defeating thugs, be strategic about when and where to spawn them. Ensure you have enough keys to interact with jail doors effectively.\n\n6. **Direct Approach to Boss**: After amassing enough score by converting thugs into villains, maneuver towards the boss. Avoid getting cornered, as this could lead to a quick defeat if overwhelmed.\n\n7. **Timed Actions**: Keep a close watch on the timer, ensuring you\u2019re consistently moving toward objectives rather than lingering unnecessarily in less effective areas.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies with a smart approach to resource management and enemy encounters, players can increase their chances of winning against the boss within the set time limit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
