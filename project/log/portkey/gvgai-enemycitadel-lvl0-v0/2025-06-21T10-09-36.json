    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules and level layout provided, this game can be analyzed as a puzzle-adventure game with elements of strategy and exploration. Here\u2019s a breakdown of its components:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game fits into the **puzzle** genre with platforming elements, given the need for spatial reasoning and interaction between various sprites (characters, obstacles, and goals).\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game involves multiple sprites including the player (avatar), enemies, different kinds of holes, crates, boulders, and goals. Each sprite has distinct behaviors and interactions.\n   \n2. **Movement**: The avatar can move around and interacts with various objects:\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls.\n   - Interaction with boulders and crates will cause the avatar to bounce back, influencing the movement strategy.\n   \n3. **Scoring**: The player can score points by successfully interacting with certain sprites, notably:\n   - Killing enemies or utilizing certain holes grants points.\n   - Reaching the goal provides a significant score boost.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, strategically interacting with sprites to:\n1. eliminate enemies.\n2. reach the goal while maximizing the score.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all goal sprites are removed from the level (i.e., after reaching the goal with the avatar). \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar's health points drop to zero (i.e., if they are hit by an enemy).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement and Interactions**: \n   - Use crates to push boulders towards enemies to defeat them. Crates can also be used as barriers against the enemies' movements.\n   - Consolation must be given to avoiding direct confrontation with enemies unless properly prepared or backed up by crates.\n   \n2. **Avoiding Damage**: \n   - Maintain distance from enemies and use objects strategically to avoid health loss. If an enemy pushes you back or causes a health reduction, retreat and re-engage cautiously.\n   \n3. **Maximizing Points**: \n   - Look for opportunities to score as you progress. Aim to utilize square and round holes for scoring, while making sure that boulders do not unconditionally collide with you. This can lead to points gained while minimizing health loss.\n\n4. **Level Exploration**: \n   - Explore the environment to find the most efficient paths to the goal and understand where enemies might cause trouble.\n   - Use the surrounding walls and crates to block enemy movements and create safe pathways to the goal.\n\n5. **Health Management**: \n   - Keep an eye on your health points. If you are consistently losing health, consider retreating and finding alternate paths to avoid unnecessary confrontations.\n\n### Level Layout Observations\n- The layout shows a fixed pathway largely surrounded by walls, which may restrict movement but can also create strategic choke points to manage enemy encounters.\n- The placement of multiple crates indicates opportunities for creating barriers or triggering useful interactions with enemies to score points.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the game's mechanics, players should be able to effectively navigate the challenges posed by the level and work toward achieving victory while optimizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> a\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",
