The use of sprites like crates and boulders, along with the avatar navigating a grid-like structure, suggests a combination of action and puzzle-solving mechanics.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game features different types of sprites, including:\n   - **Immovable Objects** (background, holes, and walls) that create barriers and structure the level.\n   - **Moving Avatar:** The player's character with health points, which must navigate through the level.\n   - **Passive Objects:** Crates and boulders which can be interacted with to affect the game environment.\n   - **Enemies:** NPCs that can harm the avatar and create challenges during gameplay.\n   - **Objectives:** The goal is represented as an immovable sprite that the player must reach.\n\n2. **Interactions:** The interactions dictate how sprites affect one another:\n   - The avatar cannot move through walls or certain holes, forcing strategic movement.\n   - Crates can be used to push boulders into enemies or holes, effectively \"killing\" them and possibly yielding points.\n   - The avatar can get pushed back by obstacles, indicating the need to think carefully about each move.\n\n3. **Score System:** Points can be earned by removing obstacles (killing crates and boulders) and ultimately reaching the goal, which grants a higher score.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is for the avatar to reach the goal sprite while managing health points, avoiding enemies, and utilizing crates and boulders strategically to navigate through the level. Players need to ensure their avatar survives by avoiding direct contact with enemies and planning movements around obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they successfully reach the goal (goal sprite reaches the avatar) while ensuring that the avatar remains alive (health points above zero).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's health points reach zero, indicating that the player has failed to navigate the level successfully.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level, identifying walls, enemies, and potential pathways toward the goal. Notice where the holes and necessary interactions are located. \n\n2. **Enemy Avoidance:** Avoid direct confrontations with enemies as they can reduce your health points significantly. Use crates to block their path or maneuver around them.\n\n3. **Crate and Boulder Utilization:** Use crates to bounce opponent boulders into holes or to block enemies. Position crates to create paths that can lead to the goal, while also considering how they interact with other sprites.\n\n4. **Plan Your Moves:** Carefully plan each movement to avoid obstacles and maximize your actions. Think ahead about how pushing or moving one object will affect others, especially in a crowded space.\n\n5. **Health Management:** Keep an eye on your health points while progressing. If encountering enemies is unavoidable, ensure you have a way to dodge or escape when health is low.\n\n6. **Earning Points:** Aim to clear crates and boulders that can give you points while maintaining focus on getting to the goal. This can also help you strategize which objects to remove first.\n\n7. **Practice and Experimentation:** Experiment with different strategies during multiple runs to understand the levels and patterns of enemy movements better. Each playthrough can provide insight into better mechanics and interactions.\n\nBy applying these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, you will enhance your chances of reaching the goal while maintaining your avatar's health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> @\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

This will allow me to either push it later or create a clearer path.\n\nI will proceed with this action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action fits the strategy as it prepares for future interactions with crates and moves towards clearing a path to the goal.",
