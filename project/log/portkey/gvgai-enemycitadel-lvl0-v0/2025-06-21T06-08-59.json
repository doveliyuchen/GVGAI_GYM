The mechanics involve strategic movement and interactions with objects (sprites) to solve puzzles and reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including the player's avatar, enemies, walls, and obstacles (crates and boulders). The avatar can move and interact with these objects.\n- **Interactions**: Players can interact with various objects in the environment, such as pushing crates, bouncing off boulders, and encountering enemies. The game's mechanics encourage careful maneuvering and strategic placements of objects to progress.\n- **Health Points**: The avatar has a health points (HP) system that decreases when it collides with enemies.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite while avoiding or managing enemies and using crates and boulders to solve puzzles and navigate through the level.\n- Players score points by interacting with certain objects successfully\u2014specifically, by getting a crate or boulder into a square or round hole, and by reaching the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no goal sprites remaining (SpriteCounter for goal reaches 0). This can happen by successfully interacting with the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0), usually by colliding with enemies.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Observation:** Before making any moves, evaluate the level layout and identify the positions of enemies, crates, and the goal. Planning your moves can prevent unnecessary health loss.\n  \n2. **Use Crates Strategically:** Since crates can be bounced off and used to interact with enemies and other objects, use them to your advantage. Aim to direct crates towards enemies or use them to clear paths.\n\n3. **Avoiding Enemies:** Initially, prioritize avoiding enemies as they will reduce your health. Use crates to create barriers or manipulate enemies into positions where they cannot attack you.\n\n4. **Manipulating Boulders:** Use boulders wisely\u2014they can deal damage to both themselves and enemies. Direct them into holes to score points, but be wary of their movement since they can cause setbacks.\n\n5. **Health Management:** Keep an eye on your health points throughout the level; if you find yourself low on health, prioritize evasion over offense. Engage with enemies only when safe and advantageous.\n\n6. **Goal Priority:** Focus on reaching the goal as efficiently as possible. Once the path to the goal is clear, move quickly to ensure that enemies don\u2019t deplete your health before you can reach it.\n\n7. **Practice Puzzle Solving:** The game involves a lot of trial and error for puzzle solving. Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different interactions to find effective solutions to obstacles.\n\nBy carefully managing your movements and interactions and maintaining awareness of your surroundings and health, you will increase your chances of successfully completing each level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is positioned at (4, 4). The nearest goal sprite is located at (4, 1), and there are several crates and some enemies situated throughout the map, notably at positions (1, 10) and two at (7, 9) and (7, 10).\n\nTo strategize effectively, I need to prioritize reaching the goal while avoiding enemies that could deplete my health. Since (4, 4) is two spaces to the right of the goal, the logical first step is to move left.\n\nI will perform the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis indicates that I will move right towards (4, 5). This aligns with the strategy of figuring out my path towards the goal effectively while keeping watch for any enemy movement.",
