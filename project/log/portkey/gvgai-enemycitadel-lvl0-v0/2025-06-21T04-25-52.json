    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game can be classified as a puzzle-platformer, where players need to navigate the environment, overcome obstacles, and solve spatial puzzles involving movement mechanics and interaction with objects.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** These include walls, holes, and the goal, which serve as barriers or objectives. The background is decorative.\n   - **Moving Avatar:** The player controls a character that can move around.\n   - **Passive Objects:** These include crates and boulders with specific interactions. They can be moved or manipulated to solve puzzles or interact with other objects in the game.\n   - **Enemies:** AI-controlled characters that hinder the player's progress.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off certain objects (like crates and boulders) and can be harmed by enemies.\n   - Crates can interact with other crates or walls to clear the way and facilitate movement.\n   - The objective is to use boulders and crates to eliminate enemies and reach the goal.\n   - The game involves strategic placement of crates and boulders to manipulate the environment.\n\n3. **Health Points:** The avatar has a limited number of health points (30), which can be reduced by enemies.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to move the avatar to the goal while avoiding or defeating enemies, solving puzzles created by the layout of walls, boulders, and crates. Upon reaching the goal, the player earns points and progresses in the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (goal sprite is eliminated).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero (i.e., the avatar sprite is eliminated).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Understanding where walls, enemies, and potential hiding spots for crates are is crucial.\n\n2. **Using Crates and Boulders:**\n   - **Crates:** Use crates to bounce off enemies or to lead them into traps like square or round holes.\n   - **Boulders:** They can be utilized strategically to kill enemies when they fall into specific holes or interact with other objects or the goal directly.\n   \n3. **Avoiding Enemies:** While navigating, carefully plan your movements to avoid enemies while positioning crates or boulders between them and the avatar.\n\n4. **Health Management:** Monitor your health points closely. If your health is low, be more cautious and avoid unnecessary engagements.\n\n5. **Maximizing Points:** Focus on collecting points by using crates and boulders to eliminate enemies around square or round holes to improve your score.\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions:** Try different interactions between crates, boulders, and enemies to discover new strategies that may create better paths or eliminate threats.\n\nBy maintaining a balance between aggressiveness (for scoring points) and caution (to retain your health), players can effectively navigate the game's challenges and work towards victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> #\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

The goal ('$') is positioned at (row=4, col=1), and the enemy ('#') is located at (row=1, col=10) and (row=2, col=10) among other crates. \n\nTo reach the goal while avoiding the enemy, I need to evaluate my possible movements. The avatar has ample crates available around that can potentially be used to block enemies or clear obstacles.\n\nI will consider moving left towards the goal.
