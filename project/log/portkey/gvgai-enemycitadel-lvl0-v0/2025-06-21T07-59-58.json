Each interaction with the goal results in a score change, indicating that while the immediate focus may be survival, accumulating points may also play a role.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if there are no goal sprites remaining and they successfully reach the goal sprite.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if their avatar\u2019s health points drop to zero (health limit reached).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Resource Management:** Players should keep an eye on their health points while attempting to navigate the level. Avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies whenever possible.\n  \n2. **Using Crates Wisely:** Crates are very versatile; players should manipulate them to eliminate enemies or reach goal sprites, as they can push against each other and against walls to remove threats.\n\n3. **Navigation:** Plan movements carefully to avoid running into enemies, walls, or falling into holes unexpectedly. Use the layout to your advantage, considering the fixed walls and sprite interactions.\n\n4. **Save Health Points:** Minimize direct interaction with enemies, as they will subtract health points from the avatar. Use crates to push them away or eliminate them without direct combat.\n\n5. **Understand Hole Mechanics:** Differentiate between square and round holes, as they influence how sprites interact and can help achieve strategic advantages in gameplay.\n\n6. **Scoring and Efficiency:** While managing health and eliminating enemies, also focus on scoring. Aim to eliminate goal sprites quickly and efficiently to maximize score and progress towards the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the interactions, players can navigate the levels more effectively, ensuring they reach the goal while minimizing damage to their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> a\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",
