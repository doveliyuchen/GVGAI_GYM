It combines movement mechanics with obstacles and enemies, challenging the player to think critically about interactions.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various types of sprites (objects) are present, including:\n  - **Immovable objects:** Background, holes, walls, and goal.\n  - **Moving avatar:** The player's character with health points.\n  - **Passive objects:** Crates and boulders that can interact with one another and affect the game environment.\n  - **Enemies:** NPCs that pose threats to the avatar.\n  \n- **Interactions:** The game has a series of defined interactions, such as:\n  - The avatar bounces back from walls and obstacles.\n  - Boulders can kill both themselves and enemies when colliding with certain holes.\n  - Crates can also interact with walls, other crates, and the goal, contributing to puzzle-solving.\n  - The avatar loses health when colliding with enemies, while achieving goals or removing crates yields score changes.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to reach the goal while managing the interactions between the avatar, enemies, and environmental objects. Scoring can be achieved by:\n- Successfully guiding boulders or crates into specific holes to eliminate them and gain points.\n- The avatar must interact with the goal sprite to reach the maximum score of 5.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The game is won when all goal sprites are eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Loss:** The game is lost if the avatar's health points are reduced to zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0). \n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Environment Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout. Analyze where crates and boulders are located and how they can be used to remove enemies or reach the goal.\n  \n2. **Effective Movement:** Move the avatar carefully to avoid unnecessary encounters with enemies, leading to health loss. Use the walls to maneuver and set up boulder interactions strategically.\n  \n3. **Utilizing Crates and Boulders:** Use the crates and boulders to your advantage. Try to position boulders next to holes to maximize the chances of defeating enemies (especially when they intersect with holes) or to remove obstacles.\n  \n4. **Manage Health Points:** Monitor your health points. Engage with enemies only when necessary, weighing the risk of losing health against the potential rewards of defeating them.\n\n5. **Experiment with Interactions:** Test different combinations of crate and boulder movements to maximize kills and score changes, especially near the holes.\n\n6. **Plan Ahead:** Always have a few moves ahead in mind to avoid getting trapped or into unavoidable situations with enemies.\n\nBy combining these strategies, players can maximize their effectiveness in navigating through the game's challenges, increasing the likelihood of winning while sustaining their avatar's health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> @\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

    "content": "Analyzing the current game state, the avatar (represented by 'a') is located at (row=7, col=7). The adjacent cells contain enemies, crates, and walls, indicating limited movement options. The immediate goal is to navigate the environment effectively while avoiding damage from enemies and attempting to reach the goals or eliminate enemies via interactions with boulders and crates.\n\nGiven that there is an enemy directly above the avatar at (row=6, col=7) and a strategy to plan movements in advance to avoid unnecessary health loss is vital, it is essential to maneuver correctly to avoid a collision. The best immediate action is to move left to (row=7, col=6), which is an empty space, therefore not risking a health point loss while allowing further possibilities for future moves.\n\nI'll perform the action to the left:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left will help avoid enemies and keep the avatar safe, enabling further strategic moves to position boulders or crates effectively.",
