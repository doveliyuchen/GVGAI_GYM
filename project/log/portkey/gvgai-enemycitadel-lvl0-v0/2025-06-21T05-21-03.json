Points are accrued based on interactions with the specified sprites.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite, and this also contributes significantly to the score.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero. The player must be careful to avoid encounters with enemies and manage health wisely.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Avoid Enemies:** Stay clear of enemies as contact reduces your health points. If unavoidable, interact strategically with crates to bounce away from them.\n\n2. **Manipulate Environment:** Use boulders and crates to your advantage to solve puzzles. Push boulders into holes to eliminate enemies, and use crates to move into strategic positions.\n\n3. **Plan Your Moves:** Since some interactions cause you to bounce back, always plan where you want to push objects and how they will affect your position relative to walls, holes, and enemies.\n\n4. **Maximize Scoring:** Try to position crates into the square or round holes whenever possible to gain points. Each successful interaction contributes to the overall score, bringing you closer to winning.\n\n5. **Manage Health:** Keep an eye on your health points and avoid reckless movements towards enemies. If you are low on health, prioritize safety over point scoring.\n\n6. **Explore the Map:** Use the initial movements to understand where puzzles can be created with crates and boulders. Familiarize yourself with the layout to find the most efficient paths to the goal.\n\nBy employing these strategies, the player can advance through the levels effectively while maximizing points and ensuring the avatar\u2019s survival.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

    "content": "Let's analyze the current state and determine the best action for the avatar located at (5, 4).\n\n### Current Position and Surroundings:\n- **Avatar Position:** (5, 4) -> 'a'\n- **Adjacent Tiles:**\n  - Up (4, 4) -> '.' (empty)\n  - Down (6, 4) -> '@' (crate)\n  - Left (5, 3) -> '@' (crate)\n  - Right (5, 5) -> '.' (empty)\n\n### Objective:\nThe goal is to maximize scoring while avoiding enemies. Currently, the avatar is surrounded by two crates above (5, 3) and below (6, 4) and can move to two empty spaces (up to (4, 4) and right to (5, 5)).\n\n### Actions:\n- Moving **Up (to (4, 4))**: This will not result in any immediate scoring but opens up more options for the next moves.\n- Moving **Down (to (6, 4))**: This may allow for further interactions with the crate below. However, this does not lead to scoring yet.\n- Moving **Left (to (5, 3))**: This allows interaction with another crate. \n- Moving **Right (to (5, 5))**: This leads to another empty space and does not hinder future moves.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. Since we are currently aiming to avoid enemies and manage health, moving down or left would both involve interacting with a crate.\n2. Moving up would keep the avatar safe with additional options for the next turn since enemies are not present nearby.\n\nChoosing to move **Up** seems to be the most strategic option because it keeps options open for future turns and helps in understanding the map better without immediate risk.\n\n```Action: 4```\nThis action is expected to be safe and strategical, positioning the avatar for better options moving forward.",
