The interaction between various sprites indicates that strategic thinking is required to achieve the objectives.\n\n#### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Movement and Interaction:**\n   - The player controls an avatar that can move and interact with various objects (crates, boulders).\n   - The environment has immovable walls and includes various passive and active sprites (enemies, crates, etc.).\n\n2. **Sprite Interactions:**\n   - Crates can push or bounce the avatar back, implying physics-based mechanics.\n   - Boulders can eliminate certain sprites when interacting with specific holes.\n   - The avatar can take damage from enemies and needs to avoid them to preserve health points.\n\n3. **Health Points:**\n   - The avatar starts with 30 health points and can lose health when interacting with enemies.\n\n4. **Score and Goals:**\n   - Points are earned by eliminating certain objects (holes and crates).\n   - A fixed goal sprite must be reached to win the game.\n\n#### Game Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite while navigating through the level and avoiding enemies. Players can score points by eliminating crates and boulders in specific holes. The level ends when either:\n- The player reaches the goal (win condition).\n- The player loses all health points (loss condition).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal sprite while ensuring the avatar's health points remain above zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar\u2019s health points drop to zero due to enemy interactions.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Awareness of Environment:**\n   - Learn the layout of walls, crates, boulders, and enemies. This includes understanding where to safely move and where to expect hazards.\n\n2. **Manage Health:**\n   - Keep a safe distance from enemies to avoid losing health. Utilize crates or boulders as shields or distractions if possible.\n\n3. **Use Crates Strategically:**\n   - Push crates to eliminate enemies or create pathways. Be cautious of the physics involved\u2014the crates can bounce back, potentially putting the player in harm's way.\n\n4. **Interact with Holes:**\n   - Use the round and square holes intelligently to maximize points. Consider the timing and positioning when moving objects into these holes.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Think ahead about your moves and the potential consequences. Where you move may result in enemies stepping back or boulders causing chain reactions.\n\n6. **Reconsider Movement After Each Interaction:**\n   - After pushing a crate or boulder, assess how the environment has changed, and re-evaluate your next move based on the new positions of enemies and obstacles.\n\nBy mastering these strategies, players can navigate through levels effectively, maintaining their health and ultimately achieving victory by reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> a\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

    "content": "In the current state of the game, the avatar (denoted as 'a') is located at position (5, 4). The goal is at (4, 1), while obstacles and enemies are scattered throughout the map.\n\n### Analysis of Current Position\n- The avatar's immediate surroundings are:\n  - **Left (5, 3):** There is a crate ('@').\n  - **Right (5, 5):** This spot is free ('.').\n  - **Up (4, 4):** There is a crate ('@').\n  - **Down (6, 4):** There is a boulder ('b').\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n1. **Avoiding Enemies:** The avatar is in a relatively safe position, as the nearest enemy is positioned at (7, 9).\n2. **Goal Distance:** The goal at (4, 1) is two rows up and three columns to the left of the avatar\u2019s current position. Achieving this will require navigating through crates and avoiding enemies and potential hazards.\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   - The primary strategy involves either moving left toward the crates to potentially eliminate or manipulate them or moving to the right where there are no immediate threats.\n\n### Selected Action\nSince moving left would simply put the player in a position to interact with crates but not advance toward the goal, moving right into an open space seems like a more advantageous choice at this moment. \n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action moves the avatar one position to the right, taking a step toward assessing the rest of the environment while avoiding potential hazards or impasses. I expect this action to maintain a safe distance and help me re-evaluate the next move.",
