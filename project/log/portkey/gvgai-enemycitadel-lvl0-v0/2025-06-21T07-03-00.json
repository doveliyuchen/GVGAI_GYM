    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here is an analysis identifying the game genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle/strategy genre**, specifically akin to classic games like \"Sokoban\" where players solve puzzles by manipulating objects within a constrained environment. The presence of enemies, health points, and various interactive elements also suggests elements from action-adventure games.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features multiple types of sprites, including static (immovable) and dynamic (moving) elements such as walls, holes, the avatar, crates, boulders, and enemies.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the grid and interact with various objects. \n- **Interactions**: Players can bounce off crates and blockades, crush enemies with boulders, and potentially utilize features like square and round holes to score points. The avatar has health points and can lose health through interactions with enemies. \n- **Scoring**: Players earn points by navigating the environment effectively, specifically through successful interactions that eliminate certain sprites (crushing crates or enemies).\n\n### Objectives\nThe main objective is to clear the level by manipulating the game environment to achieve specific goals:\n1. Eliminate enemies and achieve a certain score by triggering interactions that create point-scoring situations (like using boulders on holes).\n2. Reach the 'goal' sprite with the avatar, which contributes additional score points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they eliminate all 'goal' sprites (as dictated by the sprite counter) by the end of the level. Achieving a score that clears the goals while reaching the end goal sprite increases the score.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar\u2019s health points drop to zero due to enemy interactions.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements**: Carefully consider the movement of the avatar and the potential outcomes of each interaction. Prioritize strategic placement of crates and boulders to achieve kill and scoring points effectively.\n\n2. **Eliminate Enemies**: Use boulders to crush enemies efficiently. Positioning your boulders near enemies or using them in combination with holes will help maintain health and score.\n\n3. **Be Cautious of Health Points**: Always keep an eye on the avatar\u2019s health. Avoid direct contact with enemies whenever possible. Utilize crates or environmental features to shield the avatar.\n\n4. **Utilize Holes**: Target squareholes and roundholes strategically to maximize point gain. Make sure to interact with crates and boulders ensuring that when they come into contact with the holes, it results in a scoring opportunity.\n\n5. **Focus on Goal Completion**: While eliminating enemies and gaining points, prioritize reaching the goal to trigger the end of the level and maximize score.\n\n6. **Replay for Optimization**: If available, replay levels to refine strategies based on previous attempts and improve efficiency in score accumulation.\n\nBy using careful planning and exploiting game interactions, players can successfully navigate the puzzles, eliminate threats, and achieve the objective effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

    "content": "To interpret the current state of the game, the avatar is located at row 4, column 4 (represented as `a`). The surrounding area consists of goals (`$` at row 4, col 1), crates (`@`), and an enemy (`#` at row 3, col 4).\n\nGiven the game's mechanics and objectives, the avatar's primary focus should be eliminating the enemy at (3, 4) and reaching the goal at (4, 1). \n\n### Current Analysis\n- The avatar cannot move directly to the left (column 3) as it\u2019s occupied by a crate (`@`).\n- The space directly below (row 5, col 4) is empty (`.`), while to the right (row 4, col 5) is also empty.\n- The space above (row 3, col 4) contains an enemy (`#`), so moving up would result in losing health.\n\n### Strategy\nBased on the analysis, the best approach would be as follows:\n1. Move down (to row 5, col 4), allowing the avatar to avoid the enemy and position itself for potential future moves towards either the goal or the crates.\n2. This also allows for a further move towards the left or right in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven that no previous position change has occurred and to proceed without getting too close to the enemy while still allowing future actions:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is expected to be a safe maneuver while positioning for a better tactical advantage and aligns with the overall strategy of avoiding enemy interactions.",
