The player needs to clear a path to the goal while avoiding damage from enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win Condition: All goal sprites (goal) must be cleared.\n- Loss Condition: The avatar's health reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** \n   - Before interacting with any objects, assess the entire level layout. Identify how obstacles can be navigated and how crates/boulders can be utilized strategically against enemies.\n\n2. **Use Boulders and Crates Wisely:** \n   - Manipulate boulders to push them into holes or use them to knock out enemies by directing them into traps (like squareholes or roundholes) for maximum effect.\n   - Create chain reactions by bouncing crates into enemies, clearing space while avoiding direct confrontation.\n\n3. **Keep Health Intact:** \n   - Prioritize avoidance of enemies rather than confrontation, as losing health could quickly lead to defeat. Use the environment, specifically walls and crates, to block enemy paths.\n\n4. **Explore Efficiently:** \n   - Approach enemies with caution. If moving towards an enemy is necessary, consider moving around walls or using crates to create a barrier.\n\n5. **Incremental Goals:** \n   - Focus on eliminating one enemy at a time or clearing one goal before moving on to the next. Break the level into manageable parts rather than trying to tackle everything at once.\n\n6. **Watch Out for Enemy Movement:** \n   - Enemies exhibit random movement patterns; anticipate their movements so you can safely navigate through the level without risking health.\n\nBy applying this strategy while maintaining awareness of health points and the interaction dynamics, players can improve their chances of successfully completing each level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> a\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %",

Action Left (4, 3): Moves to crate, no immediate benefit because we can't push without moving first.\n2. Action Right (4, 5): Moves to an empty space, allows more movement options.\n3. Action Down (5, 4): Moves down into an empty space.\n4. Action Up (3, 4): Moves up to crate, blocked as we cannot push it without first moving.\n\nGiven that the objective is to move strategically without losing health or getting blocked while maintaining space around the avatar, moving right to empty space seems to be the best option.\n\n### Decision:\nLet's proceed with moving to the right to (4, 5):\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right to an empty space opens up further options for both crate manipulation and avoiding enemies. This aligns well with the strategy of managing health and positioning.",
