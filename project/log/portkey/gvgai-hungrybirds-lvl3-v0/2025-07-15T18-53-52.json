Players control an avatar character and navigate through a grid-based environment.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites (floor, avatar, wall, goal, food, foodbank) represent different objects/environments within the game.\n2. **Health Management**: The avatar starts with a health point system and can gain or lose health based on interactions with food, foodbanks, and time.\n3. **Collecting Resources**: The avatar can collect food to increase health points and score.\n4. **Movement and Blocking**: The walls act as barriers that prevent the avatar from moving through them, requiring navigation around them.\n5. **Goal Completion**: The main goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, which will trigger a win condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate the maze-like environment, gather food to maintain and increase health points, and ultimately reach the goal sprite (door).\n- Secondary objectives include maximizing score by collecting food and utilizing the foodbank.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they successfully reach the goal sprite (door), and the sprite counter for goals reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points drop to zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Gathering**: Prioritize collecting food to replenish and increase health points. Pay attention to the foodbank, as it provides a significant score boost when used.\n2. **Avoid Damage**: Maintain awareness of the time mechanics that reduce health points. Limit movement unless necessary to minimize damage taken.\n3. **Navigation**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls and pathways. Look for the least obstructive routes to maneuver around walls and reach food/resources effectively.\n4. **Health Management**: Keep an eye on your health points and ensure you're collecting adequate food before making any risky maneuvers toward the goal.\n5. **Plan Movement**: Strategically plan movements to avoid unnecessary encounters with walls and minimize the timer-based health reduction.\n\nBy balancing the collection of food and managing health effectively, players can maximize their chances of reaching the goal and securing a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfood foodbank -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfoodbank -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> $\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> #\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> $\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> $\nrow=9, col=14 -> $\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> $\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=10 -> $\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> $\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> a\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> $\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",
