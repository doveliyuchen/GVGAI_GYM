The presence of different gem types and keys suggests strategic mechanics reminiscent of classic puzzle platformers.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - **Avatar:** The player's character, which navigates the level.\n  - **Gems:** Collectible items (red, blue, green) that provide points when collected but can also have negative interactions\u2014specifically, the green gem kills the player.\n  - **Keys:** There seem to be two types\u2014a passive key (key) and a mobile key (keym)\u2014which are essential for interacting with doors.\n  - **Doors and Walls:** These are obstacles that can only be bypassed with the correct items.\n  - **Exit:** A target location that, when reached, results in a win.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - Collecting keys transforms the avatar's key into a mobile version (keym).\n  - The avatar cannot pass through walls and must step back when encountering them.\n  - Doors require the mobile key for access.\n  - Collecting gems can either benefit (in terms of points) or harm (by killing the avatar).\n  - The boulders can bounce off the avatar and its interactions seem to suggest a need for strategic movement.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal of the game is to navigate the maze-like level, collect gems for score points, find the keym to unlock doors, and ultimately reach the exit. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the exit, indicated by the exit count reaching zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed or if the avatar count reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Prioritize Collecting Keys:**\n   - Focus on acquiring the passive key and then transforming it into the mobile key (keym). This is essential to unlock the doors blocking your path.\n\n2. **Avoid Harmful Gems:**\n   - Be cautious about collecting the green gem, as it will result in an instant death. Prioritize collecting blue and red gems for points instead.\n\n3. **Explore Thoroughly:**\n   - Take time to explore all areas of the level. Identify where gems and keys are located in relation to doors, as this will inform your strategy for maximizing scores and reaching the exit.\n\n4. **Plan Movement Around Obstacles:**\n   - Use walls and boulders to maneuver strategically. Consider how each move will affect your position relative to the obstacles, especially since walls can cause you to step back.\n\n5. **Keep Track of Your Score:**\n   - As you collect gems, keep an eye on your score to understand how close you are to potential thresholds for unlocking doors.\n\n6. **Reach the Exit:**\n   - Once you have the keym and have navigated through the level carefully to gather points, make your way to the exit. Ensure that you are not in a position to lose your avatar before completing this task.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the level while balancing the need to collect points and avoid losing their avatar, culminating in a successful exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
