Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> c\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
