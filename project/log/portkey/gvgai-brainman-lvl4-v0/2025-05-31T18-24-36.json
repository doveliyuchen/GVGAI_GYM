Players navigate a character through a series of obstacles and challenges, utilizing specific interactions to achieve their goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - **Avatar:** The main character controlled by the player. Interacts with walls, doors, keys, gems, and boulders.\n   - **Gems:** Different colored gems provide varying point values when \"killed\" (interacted with).\n   - **Keys:** Two types - regular keys (transform into a missile when collected) and the missile version (can be used to open doors).\n   - **Doors:** Require the key missile to be destroyed to progress.\n   - **Boulders and Walls:** Obstacles in the level that can bounce or block the avatar.\n\n2. **Scoring System:**\n   - Points are earned by interacting with colored gems and reaching the exit. Different gems yield different scores: green=1, blue=2, red=5.\n   - The exit provides the highest score (10 points) when reached.\n\n3. **Transformation and Undo Mechanics:**\n   - The game includes transformations (e.g., keys transforming into missiles) and an undo feature for certain interactions. \n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to collect keys, interact with the gems, defeat enemies (or gems), and ultimately reach the exit.\n- Secondary objectives can involve maximizing points through effective gem collection.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully reach the exit indicated by the sprite 'exit', with the counter for exits showing zero upon reaching it.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's count hits zero, typically by being killed by certain interactions (like the green gem).\n  \n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Mapping the Level:**\n   - Before diving in, observe the layout (walls, doors, boulders) and plan your path. Identify where the keys and gems are located and how you can navigate around obstacles.\n\n2. **Collect Gems Wisely:**\n   - Prioritize collecting higher-value gems (red) while being cautious of the green ones, which can lead to your avatar's demise.\n\n3. **Use Keys Effectively:**\n   - Use the regular keys to transform them into missile keys when encountering doors. Managing your keys efficiently will help you create pathways to exit.\n\n4. **Avoid Immediate Death Traps:**\n   - Pay attention to your surroundings when moving towards gems, especially the green ones, and avoid getting too close to them when you have low health.\n\n5. **Progress Slowly and Plan Ahead:**\n   - Move slowly to ensure you understand the interactions you're making and the potential consequences, especially with walls and boulders.\n\n6. **Maximize Score:**\n   - Try to collect as many gems as possible while seeking the exit to maximize your score before reaching a loss condition.\n\nBy strategically moving through the level and managing your key and gem interactions, you can effectively navigate toward the exit while scoring as many points as possible. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> c\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
