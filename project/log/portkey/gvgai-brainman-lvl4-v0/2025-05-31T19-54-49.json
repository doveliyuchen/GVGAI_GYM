    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nBased on the rules and conditions, this game appears to be a puzzle platformer. Players navigate through a grid-like environment, solving challenges and avoiding certain dangers.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various sprites, including the avatar (player character), gems (which can present dangers), keys (both passive and as missiles), doors, walls, and boulders.\n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can move and interact with walls, gems, and doors.\n  - The key transforms into a key missile upon interaction with the avatar, which can be used for further interactions.\n  - Picking up different colored gems has negative consequences, resulting in the avatar's demise.\n  - Collecting the exit before all conditions lead to failure ensures the player\u2019s win.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective appears to be navigating the avatar to the exit while avoiding specific deadly gems and managing keys to unlock doors. Players must earn points by successfully interacting with certain elements and avoid losing all avatar lives.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning:** The player wins if the exit sprite is reached before the avatar count reaches zero.\n- **Losing:** The player loses if there are no avatars (lives) left, indicated by the counter reaching zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Careful Navigation:**\n   - Move cautiously to avoid the deadly gems (green, blue, red). Assess the area before making a move to ensure the path is safe.\n2. **Collect Keys:**\n   - Prioritize finding and collecting keys, as they allow access to doors that can be crucial for progression and may unlock points.\n3. **Utilize Power of Keymissile:**\n   - Transform the key into a key missile and effectively use it to interact with walls or other obstacles. Ensure this is done wisely to maintain your avatar's life.\n4. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities:**\n   - Explore all areas to maximize scoring opportunities by strategically collecting keys and avoiding unnecessary deaths. Avoiding gems improves survivability.\n5. **Plan for Exit:**\n   - Keep track of the exit\u2019s position and distance. Always plan your route to the exit early on to ensure that you can reach it when conditions are favorable.\n\nUsing these strategies will increase your chances of successfully navigating the levels and reaching the exit while managing the dangers and interactions efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> c\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
