    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, let's analyze the game in terms of its genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a grid-based environment, interacting with different objects (sprites) to solve puzzles and complete levels.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The player controls an 'avatar' that can move across the game grid.\n   - Interaction with objects (like walls, doors, keys, and gems) is key to progress.\n   - There are specific interactions that change the state or type of the objects involved (e.g., transforming keys).\n\n2. **Obstacles**:\n   - The game features walls and boulders that block movement.\n   - There are collectible gems and keys that the player can interact with for scoring and accessing other areas.\n\n3. **Collectibles and Points System**:\n   - Collectibles include different colored diamonds (red, blue, green) that provide different scores.\n   - Keys (either passive or missile types) play a role in unlocking doors or interacting with walls.\n\n4. **Winning and Losing**:\n   - The player loses if the avatar is removed from play (counter reaches zero).\n   - The player wins if they successfully navigate to the exit sprite while collecting points along the way.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the exit while managing the resources (gems and keys) and avoiding enemies or dangerous collectibles.\n- Collect as many gems as possible for score bonuses, with red gems being the most valuable.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the exit at least once (exit counter reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar counter reaches zero, indicating that the player's avatar is eliminated or unable to proceed.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand the Environment**:\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, boulders, and doors to plan your movement and avoid getting blocked.\n\n2. **Collect Wisely**:\n   - Prioritize collecting red and blue gems for maximum points. Avoid green gems as they can lead to the loss of the avatar if collected.\n\n3. **Use Keys Strategically**:\n   - Obtain keys before approaching doors. Use the missile type key (`keym`) to unlock doors for scoring.\n   - Be cautious while using keys around walls and gems to avoid undesired interactions.\n\n4. **Plan Movements**:\n   - Since walls can push you back, ensure you have a clear path before approaching doors or boulders.\n   - Use boulders to bounce around the level, potentially clearing your path.\n\n5. **Maximize Points Before Exiting**:\n   - Before heading to the exit, ensure maximum gem collections and point acquisitions to enhance your score.\n\nIn essence, the player's goal is to navigate through this level smartly, balance between point collection and movement strategy, and ultimately reach the exit sprite without losing the avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",

Since the avatar is surrounded by walls on the up and down positions, it makes sense to explore left or right.\n\nChoosing to move **right** (to (3, 3)) keeps options open, as there are multiple pathways in that direction.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect to see the avatar move to (3, 3) and open up more exploration routes while avoiding tight spaces.",
