Players navigate a 2D grid-like environment, interacting with various objects (sprites) to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various items and obstacles exist in the game, such as:\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character.\n  - **Floor**: The walking surface.\n  - **Gems (green, red, blue)**: Collectible items that provide points but are also dangerous to the avatar if interacted with directly.\n  - **Keys**: Allow players to unlock doors but come in two forms: a passive item (key) and a missile version (keym).\n  - **Doors**: Block access until a key is used.\n  - **Walls and Boulders**: Obstacles that the avatar cannot pass through but can interact with (e.g., bouncing off boulders).\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can transform between keys and key missiles, indicating the dual purpose of certain items.\n  - The avatar can interact with walls and doors, where a door can lead to a 'kill' condition if the wrong key type is used.\n  - Collecting gems scores points, but different gems have varying dangers associated with them.\n  - The goal is to reach the exit, which rewards a significant score.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective of the game is to reach the **exit** while managing the interactions with gems, walls, and doors. Players must avoid dangerous interactions with certain items while obtaining keys and navigating to the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the avatar reaches the **exit**, which also grants a significant score of 10 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Path**: Before moving, visualize the path to the exit. Identify the positions of walls and doors along the way.\n  \n2. **Collect Keys**: Prioritize obtaining the key as it is essential for opening doors. Transform it into the missile version for strategic use.\n\n3. **Avoid Dangerous Gems**: Be cautious when approaching colored gems, as they can 'kill' your avatar. Understand that red gems are particularly harmful and give significant negative outcomes if touched.\n\n4. **Utilize Boulders**: Use boulders to bounce away from walls or hazardous gems while navigating the environment.\n\n5. **Check for Exits**: Always be aware of your position relative to the exit. Focus on gathering scores through careful movement and avoiding unnecessary encounters with dangerous sprites.\n\n6. **Resource Management**: Managing when to use or transform the key is crucial. Keep track of your interactions to prevent losing keys unnecessarily.\n\nBy following these strategies and thoroughly assessing the environment, the player can increase their chances of successfully reaching the exit while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> c\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",

    "content": "To analyze the current state based on the provided map layout, let's first identify the avatar's location and the positions of important items:\n\n- **Avatar Position**: The avatar (a) is currently located at (1, 4).\n- **Doors**: There are doors (#) located at (1, 9) and (3, 13). \n- **Key**: There is a key (%) located at (2, 7).\n- **Exit**: The exit ($) is located at (1, 14).\n- **Gems**: Red gems (&) are located at (2, 8) and (2, 10), which are dangerous to the avatar.\n- **Boulders**: There are boulders (@) located at (2, 6) and (2, 11).\n\n### Strategy based on current state:\nFrom the avatar's position (1, 4), the following actionable steps can be considered based on the strategy outlined earlier:\n\n1. **Collect the Key**: Moving towards the key at (2, 7) is vital since it will allow access to the door.\n2. **Avoid Dangerous Gems**: Direct movement toward (2, 8) which is the position of a dangerous red gem should be avoided. \n3. **Assess Movability**: From (1, 4) moving down to (2, 4) or to either side will provide more options.\n\n### Next Action:\nTo obtain the key at (2, 7), the avatar should move down to (2, 4), aiming to collect the key while ensuring we bypass red gems.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis downwards movement should help maximize the strategic advantage by moving closer to the key and allowing future movement options without direct engagement with dangerous gems.",
