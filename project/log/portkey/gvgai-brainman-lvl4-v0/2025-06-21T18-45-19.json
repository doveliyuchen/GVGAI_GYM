Negative points are awarded for dying to gem.\n\n**Win Condition:** All exits are gone (meaning the avatar reached the exit). `SpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0 win=True`\n\n**Loss Condition:** The avatar is gone. `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False` (Likely caused by colliding with a deadly gem sprite.)\n\n**Interactions Explained:**\n\n*   `keym key wall gem boulder > transformTo stype=key`:  If a `keym` (key missile) touches any of these objects, it transforms back into a `key`.\n*   `avatar wall door > stepBack`: Avatar can't walk through walls and doors.\n*   `boulder avatar > bounceForward`: Avatar and boulder bounce off each other.\n*   `key avatar > transformTo stype=keym`: Collecting a key turns it into a key missile (`keym`).\n*   `keym avatar > attractGaze`: Key missile is returned to the player.\n*   `avatar key keym > stepBack`: Avatar cannot pass through keys or key missiles.\n*   `door keym > killBoth scoreChange=4`: Shooting a door with a key missile destroys both, awarding score.\n*   `green avatar > killSprite scoreChange=1`: Collecting green gem kills avatar but yields 1 point.\n*   `blue avatar > killSprite scoreChange=2`: Collecting blue gem kills avatar but yields 2 points.\n*   `red avatar > killSprite scoreChange=5`: Collecting red gem kills avatar but yields 5 points.\n*   `boulder wall key gem boulder > undoAll`: Pushing a boulder against a wall or into other objects is forbidden.\n*   `key wall gem key > undoAll`: Attempting to create infinite key chain is forbidden.\n*   `exit avatar > killSprite scoreChange=10`: Reaching the exit yields 10 points and removes the avatar.\n\n**General Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** Prioritize collecting keys to turn them into key missiles.\n2.  **Door Management:** Use key missiles to open doors strategically, opening paths to the exit.\n3.  **Boulder Pushing:** Manipulate boulders to create pathways or block hazards.\n4.  **Gem Avoidance:**  Steer clear of the deadly gems.\n5.  **Optimize Score:** If gem collection is required to finish a level, strategize to grab the highest score gems at the end of the level before entering the exit, since entering the exit kills the avatar.\n6.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban-like games require careful planning. Think several moves ahead to avoid getting stuck.\n\nIn essence, it's a puzzle game about careful navigation, resource management (keys/missiles), and spatial reasoning (boulder pushing) while avoiding deadly gems. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
