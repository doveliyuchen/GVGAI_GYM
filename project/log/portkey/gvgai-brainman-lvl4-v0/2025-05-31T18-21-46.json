    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle/platformer** genre, as players are navigating through a level with various sprites (objects) and solving puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of different types of sprites, including the avatar (player character), keys, doors, gems, and various wall structures. Some sprites are immovable while others interact with the avatar or each other in specific ways.\n- **Interactions**: The game heavily features interactions between the avatar and other objects, such as keys (which can transform into a 'missile' version), gems (which can harm the avatar), and walls or doors (which can block progress).\n- **Score System**: Players earn scores by dealing with certain objects (collecting gems or interacting with the exit) and can lose points or face defeat when encountering hazards or certain interactions.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to navigate through the level, avoid hazards (like gems that deal damage), utilize keys to unlock doors, and ultimately reach the exit to win the game. The player must carefully manage their interactions to avoid losing the avatar and to maximize their score.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they successfully reach the exit sprite (scoring 10 points).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, meaning they can no longer continue.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before moving, observe the level layout and identify the locations of the door, gems, and the exit. Understand where hazards are located to avoid taking damage.\n2. **Use Keys Wisely**: Collect keys strategically. Transform them into their missile forms when necessary for unlocking doors. Be aware of their interactions with walls and other elements to progress.\n3. **Avoid Gems**: Since gems harm the avatar upon contact, prioritize movement towards doors and avoid stepping on or moving near gems.\n4. **Check Walls and Obstacles**: Walls can block paths; understand their interactions with other sprites so you can effectively navigate around or through them.\n5. **Manage Points**: While reaching the exit is crucial, managing your score through careful collection of gems or avoiding unnecessary damage can be beneficial for overall success.\n\nBy following this strategy and maintaining awareness of interactions with different sprites, players can progress through the levels effectively while minimizing the risk of losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> c\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",

    "content": "To analyze the state, we can identify the current position of the avatar (a) within the game map, which is at coordinates (3, 2). Based on the surrounding sprites, the avatar has some keys available at (2, 1) and (3, 1) but is also near the exit at (1, 14) and a door at (1, 9). \n\nThe objective is to navigate toward the exit while avoiding hazards, such as the gems located throughout the map. The next available step for the avatar is to find a route toward the exit while effectively managing the keys.\n\nSince the avatar's action does not currently change position, I will first determine a meaningful move. I see that moving left or right would continue along the same row, and I want to find an immediate path toward unlocking the door and collecting keys if needed.\n\nSince the door is situated at (1, 9) directly above the avatar's current position, the first move I will make is to **move up** from (3, 2) to (2, 2).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows me to reposition the avatar upward towards the exit path and closer to potential keys. I expect this move to align with the strategy, avoiding hazards while progressing toward the exit.",
