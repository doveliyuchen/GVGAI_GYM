    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's my analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an avatar (`avatar`) in a grid-based world.\n*   **Collectibles:** The player collects keys (`key`) and possibly gems (`green`, `red`, `blue`).\n*   **Obstacles:** Walls (`wall`), doors (`door`), and boulders (`boulder`) block the player's path. Some gems are also harmful.\n*   **Key/Door System:** Keys are required to open doors. The collected key turns into a missile (`keym`).\n*   **Physics/Interactions:** Boulders can be pushed, and some interactions trigger undo actions (`undoAll`).\n*   **Scoring:** The player earns points by collecting certain gems (green, blue, red), opening doors, and reaching the exit.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the exit (`exit`) to win the game. This likely involves collecting keys to open doors that block the path.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All exit sprites are gone (`SpriteCounter stype=exit limit=0 win=True`).  This strongly implies there's only one exit and reaching it triggers the win.\n*   **Loss:** All avatar sprites are gone (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`). This means if the avatar is destroyed, the player loses.\n\n**Key Observations and Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Oriented Avatar:** The avatar might have a facing direction that matters.\n*   **UndoAll:** This mechanic seems crucial and could be triggered by mistakes or used strategically.\n*   **Gems are Dangerous:** Touching green, red, or blue gems will destroy the player, so they are hazardous.\n*   **Key as Missile:** Collecting a key transforms it into a missile, implying the player must \"shoot\" the key at a door. The `attractGaze` interaction suggests that the avatar will be drawn towards it, making movement harder.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Collection:** The first step is always getting the keys.\n2.  **Avoid Harmful Gems:** Pay close attention to the positioning of green, red, and blue gems, as they will kill the avatar.\n3.  **Strategic Boulder Pushing:** Use boulders to your advantage. Consider where they need to be moved to open paths or block hazards.\n4.  **Door Opening:** Plan the key trajectory to open the doors. The `attractGaze` rule suggests that the key missile (`keym`) pulls the avatar, which might need to be used cleverly.\n5.  **Master UndoAll:**  Experiment to understand which situations trigger `undoAll` and how it can be exploited to solve puzzles.\n6.  **Reach the Exit:** Once all doors are open and dangerous gems are avoided, navigate to the exit to win.\n\n**In summary:** This game is a puzzle where you have to collect keys, use them to open doors, and avoid hazards to reach the exit. Strategic thinking and careful planning are essential for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
