The player navigates through a maze or a level, interacting with various objects to solve puzzles and reach an exit.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** There are various types of sprites including:\n  - **Immovable Objects:** Floors, walls, exits, doors.\n  - **Player Avatar:** The main character controlled by the player.\n  - **Collectibles:** Gems and keys, which affect score and unlocking abilities.\n  - **Boulders:** Objects that can interact with the avatar and other sprites.\n\n- **Interactions:** The game supports several interactions:\n  - **Movement and Collision:** The avatar can interact with walls and doors, which can block movement.\n  - **Item Transformation:** The avatar can collect keys and turn them into a missile-like form for further interactions.\n  - **Puzzle Elements:** Unscrambling sprite positions using keys, boulders, and walls.\n  - **Scoring System:** Collecting gems results in different score points depending on their type.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the level, collect keys and gems, and ultimately reach the exit. Players must solve puzzles and strategically use their collected items to enhance their score and overcome obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player **wins** (win=True) if they reach the exit and reduce the exit sprite counter (exit limit=0).\n- The player **loses** (win=False) if the avatar sprite counter reaches 0, which implies running out of life.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Collect Wisely:** Focus on collecting gems and keys as they not only increase your score but also provide essential ways to navigate through the level. Different gems have different score values, so prioritize them based on your objectives at that time.\n\n2. **Use Keys Effectively:** Keys can unlock doors and affect how you interact with other objects. Make sure to convert them correctly and plan their usage throughout your journey, especially ensuring that you can reach the exit.\n\n3. **Be Careful with Obstacles:** Avoid running into green gems (which can kill your avatar), and avoid situations where walls or doors can trap you. Watch for boulders, as they can bounce you back and change your position unexpectedly.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path:** Since movements can lead to game over conditions, plan ahead by visualizing your actions using the items you\u2019ve collected. Look for opportunities to use boulders, walls, and gems to create pathways and solve any encountered puzzles.\n\n5. **Track Your Score:** Keep an eye on your score to determine if your collection route is beneficial. Try to collect red, blue, and green gems to maximize the score and ensure you have enough points to continue playing.\n\n6. **Level Exploration:** Explore the level fully before heading to the exit, as you want to ensure all paths and collectibles are accounted for. Knowledge of your immediate surroundings can turn challenging situations into successes.\n\nOverall, patience and strategic thinking are key components of successfully navigating this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
