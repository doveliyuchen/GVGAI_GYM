Players control an avatar and must navigate through a level, solving puzzles and avoiding or overcoming obstacles in order to reach an exit.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Objects**: The game consists of various sprites, including walls (`wall`), floors (`floor`), obstacles like doors (`door`), boulders (`boulder`), gems (`gem`), and keys (`key` and `keym`). \n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls the `avatar`, which can move around the level but interacts with the environment based on specific rules.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can:\n  - Collect `keys` and transform them into a special type `keym` which has different properties.\n  - Be harmed or lose points by interacting with `green`, `blue`, or `red` gems.\n  - Face obstacles like walls and doors that may hinder their progress.\n  - Use boulders to bounce back or potentially manipulate other objects in the environment.\n- **Score System**: Players accumulate points based on their interactions with gems and the exit. Specific actions can also lead to the death of the avatar, which costs the player a loss condition.\n\n### Objective\nThe player\u2019s goal is to navigate through the maze-like level, collect keys, avoid gems that harm the avatar, and ultimately reach the exit. Each successful interaction can either yield points or damage. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won by reaching the `exit` sprite, which gives a score bonus of 10 points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the `avatar` is eliminated (counter reaches 0).\n  \n### Level Layout\nThe level comprises a grid-like structure where walls and obstacles are strategically placed. There are clear paths denoted by dots but also barriers represented by walls. \n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Careful Navigation**: Move cautiously to avoid damaging gems (green, blue, red) which will incur penalties.\n2. **Collecting Keys**: Prioritize obtaining `key` sprites to transform them into `keym`, which can be pivotal in unlocking areas or utilizing specific interactions.\n3. **Understanding Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how different sprites interact, particularly how you can modify or manipulate obstacles (using boulders or keys for strategic advantages).\n4. **Plan Routes**: Before proceeding, visualize potential routes you can take to avoid traps and reach the `exit` efficiently.\n5. **Maximize Score**: Make smart choices about collecting gems while being wary of their penalties; focus on reaching the exit to secure total victory points.\n\nBy carefully managing movement, understanding the mechanics of the game, and strategically planning interactions, players can maximize their chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",

The only nearby floor tiles are to the left (3, 2) and above (2, 3). There is a door directly to the right (3, 4) which will require keys to proceed further. The avatar also has a `keym` located at (3, 1) but cannot directly access it without moving.\n\nGiven that the last action I need to take should change the avatar's position since it hasn't moved yet and the immediate left (3, 2) is free, I will choose to move left to (3, 2).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to (3, 2) is important as it avoids harmful gems and opens up further navigation options without being obstructed by walls.",
