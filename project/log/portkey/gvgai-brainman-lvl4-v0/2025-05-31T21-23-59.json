    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer. The player navigates through various levels, interacting with objects, avoiding dangers, solving challenges related to collecting items and accessing exits.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - The game features different types of sprites (objects) such as an 'avatar' (the player character), 'gems' (which likely serve as collectibles), 'keys' (which interact with doors), and 'boulders' (innate mechanics to manipulate).\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - Certain interactions allow for transformations and actions, such as picking up keys, manipulating walls, and causing certain sprites to vanish or change state.\n  - Killing sprites (like collecting gems or encountering exit) may grant score changes.\n  - The avatar can bounce off boulders and is affected by walls and doors, suggesting movement and positioning are crucial to gameplay.\n\n- **Termination Conditions:**\n  - The game ends when the avatar is eliminated or when the exit is reached. Reaching the exit while staying alive results in a win.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary objective of the player is to navigate through the level, collect keys, gems, and reach the exit while avoiding or overcoming obstacles and enemies. There is also an element of scoring based on the items collected and actions performed.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning:** The player wins by reaching the exit, which leads to a score increment depending on remaining life or actions.\n- **Losing:** The player loses if the avatar runs out of lives (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level and the position of all immovable objects like walls and doors. Identify possible paths to navigate safely.\n\n2. **Collect Keys Wisely:**\n   - Prioritize collecting keys that can open doors. Use keys strategically to avoid confrontations with enemies or hazards that can eliminate your avatar.\n\n3. **Gem Collection:**\n   - Collecting gems is beneficial not just for points, but potentially for power-ups or abilities that may aid in navigating the level.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dangers:**\n   - Be cautious of colored gems (green, blue, red), as they lead to the avatar's elimination. Plan routes to avoid them whenever possible.\n\n5. **Utilizing Boulders:**\n   - Use boulders to interact with walls or enemies effectively. They may help clear paths or serve as shields from enemies.\n\n6. **Exit Strategy:**\n   - Once you've opened doors and collected sufficient keys and gems, make your way to the exit promptly to secure your win. Maintain awareness of any remaining threats.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game involves strategy focused on navigation, utilizing various game mechanics, and weighing the risks of collecting items against potential threats. Success relies on careful planning and strategic use of the environment and items.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
