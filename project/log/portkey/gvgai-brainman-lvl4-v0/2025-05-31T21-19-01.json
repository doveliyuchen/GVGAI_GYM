It combines elements of exploration and problem-solving, requiring strategic movement and item interactions.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites exist in the game, including the avatar, collectibles (gems), keys, doors, walls, and boulders.\n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can interact with keys, doors, walls, and collectible gems. Movement mechanics involve stepping back upon contact with certain objects.\n- **Transformation and Interaction**: The avatar can transform items (like keys) into different forms (like key missiles). Interactions are critical to gameplay, often leading to beneficial or detrimental outcomes.\n- **Killing/Scoring Mechanics**: Contact with specific sprites (green, blue, red gems) leads to score changes. Additionally, the exit sprite provides a significant score and represents a level goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to reach the exit sprite while collecting gems for points. The player must also navigate obstacles, utilize keys to open doors, and ensure the avatar remains alive.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no exit sprites left, indicated by the `exit` sprite counter reaching 0.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar's counter reaches 0, meaning the avatar has been killed.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\nTo effectively navigate this game, the player should consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Resource Management**: Keep track of collectible gems and use them wisely to maximize score while ensuring not to get killed by the avatar.\n  \n2. **Item Interaction**: Learn how to effectively use keys (transforming them into missiles) to access blocked paths (doors or walls).\n\n3. **Avoiding Harm**: Be cautious when approaching sprites that can \"kill\" the avatar (like the green gem). Prioritize avoiding red and blue gems, as they provide higher penalty scores.\n\n4. **Plan Movement**: Before making a move, analyze the surrounding area to anticipate boulder movement, wall interactions, and gem positions to minimize setbacks.\n\n5. **Sequential Progression**: Approach levels sequentially; ensure all obstacles (like doors and walls) are dealt with before moving on to collecting gems or reaching the exit.\n\nBy combining careful planning, responsive interactions, and strategic resource management, players can achieve high scores and successfully complete levels in this puzzle-platforming game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\nboulder door -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> c\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
