    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre:\nThis game appears to fit into the **puzzle platformer** genre, characterized by its combination of puzzle-solving and exploration elements within a platforming environment.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: Various types of sprites are present, including the player's avatar, gems of different colors (green, red, blue), keys, walls, boulders, and doors. \n- **Interactivity**: The player can interact with keys and doors, collect gems, and move around obstacles (walls, boulders). The avatar can also be transformed into a key when interacting with certain sprites.\n- **Movement and Transformation**: The avatar can move and potentially change states based on interactions, like becoming a missile (keym).\n- **Scoring**: Collecting gems and reaching the exit contributes to the score, with different colored gems providing varying points.\n\n#### Objective:\n- The primary objective of the game is to navigate the level, collect gems, and reach the exit while avoiding dangers (presumably the green, blue, and red gems act as hazards).\n  \n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the sprite counter for the exit reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has successfully reached the exit.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has been eliminated.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Collect Knowledge**: Familiarize yourself with how each sprite interacts with the avatar. Understanding which gems kill the avatar and what actions trigger score changes is critical.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Safe Navigation**: Avoid green, blue, and red gems to keep your avatar alive. Instead of recklessly collecting, navigate carefully through the level while planning your moves.\n\n3. **Use Keys Wisely**: Keys appear to be integral for opening doors and possibly transforming or defeating certain obstacles (such as walls). Collect keys as they may unlock more areas for exploration.\n\n4. **Plan Interactions**: Since certain interactions can lead to 'undoing' actions, think strategically about when and how to interact with objects like boulders and walls.\n\n5. **Take Advantage of Points**: Focus on reaching the exit for a significant score addition. Accumulating points through gem collection before reaching the exit is a priority, but not at the cost of losing the avatar.\n\n6. **Explore All Paths**: Given the complexity of sprite interactions, keep exploring various paths even if they initially seem futile. You may find keys or gems that will aid your progress.\n\n7. **Avoid Overcommitment**: If you become too reliant on collecting gems, you may expose yourself to danger. Balance your collection with viable navigation towards the exit. \n\nBy employing these strategies, players can efficiently progress through the game while maximizing their score and ensuring the avatar's survival.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nred -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> *\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> *\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> w\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> #\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> *\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> *\nrow=4, col=9 -> *\nrow=4, col=10 -> *\nrow=4, col=11 -> *\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> *\nrow=4, col=14 -> *\nrow=4, col=15 -> *",
