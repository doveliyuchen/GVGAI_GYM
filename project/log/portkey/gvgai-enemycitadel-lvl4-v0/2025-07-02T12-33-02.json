Crates can also bounce against each other or move in response to other objects. \n- **Health & Enemies:** The avatar has health points and can lose health by colliding with enemies. \n- **Scoring System:** Players can score points by interacting with certain objects (e.g., sending a boulder or crate into a hole).\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to guide the avatar to reach the goal sprite while accumulating points by interacting with crates and boulders, defeating enemies, and avoiding health loss. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal (sprite 'goal') and the goal sprite count reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's health points drop to zero. \n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Familiarize with Layout:** Start by understanding the level layout, identifying the locations of walls, crates, enemies, and the goal. Take note of where holes are located since they can be crucial for scoring.\n\n2. **Prioritize Avoiding Damage:** Since the avatar has limited health, avoid direct confrontations with enemies whenever possible. Use crates and boulders to block or redirect enemies if they're coming too close.\n\n3. **Utilize Boulders and Crates:** Boulders can be used to eliminate both the avatar\u2019s enemies and score points by guiding them into holes. Use crates to bounce back from enemies or obstacles, creating strategic movement paths.\n\n4. **Optimize Interactions:** Use the interactions wisely; the combination of crates and boulders can help clear pathways to the goal or dispatch enemies. For instance, moving a boulder into a hole could potentially eliminate both and give the player a score boost.\n\n5. **Plan Moves Ahead:** Since the avatar can be bounced back by interactions, plan your moves ahead. Each action can lead to multiple outcomes, so thinking several steps ahead can help avoid being trapped or losing health.\n\n6. **Score Maximization:** Focus on scoring through interactions with boulders and crates while balancing the risk of engaging with enemies. Aim to route any boulders or crates efficiently to maximize points before reaching the goal.\n\n7. **Stay Flexible and Adapt:** Be ready to change your approach based on the game's evolving situation. If the enemies are positioned in a challenging way, it may be better to create diversions rather than directly confronting them.\n\nBy applying these strategies thoughtfully, players can efficiently navigate the puzzle-like environment, avoid damage, and achieve victory by reaching the goal while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nsquarehole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> %\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> a\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> @\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> @\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> @\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> &\nrow=10, col=3 -> &\nrow=10, col=4 -> &\nrow=10, col=5 -> &\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> &\nrow=10, col=8 -> &\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=10 -> &",
