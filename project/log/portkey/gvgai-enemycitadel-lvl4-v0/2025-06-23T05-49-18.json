Players control an avatar that navigates a level filled with obstacles, enemies, and objectives, requiring problem-solving skills to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Movement & Actions**:\n   - The player controls an avatar that can move around the level and interacts with various sprites.\n   - The avatar can push crates and boulders to manipulate the environment.\n\n2. **Interaction Types**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Background, holes (square and round), goal, and walls can't be moved.\n   - **Passive Objects**: Crates and boulders can be moved or pushed around.\n   - **Enemies**: When the avatar comes in contact with an enemy, it loses health.\n   - **Goals**: The player must reach the goal to score points and win.\n\n3. **Health System**:\n   - The avatar has a finite number of health points (30). Collisions with enemies decrease health, and if it reaches zero, the game ends.\n\n#### Objectives:\n- The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite to win. Each time the avatar interacts with the goal, it results in a score increase and a 'kill' of the avatar sprite.\n- Additional scoring can be obtained by killing certain other sprites (like crates upon specific interactions) while also avoiding damage from enemies.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: Achieve zero 'goal' sprites remaining in the level (indicated by the goal's SpriteCounter reaching zero).\n- **Loss**: The avatar loses all health points, causing the game to terminate.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Keep track of your health points as taking damage from enemies can lead to a quick loss. Avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies.\n\n2. **Optimize Movements**:\n   - Use crates and boulders strategically to block enemies or to reach areas that may be otherwise inaccessible. Pushing boulders into enemies can eliminate them and also result in score bonuses.\n  \n3. **Plan Interactions**:\n   - Before moving crates or boulders, assess their position relative to enemies and holes. Missteps can result in damage or traps that might hinder progress.\n   - Utilize square and round holes to strategically eliminate crates and score points, but be mindful of the enemy's position to avoid being hit.\n\n4. **Explore Before Acting**:\n   - Take your time to explore the level layout. Understanding where different objects are located can help you plan your moves more effectively.\n\n5. **Sequential Moves**:\n   - When multiple crates are near each other, consider pushing them together to create a chain reaction that can clear obstacles without direct confrontation with enemies.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics and goals of the game, you can enhance your performance and make more effective choices as you progress through the levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\ncrate -> '@'\nenemy -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nsquarehole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> @\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> &\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> %\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> &\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> &\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> @\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> @\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> @\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> &\nrow=10, col=3 -> &\nrow=10, col=4 -> &\nrow=10, col=5 -> &\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> &\nrow=10, col=8 -> &\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=10 -> &",
