The inclusion of sprites that interact in varied ways suggests a focus on solving obstacles to reach a goal, while the movement and shooting mechanics contribute to the platforming aspect.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move around the level and shoots bombs.\n- **Destructible/Transformable Objects:** Various materials (like boxes, water, and fire) interact with the avatar and bombs, leading to transformations or eliminations. \n- **Goals:** The primary goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, represented as a green door.\n- **Health and Damage:** The avatar has a health system with points deducted upon contact with fire.\n- **Timed Elements:** The game has a timeout condition indicating time management may also play a role.\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to navigate through the level with the avatar, manipulate the environment using bombs, avoid hazards (such as water and fire), and successfully reach the goal (green door) before time runs out or losing all health.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** Reaching the goal while keeping a count of available health and time.\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar's health points drop to zero.\n  - Running out of time.\n  - Falling into water.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Careful Navigation:** Systematically move through the level, avoiding hazards such as water and fire.\n  \n2. **Bomb Usage:** Use bombs strategically to:\n   - Clear pathways by destroying certain blocks.\n   - Transform hazards into more manageable forms (e.g., turning fire into spark).\n  \n3. **Resource Management:** Be mindful of your health and time:\n   - Avoid contact with fire to preserve health.\n   - Stay aware of the timer to ensure you navigate efficiently.\n  \n4. **Exploit Interactions:** Understand the interactions between various elements:\n   - Fire interacts destructively with objects like boxes and water, allowing you to create new paths.\n   - Bombs can be used to trigger chain reactions that open paths and clear obstacles.\n\n5. **Plan Moves:** Before executing a move, consider the avatar's next potential position and how it can create a more favorable outcome, thereby maximizing progress toward the goal.\n\nUsing these strategies should help improve chances of success in this puzzle-platforming adventure.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcup lup -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlup water -> '&'\nbomb -> '*'\nbombm -> 'l'\nspark -> 's'\nspark wall -> 'w'\nbomb wall -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> %\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=15 -> %\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> %\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> %\nrow=4, col=17 -> %\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> %\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> %\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> c\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> %\nrow=8, col=17 -> %\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> a\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

I need to navigate through the level, avoiding hazards while potentially making use of the nearby boxes for creating paths or clearing obstacles.\n3. **Potential Actions:** The most immediate action involves moving in the available directions while considering the presence of the boxes that could be used strategically. Moving left, right, up, or down might also reveal a new strategy due to any interaction with destructible objects.\n\nTo proceed towards the goal, I will perform the action of **moving up** since that direction seems to lead towards clear paths and not obstructed by any immediate hazards.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis move is intended to advance towards the goal and observe the results of this action, ensuring I stay mindful of any hazards or changes to my position in the next state.",
