The player must use bombs strategically to manipulate the environment.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** If the player reaches the goal door while there are still avatar sprites remaining.\n- **Loss:** If the player runs out of avatar sprites or if the time limit expires.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Environmental Awareness:** Keep track of the arrangement of water, fire, and boxes in the level. Avoid water to ensure the avatar stays alive and use bombs wisely.\n  \n2. **Bomb Placement:** Use the bombs to transform or destroy hazardous sprites, especially the fire. Bombs can eliminate danger such as fire, while letting you explore the level further.\n\n3. **Score Preservation:** Since interacting with boxes and fire increases score, look for ways to set up interactions between them without placing yourself in danger.\n\n4. **Moving Carefully:** Take moves cautiously, ensuring that the avatar's health is maintained. Avoid jumping directly into water or flames unless you have planned for it and are ready to manage the consequences.\n\n5. **Plan Routes:** Before interacting with multiple objects, chart a path that avoids hazards and allows strategic bomb placement in key spots. Taking calculated steps will increase the chance of reaching the goal successfully.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can increase their chances of completing the level while minimizing the risks associated with hazardous interactions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcup lup -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlup water -> '&'\nbomb wall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> %\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=15 -> %\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> %\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> %\nrow=4, col=17 -> %\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> %\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> %\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> %\nrow=8, col=17 -> %\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> a\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
