Be particularly cautious around water and fire.\n   \n2. **Utilizing Bombs**: Use bombs to manipulate the environment. Bombs can destroy boxes or create sparks, which may open pathways or eliminate hazards.\n\n3. **Fire Management**: Control and manage fire wisely. Fire can eliminate blocks or transform into mud; however, it can also damage you. Make sure to keep a safe distance while managing fire behavior.\n\n4. **Avoiding Obstacles**: Always be aware of your surroundings; do not step into water and avoid getting too close to fire unless necessary. Tracking fire spread and its interaction with other sprites is crucial.\n\n5. **Engagement with Lasers**: Handle lasers with care, as they can transform bombs into smaller projectiles that attract attention or damage.\n\n6. **Timed Movement**: Keep an eye on the timer and make moves efficiently to avoid losing due to timeout.\n\n7. **Health Preservation**: Keep track of the avatar's health when dealing with harmful sprites. Retreat or avoid confrontation when health is low.\n\n---\n\n### Tips\n\n- Pay attention to sprite interactions, leveraging environmental elements to your advantage.\n- Plan moves ahead, considering how one interaction may lead to the next.\n- Experiment to discover new interactions and strategies for progressing through levels.\n- If playing is not possible through direct routes, finding alternative paths to the goal can preserve health and ensure survival.\n\nBy effectively combining these mechanics and strategies, players can navigate through challenges and successfully reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcup lup -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlup water -> '&'\nbomb -> '*'\nspark wall -> 'l'\nbomb wall -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> %\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=15 -> %\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> %\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> %\nrow=4, col=17 -> %\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> %\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> %\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> %\nrow=8, col=17 -> %\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

The objective is to reach the green door at (row 1, col 9). \n\nGiven the context of the game and the avatar's position, the next step is to explore the environment to find a safe path to the goal. Here, the immediate surrounding row has the following layout:\n\n- To the left (row 9, col 8) is a box ('@').\n- To the right (row 9, col 10) is a dot ('.').\n- Up (row 8, col 9) is also a wall ('%'), which will block upward movement.\n- Down (row 10, col 9) is another wall ('%').\n\nMoving to the right (to row 9, col 10) seems optimal as it contains a dot ('.'), which is a non-lethal ground type and allows for further actions afterward.\n\nThus, I will move to the right. \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis move is intended to keep exploring and create a route toward the green door, aligning with the strategy of exploration. I will expect to see if I can further evaluate the environment from there.",
