Players control an avatar that must traverse a map filled with various sprites (elements) while solving puzzles and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game contains multiple types of sprites (objects), including walls, water, mud, boxes, fire, lasers, bombs, and the goal (door).\n- **Movement and Interactions**: The player's avatar can interact with these sprites in specific ways that affect gameplay:\n  - Colliding with walls and boxes causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Water is lethal to the avatar.\n  - The goal sprite (green door) signifies a victory condition.\n  - The avatar can transform certain sprites (like bombs) into other forms based on interactions.\n- **Health and Transformations**: The avatar has health points (10) and can be damaged by fire. Certain transformations change the nature of sprites (e.g., water turning into mud, or fire impacting boxes).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe objective of the game is to reach the goal sprite (the green door) while managing the avatar's health and avoiding lethal interactions. Successfully navigating through and manipulating the environment to clear a path to the goal is key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the goal (door) sprite.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar loses all health points (health reaches 0).\n  - The avatar runs out of time (timeout limit of 1000 units).\n  - The avatar collides with water.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Path Planning**:\n   - Analyze the initial layout and identify potential routes to the goal. Note the positions of obstacles and danger zones.\n   \n2. **Manipulating Sprites**:\n   - Use bombs judiciously to clear paths or to interact with fire and other elements. Be cautious not to let bombs or fire attack the avatar or cause health loss.\n   - Exploit the transformation capabilities of certain sprites; for example, turning water to mud can create safe pathways.\n\n3. **Health Management**:\n   - Actively avoid fire and other sprites that diminish health. Remember that the avatar loses health from direct interaction with fire.\n   - Keep an eye on health points; do not take unnecessary risks that could lead to health loss.\n\n4. **Testing Interactions**:\n   - Approach interactions carefully to understand how different sprites affect one another. This knowledge can be advantageous in crafting strategies to clear the path to the goal.\n\n5. **Adapting to the Environment**:\n   - Be prepared to adjust the strategy based on sprite transformations and the dynamic nature of the game. Use the environment wisely to trap or avoid threats.\n\nIn conclusion, a mix of spatial awareness, careful interaction, and resource management will enhance the chances of successfully navigating the game and reaching the goal while preserving the avatar's health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcup lup -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlup water -> '&'\nbomb wall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> %\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> %\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> %\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=13 -> %\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=15 -> %\nrow=2, col=16 -> %\nrow=2, col=17 -> %\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> %\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> %\nrow=4, col=17 -> %\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> %\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> @\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> @\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> @\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> @\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> @\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> %\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> %\nrow=8, col=14 -> %\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> %\nrow=8, col=17 -> %\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> a\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> *\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
