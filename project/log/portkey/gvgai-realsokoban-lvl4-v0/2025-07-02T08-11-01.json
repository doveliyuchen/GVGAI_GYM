There are also \u201cbounce\u201d effects between certain sprites.\n\u2003\u2013 Box Handling: The main interactive objects are boxes. When you push a box over a hole, it transforms (becomes \u201cboxin\u201d) and you gain points. However, if that transformed box touches a \u201cground\u201d sprite afterward, it turns back into the original box and you lose points.\n\u2003\u2013 Undo/Reset: There is a rule saying that if a \u201cbbox\u201d (a type of passive collision sprite) interacts between a wall and another bbox, an \u201cundoAll\u201d happens. That suggests the game might let you reverse moves if you make a wrong push, or it might automatically backtrack problematic moves.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Objective: The aim is to eliminate all the boxes from play. This typically is achieved by transforming them \u2013 you want to push each box so that it lands in a hole and stays there.\n\u2003\u2013 Win Condition: The level is won once there are no untransformed boxes left on the board (SpriteCounter for box reaches zero).\n\u2003\u2013 Loss/Challenges: If you push a box in the wrong way (for example, if it contacts the ground after being transformed on a hole, thereby reverting to a box), you may negate your previous progress. Also, collisions with walls or other objects might force you into retracing your steps.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan Your Moves: Think ahead about how pushing any box will interact with holes and ground. You want to push a box onto a hole so it transforms permanently (earning points and removing it from the count), but be careful not to accidentally let the transformed box touch the ground.\n\u2003\u2013 Control the Space: Navigate the maze-like layout with walls and hidden floors. Avoid \u201cdead ends\u201d that might trap the box or force it into a reversion.\n\u2003\u2013 Use Undo Wisely: If the game lets you undo moves (as suggested by the undoAll rule), use this feature to experiment with different sequences of pushes without irreversibly harming your score.\n\u2003\u2013 Prioritize Safe Conversions: Work to convert boxes one at a time, ensuring they are positioned such that they won\u2019t later slide back onto the ground. Once a box is safely transformed by being correctly placed over a hole, focus on the next.\n\nIn short, you must carefully maneuver the knight to push boxes into holes where they transform, while avoiding moves that might revert them back. The game rewards careful planning and strategy in clearing all boxes to win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
