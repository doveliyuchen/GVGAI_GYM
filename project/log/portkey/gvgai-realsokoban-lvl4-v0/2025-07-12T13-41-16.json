You have to figure out how to move objects around a maze\u2010like level in order to meet the goal.\n\u2003\n\u2022 The Main Objectives:\n\u2003\u2013 Your goal is to remove all of the \u201cbox\u201d sprites from the level. When there aren\u2019t any boxes left, you win.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Key Mechanics:\n\u20031. You control an avatar (displayed as a knight) that can move around but cannot go through walls. If you run into a wall, the game makes you step back.\n\u20032. There are boxes (represented by \u201cbox\u201d). You can push these boxes around.\n\u20033. There are special tiles called holes (they show up in dark blue). When you push a box into a hole, that box transforms (turns into \u201cboxin\u201d) and you gain a point.\n\u20034. However, if a box that has been transformed (boxin) finds itself on a \u201cground\u201d tile (a floor tile), it will change back into a normal box and you lose a point. This means you must be careful about where your boxes go after transforming.\n\u20035. There\u2019s also a \u201cbbox\u201d object that seems to interact with both the avatar and walls. When the avatar collides with a bbox, it gets bounced forward, and if a bbox hits a wall and another bbox, the game undoes all of the moves that just happened. This is likely a safeguard to make sure the physics don\u2019t go out of control and to add another twist to your puzzle solving.\n\u2003\n\u2022 The Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 You win when every box has been cleared from the level (SpriteCounter for box reaches 0). There isn\u2019t an explicit \u201closs\u201d condition mentioned, but your progress can be undone by bad moves (for example, triggering an undo if a bbox collides with a wall and another bbox, or losing points by accidentally pushing a boxin off its safe spot back to the ground).\n\u2003\n\u2022 Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Think Ahead \u2013 Since boxes can transform when pushed into holes (gaining you a point) but will revert (losing a point) if they end up on ground, plan your moves carefully to keep each transformed box safely in the hole.\n\u20032. Use the Environment \u2013 Walls are immovable and will force your avatar to step back if you bump into them; leverage them as anchors or barriers to control the movement of boxes. Avoid accidental collisions that could force a box off a hole.\n\u20033. Manage Chain Reactions \u2013 Watch for the special interactions (for example, those involving bbox) that may \u201cundo\u201d moves if things collide incorrectly. Make slow, deliberate moves and verify that your boxes are in safe positions before committing to a change.\n\u20034. Keep Score \u2013 Even though points aren\u2019t your main objective, the score changes (gaining a point when a box enters a hole and losing one if that boxin goes to the ground) indicate that maintaining transformed boxes in the holes is key.\n\u20035. Puzzle Out the Layout \u2013 The level is laid out like a maze with walls and open spaces. Survey the whole level to decide which box should be moved first and where you should move the avatar so that you can push boxes into holes with minimal risk of them sliding off.\n\u2003\nIn summary, you\u2019re playing a puzzle where precise moves are crucial. Navigate your knight carefully, push boxes into holes to transform them safely (and score points), and avoid careless moves that might reverse your progress. Think multiple steps ahead and use walls and the maze layout to your advantage. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
