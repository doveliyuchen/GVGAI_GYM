Analyze the level layout and identify the holes where boxes can safely transform into \u201cboxin.\u201d They are your targets.\n\u20032. Plan your movements to push each box directly onto a hole so that it converts into \u201cboxin\u201d and remains there. A good move sequence is crucial since once a box is on a hole, you must avoid further moves that could make it touch the ground.\n\u20033. Be cautious when maneuvering around walls\u2014the avatar will step back if it bumps into them, so use that to your advantage for repositioning, but avoid accidental misplacements.\n\u20034. Keep in mind the reversal mechanism (boxin to box when contacting the ground) and try to lock boxes in the hole area.\n\u20035. Use any undo or bounce mechanics (triggered by the \u201cbbox\u201d interactions) if you end up in a tricky situation, and adjust your strategy to prevent unwanted reversals.\n\nBy carefully planning your pushes and positioning the boxes so that they are transformed permanently into \u201cboxin\u201d (thus effectively removing them from the \u201cbox\u201d count), you\u2019ll fulfill the win condition and complete the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> a\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
