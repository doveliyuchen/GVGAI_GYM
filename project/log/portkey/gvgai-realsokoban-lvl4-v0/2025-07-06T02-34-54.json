    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, a Sokoban variant)\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The player (avatar) pushes boxes around the level.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:**  Players need to plan their moves carefully to avoid getting boxes stuck or blocking their own path.\n*   **Transformations:** Boxes change state (from 'box' to 'boxin' and back) based on where they are.\n\n**Objective:**  Get all the 'box' sprites into 'hole' sprites.\n\n**Win Condition:** `SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`  Means the player wins when there are zero 'box' sprites remaining in the level. In other words, when all 'box' sprites are transformed into 'boxin' sprites.\n\n**Loss Condition:**  (Not explicitly stated, but implied)  If the player gets into a state where they can no longer move any boxes into holes, the game is effectively lost (though the system doesn't automatically register a loss).  This would happen if a box is pushed into a corner or against a wall in a way that it can't be moved again.\n\n**Sprite Explanations:**\n\n*   `floor` and `ground`: These are likely the standard walkable tiles. They might be visually distinct, with `ground` potentially being used in the \"in\" state. The hidden property of each suggests that the visible tiles is a different tile.\n*   `hole`: The target location for the boxes.\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character.\n*   `bbox`: Seems like a bumper or blocker. This could be a 'bumper' that is triggered when the avatar is next to it.\n*   `box`:  The standard box that needs to be pushed into a hole.\n*   `boxin`: The transformed state of a box after it's been pushed into a hole. It also can go back into a 'box'.\n*   `wall`: Impassable obstacles. `autotiling=True` means the wall sprites will automatically connect visually to form continuous walls.\n\n**Interaction Explanations:**\n\n*   `avatar wall > stepBack`: Prevents the player from moving through walls.\n*   `bbox avatar > bounceForward`: The avatar will be pushed back when it collides with a `bbox`.\n*   `bbox wall bbox > undoAll`: This is a really interesting mechanic. When a `bbox` is pushed between two walls, everything is undone! This allows the player to backtrack if they mess up.\n*   `box hole > transformTo stype=boxin scoreChange=1`:  When a box is pushed into a hole, it transforms into a 'boxin' and the score increases by 1 (though score doesn't seem to be used for win/loss).\n*   `boxin ground > transformTo stype=box scoreChange=-1`:  When a boxin is pushed back onto a 'ground' tile, it becomes a normal 'box' again.\n\n**Level Analysis:**\n\nThe provided level is small but seems to have a few key elements:\n\n*   Walls create constrained pathways.\n*   Limited space makes pushing boxes tricky.\n*   The initial positions of the boxes and the avatar are important.\n*   The position of the `bbox` sprites is crucial.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Before making any moves, visualize the sequence of pushes required to get the boxes into the holes.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Be very careful not to push a box into a corner where it can't be moved.\n3.  **Utilize the Undo:** Recognize that the `bbox` between the walls allows the player to revert to a previous game state.\n4.  **Think About Box Transformation:** Understand that a 'boxin' becomes a 'box' when pushed back out of the hole and onto a 'ground' sprite.\n5.  **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to try different approaches, especially early on. The undo mechanic makes experimentation less risky.\n\nIn summary, this is a classic Sokoban-style puzzle game with an interesting twist involving box transformations and an undo mechanism. Success depends on careful planning, spatial reasoning, and the ability to anticipate the consequences of each move.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
