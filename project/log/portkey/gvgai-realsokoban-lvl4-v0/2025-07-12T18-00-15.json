The interaction \"bbox wall bbox > undoAll\" strongly suggests that the bbox mechanic is buggy or intended to make puzzles difficult.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary objective is to get all `box` sprites into `hole` sprites.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** The player wins when the number of `box` sprites reaches 0 (all boxes are transformed into `boxin` in holes).\n*   **Loss:** There is no explicit loss condition defined in the rules. However, the player can get stuck if they push a box into a corner or against a wall in a way that prevents them from pushing it any further.\n\n**Sprites Explained:**\n\n*   `floor`, `ground`: Background tiles, likely indistinguishable, possibly used in different level design contexts.\n*   `hole`: The target location for the boxes.\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character.\n*   `bbox`: A passive sprite that affects movement when the avatar or box collides with walls.\n*   `box`: The standard movable box that the player needs to push into the holes.\n*   `boxin`: The box that has been successfully placed inside a hole.\n*   `wall`: Impassable barriers that define the level boundaries and create obstacles.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   The level layout shows a small, confined space with walls, holes (represented by `o`), boxes (represented by `*`), and the avatar's starting position (`A`).\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban games require careful planning.  Random pushing will likely lead to the boxes getting stuck.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Be cautious about pushing boxes into corners or against walls where you might not be able to move them again.\n3.  **Optimize Movements:** Minimize the number of pushes required to solve the puzzle.\n4.  **Utilize Space:** Use the available open space to maneuver the boxes into the correct positions.\n5.  **Account for Box Transformations:** Be mindful of where a box can be transformed back if it is moved from a hole.\n6.  **Beware of the Bbox Bug:** If the \"bbox\" sprite is causing unexpected behavior, carefully analyze your movements around walls to avoid triggering the bug.\n\nIn short, this is a Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player must push boxes into holes. Planning and careful execution are key to success. The \"bbox\" mechanic is likely buggy and needs to be worked around.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> a\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
