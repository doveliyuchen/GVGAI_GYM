The avatar can move around while interacting with other sprites.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar cannot move through walls and will step back if it tries to do so.\n  - The \"bbox\" (presumably a box or some movable object) will bounce back when colliding with the avatar.\n  - The interaction between two \"bbox\" items in contact with a wall will result in an \"undo\" effect, likely resetting their positions.\n  - Boxes can be converted into \"boxin\" by placing them in a hole, which gives a score increase.\n  - Boxes that are placed on the ground revert to their original state when \"boxin\" is moved back, resulting in a score decrease.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to manipulate the environment to ensure the sprite count for 'box' reaches zero before the game ends \u2014 this condition results in a win.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: All 'box' sprites must be transformed into 'boxin' sprites, effectively reducing their count to zero (SpriteCounter stype=box -> limit=0).\n- **Losing Condition**: While the rules don't specify a clear loss condition, failing to reduce the 'box' count to zero within the game's level configuration appears to indicate a loss.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understanding the Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, holes, and the spaces available for movement. Noting the positions of boxes and holes will inform your actions.\n  \n2. **Utilize Interactions Wisely**: Use the bouncing interaction of the bbox effectively to position boxes nearest to holes. Make sure to manipulate your movements so you don\u2019t get stuck against walls or in positions that prevent further movement.\n\n3. **Prioritize Box Placement**: Aim to move boxes to holes first before dealing with 'boxin' reverting back. Work systematically to convert as many boxes into 'boxin' as possible.\n\n4. **Plan Movements**: Ensure each move brings you closer to converting a box. Plan your moves to avoid undo states created by \"bbox wall bbox\" interactions, which could reset your progress.\n\n5. **Manage Scores**: Be mindful of the score changes; transitioning boxes to holes increases scores, while placing 'boxin' back on the ground decreases it. Balance this so your score does not fall to zero.\n\n6. **Exploit the Level Structure**: Use the structure of walls and ground to create paths to holes and organize boxes efficiently. This could save moves and ensure better box-to-hole interactions.\n\nBy implementing a well-thought-out strategy that focuses on systematic box management and maximizing the score while converting boxes, players can effectively clear the level and achieve victory in this puzzle platformer.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> a\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
