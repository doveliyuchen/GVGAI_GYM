You must maneuver objects (in this case, boxes) around a grid-based level with obstacles (walls, holes, etc.) to reach a specific board state.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 You play as an avatar (a knight) that moves around the level.\n\u2003\u2013 The playing field is built out of immovable pieces like walls, floors (or ground), and special areas called holes.\n\u2003\u2013 There are boxes that can be pushed or bounced when interacting with your avatar or other elements.\n\u2003\u2013 When a box is moved into a hole, it changes state (\u201ctransforms\u201d) into a variant (called \u201cboxin\u201d) and you gain a point.\n\u2003\u2013 However, if that \u201cboxin\u201d touches the ground, it transforms back into a box but your score decreases.\n\u2003\u2013 Other interactions, like bumping against walls or other passive objects (the \u201cbbox\u201d), cause a bounce or even an \u201cundo\u201d effect, which resets recent moves.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win Condition:\n\u2003\u2013 The goal is to eliminate all of the \u201cbox\u201d sprites from the level.\n\u2003\u2013 In practice, this means you need to convert every box into its alternate \u201cboxin\u201d form and keep it from reverting back\u2014since the win condition is defined as having zero boxes (the game doesn\u2019t count \u201cboxin\u201d in that tally).\n\n\u2022 Strategy Suggestions:\n\u20031. Plan Your Moves: Think ahead about how pushing a box toward a hole will immediately change it into a boxin, which is \u201csafe\u201d from counting toward the loss. Avoid accidentally letting a boxin hit the ground where it reverts to a box.\n\u20032. Use the Environment: Walls and other immovable objects can act as buffers or guides so that once a box is in the hole (changing into a boxin), it won\u2019t quickly run into the ground.\n\u20033. Control Box Movement: Since the avatar bounces boxes forward and walls force a step-back, you\u2019ll need to carefully manage how boxes roll or slide. A miscalculated push might undo your progress.\n\u20034. Manage Undo Effects: Some interactions (like a box hitting a wall in the wrong way) trigger an \u201cundo\u201d\u2014this resets recent moves, so it\u2019s important to minimize reckless or imprecise actions.\n\u20035. Balance Score and Progress: Although score changes aren\u2019t the win condition, they offer feedback on your moves. Earning points by converting boxes to boxin is good, but be mindful of moves that might drop your score by accidentally reverting them.\n\nIn summary, the game challenges you to methodically push boxes into holes so they become \u201csafe\u201d boxin sprites, managing the risk of them reverting back. Think of it as a spatial puzzle where each move must be calculated so that once a box is out of the win-count, it stays that way. Good planning, careful movement, and using the level layout to your advantage are the key tactics for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> @\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",
