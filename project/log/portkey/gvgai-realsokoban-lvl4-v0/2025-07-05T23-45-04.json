These elements don't move and serve as boundaries or goals.\n  - **Moving Avatar (Player):** The player is represented by the 'avatar' sprite, which is capable of movement and interaction with other objects.\n  - **Boxes:** The player must maneuver 'boxes' and 'boxin' types, each with distinct interactions, to achieve the game\u2019s objectives.\n\n- **Interactions:** The interaction mechanics dictate how the player can interact with walls, boxes, and holes:\n  - The avatar will 'step back' when hitting a wall.\n  - The avatar will 'bounce forward' upon colliding with a bounding box ('bbox').\n  - When a box is placed in a hole, it transforms into a 'boxin', scoring the player points. Conversely, the 'boxin' can revert to a standard box when placed on the ground, deducting points.\n\n- **Termination Conditions:** \n  - The objective centers around reducing the number of standard boxes (boxes) to zero. If successful, the player achieves a win state.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal is to interact with the boxes strategically to move them into the holes, converting them to 'boxin' and ultimately eliminating all boxes from the level, leading to victory.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Winning Condition:** The game is won when there are no 'box' sprites remaining.\n- **Losing Condition:** The game appears to lack explicit loss conditions based on the provided rules, but poor strategic choices may lead to an unsolvable level if moves are exhausted.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Moves Ahead:** Prioritize planning a sequence of moves that will efficiently transform boxes into holes while avoiding creating unsolvable configurations.\n\n2. **Use Layout Wisely:** Pay attention to the level layout to avoid being blocked by walls, which could trap the avatar or create a situation where certain boxes cannot be moved.\n\n3. **Maximize Points:** Aim to turn boxes into \u2018boxin\u2019 sprites as a priority since they contribute positively to your score. Be cautious about placing them on the ground, which would negate previously earned points.\n\n4. **Experiment with Interactions:** Understanding how each interaction affects both the avatar and boxes can provide deeper strategic options. For example, use the bounding box to create space for maneuvering.\n\n5. **Reset If Needed:** If a particular strategy leads to a stalemate, consider undoing your last moves or re-evaluating your current position to find a better route.\n\nBy applying these strategies, players can effectively navigate puzzles and work towards lowering the box count to achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> a\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> $\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $",

    "content": "The current state of the game shows that the avatar (represented by 'a') is located at (8, 4), next to a box (represented by '@') at (8, 5). The goal is to move the box into a hole to score points and eventually eliminate all boxes.\n\nGiven the available actions and the current position of the avatar, the immediate action to take is to move the avatar to the right (to (8, 5)) to push the box to the right. This will transform the box into a 'boxin' if it is moved into a hole. Since the hole at (8, 5) is currently occupied by the box, it will remain a box unless another move can push it into a proper hole.\n\nExecuting the action to the right is as follows:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving to the right should ideally result in pushing the box into the hole if a subsequent action places it correctly. I expect this move will initiate the process of transforming the box into a 'boxin', aligning with the strategy to reduce box count.",
