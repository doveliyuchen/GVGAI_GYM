Identify locations of traps, walls, and potential pathways to the exit.\n  \n2. **Coat Collection:** Try to collect the red or blue coat as soon as possible. Transform into the respective avatar state to access otherwise blocked areas (like red walls for the red avatar or blue walls for the blue avatar).\n\n3. **Avoid Traps:** Pay close attention to your surroundings and move carefully to avoid traps, as hitting one will incur a score penalty and may limit your avatar's viability in the level.\n\n4. **Timing:** Keep track of your time. Although you have a timeout limit, a rush to the exit could lead to errors. It's better to take calculated risks to ensure you do not lose avatars or score points.\n\n5. **Explore:** Explore all pathways. Some routes may seem less direct initially but could provide valuable coats or avoid traps.\n\n6. **Utilize Walls Effectively:** Use walls strategically. If you're in danger of hitting a trap, backtrack to a wall to re-evaluate before proceeding.\n\n7. **Watch Your Avatar Count:** Be aware of changes to your avatar count based on transformations and dying due to traps. Ensure you have enough avatars to reach the exit. \n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the game while balancing the risks of traps and utilizing the unique mechanics of the avatars and coats.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbluecoat -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nnormalWall -> '$'\nredWall -> '%'\nredcoat -> '&'\ntrap -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> $\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> #\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> *\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> $\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=12 -> $\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> $\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> $\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> $\nrow=9, col=12 -> $\nrow=9, col=13 -> $\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> %\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=8 -> $\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> $\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> $\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> $\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> .\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",
