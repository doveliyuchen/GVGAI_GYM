    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **action-adventure** genre with puzzle elements, as players must navigate a space with various interactive sprites while engaging in combat, solving puzzles, and avoiding obstacles.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game contains different sprites including the player avatar, enemies, goals (small and large), keys, walls, and items (like the sword).\n2. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player controls an avatar that can attack (with a sword) and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Enemies**: There are different types of enemies with varying speeds (quick, normal, slow) that the player must either defeat or avoid.\n   - **Goals**: The player must reach goals (both small and large) to score points. There are conditions for reaching these goals based on whether the player has a key.\n   - **Keys and Transformations**: If the avatar interacts with a \"nokey,\" they can pick up a \"key,\" which transforms them into a \"withkey\" state that allows them to interact with goals differently.\n\n### Objective\nThe player's main objective is to acquire points by reaching the goals, defeating enemies, and navigating the level while avoiding being defeated by enemies. The ultimate goal is to reach all collectible goals (small and large) and succeed in the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The game concludes successfully (win) when the player successfully interacts with the sprite counters for the small or large goals.\n- **Losing**: The game ends in loss if the avatar sprite is defeated (i.e., less than zero hit points or score points).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Take the time to explore the layout of the level to determine the best routes and locations of key sprites.\n2. **Combat and Defense**:\n   - Prioritize defeating enemies to prevent them from hindering progress. Use the sword effectively to engage enemies while avoiding damage.\n   - Avoid close confrontations with multiple enemies. Instead, pick them off one at a time if possible.\n3. **Key Collection**: Focus on acquiring the key (transforming from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\") as soon as possible. This will allow access to more points through the small and large goals.\n4. **Goal Strategy**:\n   - Assess which goals can be reached more quickly and prioritize them based on the current state (with or without the key).\n   - Target large goals that provide more score points, especially when you have the key to maximize scoring opportunities.\n5. **Resource Management**: Keep track of health points and avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to avatar defeat.\n\nBy using these strategies, players can increase their chances of navigating the level effectively, optimizing points, and ultimately achieving victory in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To choose the best action, let's first analyze the current state of the avatar and context on the map. \n\nThe avatar is currently in the \"withkey\" state, located at (row 10, col 10), where the layout shows:\n- `s` (sword) at (10, 10) which represents the avatar's current position.\n- `&` (small goal) at (10, 11) reachable from the avatar's current position.\n\nNext, we need to consider the strategy. Since we are in the \"withkey\" state, we should prioritize reaching goals to gain points. The nearest available option is the small goal to the right (10, 11).\n\nTherefore, the logical action here is to move the avatar to the right to interact with the small goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right to interact with the small goal is a strategic choice to score points effectively.",
