It features exploration, item collection, and interaction with various objects and enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Player Controls:** The player controls an avatar that can interact with the environment using a sword and collect keys.\n- **Collectibles:** Key objects (keys, vases) and goal items (smallgoal, largegoal) serve as objectives.\n- **Enemies:** Different monsters with varying speeds and difficulty challenge the player, and collisions with them can have negative effects.\n- **Transformations:** Collecting a key transforms the avatar's state from 'nokey' to 'withkey,' which allows access to certain areas.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal is to collect small and large goal items while navigating a level filled with enemies and obstacles. The smallgoal increases the score by 1, while the largegoal increases it by 10. The player must also manage to avoid losing points through interactions with enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:** The player wins if they successfully collect either smallgoal or largegoal items.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the player\u2019s avatar is killed (score change to -1, represented by the SpriteCounter tracking the avatar).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Navigation and Exploration:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout to identify the locations of the keys, goals, and enemies. \n   - Use walls as barriers to navigate around enemies and prevent direct confrontations, especially with the enemy types that can easily harm you.\n\n2. **Enemy Engagement:**\n   - Prioritize avoiding enemies when possible since collisions with them negatively affect your score.\n   - Engage enemies only when necessary (certain enemies can yield points when defeated) and use the sword effectively to minimize damage taken.\n\n3. **Collecting Keys and Goals:**\n   - Focus on finding keys as quickly as possible. Keys enable you to open the doors (smallgoal and largegoal), unlocking a significant portion of points.\n   - When you have collected a key, make sure to utilize it on the appropriate goal as soon as you're able to maximize your scoring potential.\n\n4. **Optimize Score Accumulation:**\n   - Balance between engaging enemies for potential score increases and running away to preserve your avatar\u2019s life and overall score.\n   - Aim for the largegoal first when you have the key collected, as it provides a higher score reward.\n\n5. **Manage Resources:**\n   - Keep track of how many enemies you've defeated and your current score to gauge your progress and risk-taking as the game progresses.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics and layout, players can effectively navigate the game and score high without losing their avatar. The key to success lies in a balanced approach to exploration, enemy engagement, and efficient goal completion.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword -> '*'\nnokey sword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To effectively analyze the current state of the game, we can observe the following:\n\n1. **Current Position of Avatar:** The avatar is located at (10, 10) where it is in a state of 'withkey' (indicated by 's'). The presence of a smallgoal ('&') is directly to the right at (10, 11).\n\n2. **Goals and Collectibles:** \n   - The smallgoal at (10, 11) will increase the score by 1.\n   - There is also a largegoal at (8, 11) which is farther away but offers a more substantial point increase if the avatar can reach it.\n\n3. **Enemies:** No enemies are currently in close proximity, which allows for safe movement towards the goals.\n\nGiven that the avatar can directly move to the smallgoal and increase its score without encountering any immediate threats, the optimal action is to move right.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right will allow the avatar to collect the smallgoal and increase the score by 1, which aligns with our exploration and score accumulation strategy.",
