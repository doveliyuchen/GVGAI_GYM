It includes elements of exploration, combat, and item collection, typical of classic adventure games and platformers.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an \u201cavatar\u201d that can move around the game area. The avatar has a sword that allows it to interact with various elements (like enemies and destructible objects).\n   \n2. **Goals**: \n   - There are two types of goals: \u201csmallgoal\u201d and \u201clargegoal\u201d, each represented by doors that can either be opened or interacted with depending on the state of the avatar and whether it possesses a \u201ckey\u201d.\n   \n3. **Collecting Items**: Keys are essential for progression. Collecting keys transforms the avatar into a \u201cwithkey\u201d state, enabling access to certain goals.\n   \n4. **Enemies**: The game features different types of enemies, each with varying speed and difficulty represented by \"monsterQuick\", \"monsterNormal\", and \"monsterSlow\". The avatar can defeat enemies using its sword.\n   \n5. **Destructible Objects**: The game includes objects that yield points when interacted with, such as \u201cvase\u201d and enemy \u201ckillSprite\u201d.\n\n6. **Walls and Obstacles**: There are walls that act as barriers and should be navigated strategically.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect keys and defeat enemies while progressing through the level to access and unlock the small and large goals. The ultimate goal is to reach the goals, scoring points, and winning the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the count of \u201csmallgoal\u201d and/or \u201clargegoal\u201d sprites is increased, signaling that these goals have been reached successfully.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated (score changes negatively), making it crucial to manage health by avoiding enemy encounters.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout and identify key locations of enemies, keys, and goals. \n   \n2. **Combat Efficiently**: Use the sword to defeat enemies but be mindful of your health. Engaging multiple enemies at once could lead to losing points or health, so strategize encounters.\n\n3. **Focus on Key Collection**: Prioritize obtaining the key to transform from \u201cnokey\u201d to \u201cwithkey\u201d as it will allow you to progress further into the level and unlock doors.\n\n4. **Manage Resources**: Keep track of how many enemies you've defeated and how many points you've accumulated. Make sure to collect items like vases for additional points.\n\n5. **Avoiding Overcommitment**: Don\u2019t venture too close to enemies unless you're ready to engage. Use obstacles (walls) to your advantage to avoid unnecessary damage.\n\n6. **Multiple Paths**: Look for alternative routes in the layout that may help avoid stronger enemies or lead to additional keys or points. \n\nBy properly managing your resources, efficiently navigating the game world, and making smart combat choices, you can maximize your chances of reaching the game\u2019s goals while minimizing the risk of a loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword wall -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nkey sword -> 'n'\nwithkey -> 's'\nsmallgoal sword -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

The avatar also has access to a large goal (represented by '#') at (8, 11) and has defeated an enemy at (5, 3). \n\nGiven the current position, the strategy dictates that we should prioritize reaching the small goal, which can be accessed by moving right from (10, 10) to (10, 11). This would increase the count of the small goal sprites and contributes towards winning the game.\n\nSince the avatar is currently in the \"withkey\" state (indicated by 's'), we have the necessary item to approach and interact with the goals. \n\nTherefore, the most logical action to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action translates to moving right towards the small goal.
