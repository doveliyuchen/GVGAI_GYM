It includes scenarios where the player navigates through a maze-like level, collects items, and interacts with various sprites.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - **Player Sprite ('avatar'):** It can shoot (indicated by \u2018shootAvatar\u2019) and interacts with other sprites including enemies and items.\n  - **Goals ('smallgoal', 'largegoal')**: There are different types of doors that represent goals to achieve; smaller goals grant lower points compared to the larger goals.\n  - **Key Mechanic ('key'):** Obtaining a key changes the player's sprite, allowing access to certain goals.\n  - **Enemies:** Different enemy types with varying cooldowns and behaviors, indicating a need for strategy in combat or avoidance.\n  - **Obstacles:** Movable walls and other features must be navigated or utilized to progress.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach and interact with certain goals while battling enemies and avoiding losing points from interactions. Collecting keys and defeating enemies contributes to achieving higher scores. The game concludes as soon as specific win conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - The player wins when they have interacted with the required amounts of the small and large goals, indicated by clear victory conditions (e.g., 'SpriteCounter stype=smallgoal win=True').\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The player loses if their avatar sprite is killed (indicated by \u2018SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False\u2019).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Understand Enemy Patterns:** Observe the movements and cooldowns of enemies. Different enemy types (quick, normal, slow) dictate varying engagement strategies.\n  \n2. **Collect Keys Early:** Focus on acquiring keys as soon as possible to unlock the small goal and potentially large goals for higher scoring.\n\n3. **Prioritize Goals:** The large goal provides more points than the small goal, so prioritize reaching it, especially since it doesn't require the key.\n\n4. **Manage Health:** Avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies that could lead to losing points. Consider engaging only when you can ensure a safe defeat of an enemy.\n\n5. **Utilize Environment:** Take advantage of the level design, such as using movable walls strategically to block enemy paths or create safe zones for regrouping or planning.\n\n6. **Score Management:** Keep track of your score based on interactions to understand if you are on track to meet necessary conditions for winning.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game, optimize score potential, and work toward achieving victory conditions while minimizing the risk of failure.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nsword wall -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nkey sword -> 'n'\nsword withkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, here's the information I can analyze:\n\n1. **Avatar's Position:** The avatar (denoted by 'a') has not been explicitly shown in the map provided. However, there is a sword with a key ('s') at position (10, 10) and a small goal ('&') at position (10, 11).\n2. **Walls:** The map has many walls ('w') that will restrict the avatar's movement.\n3. **Goals:** The nearest goal is the small goal located at (10, 11), while the large goal is at (8, 11), which needs a key to access.\n4. **Enemies:** There are multiple enemies present (many being monsterNormal '$' at (4, 11) and (7, 10)) but we are currently not aware of the avatar's proximity to any, if at all.\n\n### Goals and Strategy:\n- Collect the key and interact with the small goal.\n- Moving strategically to either avoid enemies and if the avatar has not moved recently, try to engage to collect the key for future goals.\n- Since small goals will help in accumulating points, the priority is on the small goal.\n\n### Action Choice:\nSince there's not enough information indicating where the avatar is positioned specifically, the focus is on the small goal. The next logical action is to move right towards the small goal in position (10, 11).\n\n```Action: 3```\nThis action should lead me to collect points from the small goal, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing goals and avoiding unnecessary combat.",
