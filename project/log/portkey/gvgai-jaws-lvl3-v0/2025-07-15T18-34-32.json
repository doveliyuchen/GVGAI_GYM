It focuses on navigating an underwater environment and involves collecting resources while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent various entities:\n   - **Immovable**: Water, an obstacle.\n   - **Spawn Points**: Holes that spawn sharks, whales, and piranhas.\n   - **Player Avatar**: Represented as a yellow submarine that can shoot torpedoes.\n   - **Enemies**: Sharks, whales, and piranhas, each with a defined behavior and interaction rules.\n   - **Resources**: Gold shells and shark fangs that provide score and have limits.\n\n2. **Shooting**: The avatar can shoot torpedoes to kill fish and other enemies which transform into resources (shells) upon destruction.\n\n3. **Enemy Interaction**:\n   - Sharks chase the avatar and can kill it if certain conditions regarding resource limits are met.\n   - Whales and piranhas can also transform torpedoes into resources when hit.\n   - Specific interactions depend on the quantities of collected resources.\n\n4. **Resource Collection**: Players need to gather resources strategically to survive and score points. The \"shark fang\" resource gives a significant score.\n\n5. **Limits and Cooldowns**: Certain enemies have cooldowns to limit their frequency in spawn, adding an element of timing to player movements.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to survive the threats posed by sharks, whales, and piranhas while collecting valuable resources (shells and shark fangs) to achieve a high score. The player must avoid losing all their avatars (indicated by reaching a sprite limit of 0).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Survive for a set amount of time (1000 game ticks).\n- **Loss Condition**: All avatars are lost, leading to a game over scenario.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting shells and shark fangs. Maintain a balance between offensive (shooting enemies) and defensive (avoiding being killed by sharks) strategies.\n\n2. **Timing and Positioning**: Be aware of enemy spawn points and their attack patterns. Use the environment to your advantage to navigate around sharks and plan your shots carefully to maximize resource collection.\n\n3. **Prioritize Threats**: Deal with enemies in order of threat. If sharks are nearby, prioritize dodging over collecting resources until it is safe. Utilize torpedoes strategically to transform enemies into useful resources.\n\n4. **Movement Patterns**: Stay mobile to avoid becoming a target for sharks. Keep an eye on your resource levels to avoid being overrun by sharks when they have the advantage.\n\n5. **Utilize Power-Ups**: If applicable, prioritize collecting resources that can increase your score or give you temporary advantages against enemies.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can navigate the challenges of the game effectively while working towards maximizing their score and ensuring survival against the various threats in the underwater environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater piranhahole -> '1'\nwater whalehole -> '2'\nwater sharkhole -> '3'\nwater -> '.'\npiranhahole water -> '@'\nsharkhole water -> '#'\nwater whale whalehole -> '$'\nwater whale -> '%'\nshark water -> '&'\npiranha piranhahole water -> '*'\npiranha water -> 'p'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=0, col=16 -> .\nrow=0, col=17 -> .\nrow=0, col=18 -> .\nrow=0, col=19 -> .\nrow=0, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> 2\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> .\nrow=2, col=20 -> @\nrow=3, col=0 -> 2\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> p\nrow=3, col=19 -> p\nrow=3, col=20 -> @\nrow=4, col=0 -> 2\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> .\nrow=4, col=20 -> @\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> @\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> a\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> .\nrow=6, col=20 -> @\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> %\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> &\nrow=7, col=12 -> &\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> .\nrow=7, col=20 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> .\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> .\nrow=8, col=19 -> .\nrow=8, col=20 -> .",

There's no immediate action to collect since the resources (gold shells and shark fangs) are located further above and possibly require movement closer to one of the piranha holes or around the shark and whale spawn points to access them safely.\n\nGiven the absence of threats in my immediate area, a useful first step would be moving upwards to explore and perhaps get closer to resource opportunities. Since the current strategy does emphasize movement to valuable areas while remaining cautious of potential threats, I will perform the action to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to navigate toward resource areas while observing any emerging threats to ensure I can adjust strategies as necessary.",
