Key interactions include:\n  - Taking damage from nebulae and bombs.\n  - Gaining health by interacting with planets.\n  - Transforming empty planets into busy planets.\n  - Deadly interactions with black holes and bombs, which can lead to game termination.\n- **Environment:** The level is bounded by walls, with pathways between them. The presence of planets and other interactive sprites encourages exploration and strategy in movement.\n\n#### Objectives \nThe primary objectives are:\n- Maintain the avatar\u2019s health points by avoiding damage.\n- Transform empty planets into busy planets, potentially to secure resources or health.\n- Navigate around hazards like black holes and bombs while utilizing the environment to your advantage.\n- The game ends when either the avatar is destroyed or all black holes are eliminated.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - Destroy (or eliminate the presence of) all black holes.\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar\u2019s health points drop to zero.\n  - The timer runs out after 1000 ticks.\n  - There are no remaining avatars after a game event occurs.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management:** Prioritize interacting with planets to regain health when needed. Since the avatar can only take limited damage, be vigilant about losing health from hazardous substances like nebulae and bombs.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards:** Stay away from bombs and black holes that can kill the avatar instantly. Be especially mindful of turret bombs, which have a probability of spawning damage.\n\n3. **Transforming Planets:** Explore the level to find empty planets and turn them into busy ones. Busy planets may provide beneficial resources or serve as safe zones.\n\n4. **Mobility and Positioning:** Navigate the level wisely to avoid being cornered by enemies or hazards. Use the walls to your advantage to break line-of-sight from turrets or other threats.\n\n5. **Timer Management:** Since the game has a timeout condition, keep an eye on your timer. Aim to clear black holes efficiently to avoid losing due to time constraints.\n\n6. **Leverage Turrets:** If safe, use the turrets to your advantage by drawing enemies into their attacking range while keeping a safe distance yourself.\n\nBy considering these strategies, players can enhance their performance while navigating the game\u2019s challenges effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To begin strategizing and proceeding with actions, it\u2019s important to first ascertain the state of the avatar\u2019s position and potential surroundings. This includes evaluating hazards and resources nearby, as well as making sure I\u2019m aligned with the overall strategy mentioned.\n\nAssuming initial exploration is necessary, and without a prior position reference provided, I will start with a directional action to assess the environment.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar to the left, which will help me understand if there are any immediate threats or beneficial resources (such as planets to interact with) in the vicinity. By moving left, I can better evaluate the overall layout of the level and adjust my strategy accordingly while sticking to the goal of avoiding hazards and transforming empty planets into busy ones.",
