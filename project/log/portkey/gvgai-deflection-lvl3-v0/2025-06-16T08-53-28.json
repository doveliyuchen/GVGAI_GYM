    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **top-down shooter** or **survival game**, set in a space-themed environment. Players control an 'avatar' that navigates a grid-like battlefield filled with various entities, such as bombs, planets, and enemy turrets, while managing health and other interactions.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Avatar Movement and Health**: \n   - The player controls an 'avatar' (spaceship) that can move through a 2D grid with a speed of 0.5.\n   - The avatar begins with 15 health points and can be healed by interacting with planets.\n\n2. **Interactions with Other Sprites**: \n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites, leading to different effects:\n     - **Health Loss**: Encountering nebulas or bombs can reduce health.\n     - **Transformation**: Interacting with empty planets converts them into busy planets.\n     - **Health Gain**: Interacting with planets restores health.\n     - **Timed Events**: Contact with atmosphere influences transformation mechanics over time.\n     - **Dangerous Environments**: Black holes and bombs can destroy the avatar.\n\n3. **Scoring System**: \n   - The player gains score points for successfully encountering black holes but can lose points and health from negative interactions.\n   - The player can earn additional (or perhaps avoid losing) points when managing encounters efficiently.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to survive and manage the avatar effectively while transforming empty planets to busy ones and avoiding or defeating turrets and obstacles, specifically by avoiding death resulting from health loss or black holes. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins if they manage to eliminate all black holes from the grid.\n- **Losing Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar\u2019s health drops to zero or if the timeout of 1000 units is reached without achieving the win condition.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Players should focus on avoiding hazardous sprites, especially bombs and black holes, to maintain health.\n  \n2. **Utilize Healing**: Players should actively seek out planets to recover health throughout gameplay. Transforming empty planets into busy planets should be prioritized since they may convey additional benefits.\n  \n3. **Plan Resource Management**: Effective navigation demands an awareness of the layout; players should optimize their movements to avoid unnecessary damage while ensuring they take the opportunities to heal.\n  \n4. **Strategic Use of Time**: Since the atmosphere and the transformation mechanics incorporate time, players should plan their movements to maximize the benefits from these effects when they trigger.\n  \n5. **Monitor Sprite Counter**: Keeping track of the black hole sprite count is critical. Players should prioritize actions that reduce this while managing health and avoiding enemy projectiles.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies and maintaining a cautious approach, players can enhance their chances of achieving victory in this game while minimizing the risk of early elimination.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To proceed effectively in the game, I need to understand the current position of the avatar in relation to the surrounding entities. I need to gather information on any hazards and opportunities such as nearby planets or black holes, as this will inform my choice of action.\n\nSince you have not provided the current state including the avatar's position or the layout with entities around it, I will default to taking a cautious approach that assumes my avatar may need to reposition itself for safety or strategic advantage.\n\nConsidering the overall strategy to avoid hazards and possibly engage with planets, I will initiate a movement action without any specific position information:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n \nFeedback: I chose to move left to explore that direction, aiming to reposition the avatar and assess what entities are in the vicinity. I expect to check if I can find safe planets to heal or avoid hazards if any are present.",
