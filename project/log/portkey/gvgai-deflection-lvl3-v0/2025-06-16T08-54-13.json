    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game appears to be a combination of strategy and action, likely fitting within the \"arcade-style\" or \"casual\" genre. The mechanics suggest it incorporates real-time decision-making and resource management.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites and Movement:** \n   - The player controls an avatar (spaceship) that moves around a grid-like map filled with different environmental elements (e.g., planets, turrets, blackholes).\n   - The avatar has health points and can interact with various sprites, including hazards (bombs, blackholes) and beneficial elements (planets, themes).\n   \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can lose health by colliding with enemies like bombs or nebulas.\n   - The avatar can gain health at planets or perform transformations from empty to busy planets.\n   - The blackhole acts as a passive portal, leading to a game-over scenario if encountered by the avatar.\n\n3. **Randomization and Timers:**\n   - Certain interactions (like the turret bombing) include probabilities, leading to a semi-randomized experience where players must adapt.\n   - A timer mechanic is included, where certain interactions can add time or modify the status of planets.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary goal is for the player to navigate through the grid and ensure their avatar survives while possibly attempting to clear all blackholes or maintain their avatar's health.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The game is won if the count of blackholes is reduced to zero.\n- **Loss:** The game is lost if the player's avatar's health drops to zero or they run out of time (timeout condition).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards:** \n   - Prioritize avoiding bombs, nebulas, and blackholes to manage the avatar\u2019s health effectively. Keep track of locations with higher bomb probability (turrets) and navigate away from them.\n\n2. **Focus on Health Management:**\n   - Regularly find and return to planets to replenish health. Ensure you understand the layout so you can easily access these health resources when needed.\n\n3. **Transform Planets:**\n   - Actively transform empty planets into busy ones to create a healthier environment or resources; this could help with health points or other benefits down the line.\n\n4. **Navigation and Positioning:**\n   - Use the map effectively to position your avatar for maximum efficacy. Stay aware of your surroundings to take strategic routes that reduce risk and enhance progress towards blackholes.\n\n5. **Monitor Timer:**\n   - Pay attention to timer mechanics associated with the atmosphere and ensure you manage time effectively to transform all necessary elements without rushing into danger.\n\n6. **Observe Patterns:**\n   - If turrets fire randomly, learn their patterns to dodge incoming missiles. Understanding enemy behavior can give you a significant strategic edge.\n\nBy maintaining good health, adapting to changing environments, and strategically managing the avatar\u2019s ability to acquire resources, you can enhance your chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To make a decision, I need to analyze the current state of my avatar's position, nearby environmental elements, and hazards to ensure my action aligns with the overall strategy of avoiding hazards, managing health, transforming planets, and monitoring the timer. \n\nSince my current position and the state are not provided, I will assume my avatar is stationary at the moment. I will need to choose a direction to start moving. \n\nGiven the strategy and mechanics, I will choose to move \"UP\" as a general action to explore and assess the environment. \n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to potentially avoid any immediate hazards below while gaining a better look at the area above, aligning with the strategy of avoiding danger and managing my overall position on the grid.",
