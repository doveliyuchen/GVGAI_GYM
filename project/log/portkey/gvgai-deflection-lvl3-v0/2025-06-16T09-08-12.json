    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game falls into the **action-adventure** genre with elements of **strategy** and **resource management**. Players must maneuver through a layout avoiding threats while managing health and utilizing various resources effectively.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game includes various sprites such as the avatar (player's character), nebula (which decreases health), blackholes (game over condition), planets (which can restore health), and turrets (which fire bombs).\n2. **Movement:** The avatar moves at a speed of 0.5 and can interact with various objects (e.g., empty planets transform into busy planets).\n3. **Health Management:** The avatar starts with a certain health number, and health points can be added or subtracted from interactions with sprites (e.g., bombs, planets).\n4. **Point System:** Points are managed through interactions; for instance, interacting with a blackhole results in a score increase, while health decreases from specific hazards.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- **Primary Objective:** Navigate through the levels, maintain the avatar's health, convert empty planets to busy ones, and ultimately survive against threats until blackholes are removed.\n- **Secondary Objective:** Score as high as possible by taking advantage of health-restoring planets and successfully avoiding or mitigating damage from nebulas and bombs.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game's win condition is fulfilled by eliminating all blackholes.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar's health reaches zero or if the avatar interacts with specific threats (like a bomb or a nebula).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Health Management:** Focus on finding and interacting with busy planets as often as possible to replenish the avatar's health. Since health can decrease quickly from nebulas or bombs, it\u2019s crucial to keep health points high.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards:** Navigate carefully around nebulas and bombs. It may be beneficial to approach turrets with caution as they can fire bombs that harm the avatar.\n\n3. **Planet Conversion:** Prioritize converting empty planets into busy ones early in the game. This ensures a steady source of health recovery as the level progresses.\n\n4. **Minimize Movement:** Since the avatar speed is relatively slow, plan moves carefully to avoid excessive backtracking or unnecessary interactions that could eat away at health points.\n\n5. **Time Management:** Be aware of the timeout limit of 1000. Make quick decisions to balance between exploring for resources and avoiding damaging interactions to ensure you meet the win condition before time runs out.\n\n6. **Utilize Blackholes:** If possible, use the presence of blackholes strategically\u2014perhaps maneuvering towards them at certain points when the health is low or when needing to trigger events in the game.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players should be able to navigate the game effectively while minimizing health loss and maximizing point accrual.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
