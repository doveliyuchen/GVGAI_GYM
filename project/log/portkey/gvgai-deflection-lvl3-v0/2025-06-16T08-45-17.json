    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **action-adventure** or **survival** genre with elements of **strategy**. Players navigate through a hazardous environment where timing and resource management are key.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various game objects in the environment, including the player's avatar, dangerous bombs, health planets, and static features like black holes and turrets.\n- **Movement**: The 'avatar' moves with a set speed and can interact with other sprites.\n- **Health Management**: The avatar has health points which can be both lost (through interactions with bombs, nebula, or black holes) and gained (by interacting with health planets).\n- **Transformation**: The avatar can interact with empty planets to transform them into busy planets, likely introducing new dynamics or abilities.\n- **Timed Events**: There\u2019s a timer feature associated with the atmosphere, which may influence gameplay or events.\n\n#### Objective\n- The primary objective is to keep the 'avatar' alive while navigating through the level.\n- The player must interact with various sprites to manage the avatar's health and utilize the environment effectively.\n- Ultimately, the goal for the player is to ensure that the number of black holes is zero when the game times out, thus winning the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: Achieved if the avatar survives the level until the black hole count reaches zero.\n- **Loss**: Conditions include the avatar's health reaching zero, the time limit (set at 1000) expiring, or if the avatar simultaneously dies as a consequence before achieving the above objective.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**:\n   - Prioritize collecting health from planets when necessary. Monitor health points and avoid unnecessary risks.\n  \n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: \n   - Be cautious around bombs and the black hole, as encounters with either can result in immediate death. Learn patterns and timings to navigate around these dangers effectively.\n\n3. **Utilizing Planets**:\n   - Engage with empty planets to convert them into busy planets. Assess whether they provide resources or benefits useful for survival or health.\n  \n4. **Passive Elements**: \n   - Use passive elements strategically. For instance, gather benefits from the atmosphere when feasible, as it can allow for time management regarding the level\u2019s overall pacing.\n\n5. **Timed and Spatial Awareness**: \n   - Maintain awareness of the timing and spatial dynamics of various interactions within the level. Avoid collisions with health-depleting sprites.\n  \n6. **Strategic Movements**: \n   - While moving to objectives (like empty planets), try to be aware of the potential for bombs to spawn or be attracted as you navigate\u2014plan movements accordingly.\n\nBy effectively managing health, avoiding hazards, and taking advantage of available resources, players can enhance their chances of surviving and successfully completing the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To devise a meaningful action, I need to analyze the game state, including my avatar's position, the location of health planets, bombs, black holes, and any other relevant elements in the environment. It's critical to determine if my previous action resulted in movement; if not, I need to consider a different strategy based on the current layout and objectives.\n\nHowever, as the current layout and the position of my avatar are not specified in your input, I will proceed with an example action that is strategically viable under normal circumstances, assuming I need to move towards potential health or safe spots:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nFeedback: I chose to move LEFT, hoping to navigate towards a safer area or collect health to manage my avatar's health effectively. I expect this action aligns well with my strategy of health management.",
