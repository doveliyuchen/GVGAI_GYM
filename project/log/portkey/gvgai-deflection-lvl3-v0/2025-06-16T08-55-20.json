    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n## Game Analysis\n\n### Genre\nThe game can be categorized as a **top-down shooter** or **strategy-based survival game**. The player's avatar navigates a grid-like level while interacting with various sprites (objects) to manage health, collect resources, and avoid hazards.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** \n  - The player controls an \"avatar\" (spaceship) with health points and movement speed.\n  - The game includes various static objects (background, nebula, black hole, planets) and dynamic threats (bombs, turrets).\n  - The player's avatar can transform empty planets into busy planets, potentially indicating resource management or health restoration.\n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar loses health when colliding with the nebula or bombs.\n  - The avatar can recover health by interacting with planets.\n  - The presence of a timer and transformation mechanics indicate time-sensitive actions.\n  - The black hole is a hazardous interaction that results in the avatar\u2019s destruction, but it can somehow impact the score positively upon being interacted with.\n  \n### Objective\n- The primary objective is to survive by maintaining the avatar's health while eliminating the black hole to win the game. The game ends if the player's avatar is destroyed, the black hole is removed, or if time runs out without completing the other objectives.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions:** \n  - Destroy the black hole (limit count of black holes to 0).\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The player's avatar reaches a health point count of 0.\n  - Time runs out (1000 units).\n  \n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management:** \n   - Focus on acquiring health by interacting with busy planets. Avoid collisions with bombs and the nebula, which subtract health.\n   \n2. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious of turrets and bombs. Since these have a cooldown and spawn randomly, carefully maneuver around them.\n\n3. **Timing is Key:**\n   - Use the atmosphere indicated mechanic to transform busy planets back to empty efficiently, using the gained time wisely.\n   \n4. **Prioritize the Black Hole:**\n   - The main goal is to eliminate the black hole. Find strategic pathways to it while managing health and avoiding damage.\n\n5. **Optimize Movements:**\n   - Leverage the movement speed of the avatar to navigate the level quickly, minimizing the time exposed to threats.\n\n6. **Monitor the Timer:**\n   - Keep a close eye on the countdown timer and complete necessary actions efficiently to prevent getting trapped by the time limit.\n\nBy balancing these strategies, players can navigate the challenges of the environment, manage their health effectively, and ultimately achieve their main objective of eliminating the black hole while avoiding destruction themselves.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To proceed effectively, I need to analyze the current state of the game, including the position of my avatar and the threats present in the environment. I will prioritize actions that enable health management, avoid hazards, and aim towards the objective of eliminating the black hole.\n\nSince the position of my avatar hasn't changed from the last state, I will assess the environment for any immediate threats and opportunities to move towards a busy planet (for health restoration) or toward the black hole.\n\nGiven the rules and strategy, I will determine my next action based on the positions I can move into. If there are no advantageous positions for health or direct engagement with the black hole, I will execute a simple maneuver to rotate but ultimately prepare for a substantive move next.\n\nLet's proceed with the optimal action considering the above analysis. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will potentially allow me to rotate left, and if it brings me closer to a healthier route or allows engagement with the black hole, it aligns perfectly with our strategic plan. I expect that after performing this action, I will reevaluate the state and make a more substantial move.",
