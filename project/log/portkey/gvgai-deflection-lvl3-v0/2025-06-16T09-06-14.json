    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to fall under the category of an action-adventure or possibly a puzzle game with elements of strategy. It involves navigating through a space-themed environment filled with various sprites that both help and hinder the player\u2019s progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various types of sprites are present, including the avatar (player character), hostile entities like bombs, passive sprites like planets and black holes, and turrets that spawn bombs.\n- **Health System:** The avatar has a health system with a maximum limit and can gain health from interacting with certain sprites (planets) and can lose health through interactions with others (nebulae and bombs).\n- **Interactions:** The avatar can transform empty planets to busy ones, which likely alters the game state in some way. The presence of black holes serves as both a danger (instantly killing the avatar) and an objective (the player wins if they manage to eliminate black holes).\n\n**Objectives:**\n- **Primary Objective:** The player needs to eliminate all black holes to win the game.\n- **Survival:** Maintain health while navigating the level and interacting with the environment.\n- **Resource Management:** The player needs to balance health gains from planets with the inherent dangers posed by bombs and nebulae.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The game is won if there are no remaining black holes.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if their avatar's health points drop to zero or if the timer runs out (indicated by a timeout of 1000 units).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards:** \n   - Steer clear of bombs and nebulae as much as possible since they deduct health points. Manage position to avoid getting trapped.\n\n2. **Planets as Resources:**\n   - Actively seek out empty planets to convert them to busy ones. Busy planets likely yield benefits essential for survival or scoring.\n   - Use busy planets to restore health when you have sustained damage.\n\n3. **Health Management:**\n   - Track your health points diligently. Engage with planets to boost health whenever possible and avoid confrontations with sprites that harm your avatar.\n  \n4. **Eliminate Black Holes:**\n   - Make black holes a priority target since they are critical to winning the game. Plan your moves so you are not cornered by hazards while approaching them.\n\n5. **Movement Strategy:**\n   - Since the avatar has a slow speed, use the layout effectively to navigate around hazards and towards objectives.\n   - Consider setting up pathways and routes that minimize exposure to high-risk sprites (like bombs and nebulae) while maximizing access to planets and black holes.\n\n6. **Time Management:**\n   - Be aware of the game timer. Plan your actions efficiently to eliminate black holes before the time runs out. Divide your attention between seeking black holes and managing health through interaction with sprites.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can improve their chances of success by balancing aggression towards objectives while maintaining their avatar's health and managing risks in the gameplay environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To proceed effectively in the game, I'll first need to evaluate the current state and my avatar's position to ensure my next action is strategic and aligns with the gameplay mechanics outlined above. Since my movements must be calculated to avoid hazards while aiming to eliminate black holes, I'll analyze the surroundings for threats and opportunities before selecting the appropriate action.\n\nWithout knowledge of the current state and position, I can suggest starting with a rotation action to check available targets or hazards around me and then move accordingly based on that assessment. It\u2019s likely best to start by moving in a direction where there are fewer dangers or towards empty planets to facilitate health recovery and to prepare for approaching black holes.\n\nGiven the absence of a predefined state, I'll begin with a slight directional rotation action to see if it allows me to assess my surroundings better.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should help me rotate left and see what\u2019s there to potentially access planets or encounter black holes, helping me align with the strategy of prioritizing objectives while maintaining my health.",
