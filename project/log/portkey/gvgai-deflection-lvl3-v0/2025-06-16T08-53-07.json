The presence of sprites that interact with one another indicates mechanics common in strategy-based games, where player positioning and timing play significant roles.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character (spaceship) can move and interact with other sprites, such as planets, bombs, and enemies (e.g., blackhole and turrets).\n   - **Health Points**: The avatar starts with 15 health points, which can be affected by interactions (e.g., losing health when hit by bombs or nebula).\n   - **Transformation**: The avatar can change empty planets into busy planets by interacting with them, potentially gaining health from them as well.\n   - **Timed Events**: The atmosphere sprite adds a timer when interacted with, suggesting time-limited challenges or transformations.\n\n2. **Enemies**:\n   - **Bombs**: These can attract the avatar's gaze and deal damage upon contact.\n   - **Blackholes**: If the avatar collides with this sprite, it results in an instant loss for the player.\n\n3. **Turrets**: They randomly drop bombs, meaning players must avoid these while navigating.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is likely to **survive and manage health** while transforming empty planets into busy ones or moving through levels effectively to avoid hazards. Players also aim to eliminate the blackholes to achieve victory.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Achieved by destroying or avoiding blackholes until there are no more left (SpriteCounter for blackhole reaches 0).\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  1. The avatar's health points reach 0.\n  2. The timeout limit is reached (1000).\n  3. Contact with a blackhole results in an immediate loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Manage Health**: Keep an eye on the avatar's health. Regularly seek out planets to gain health and avoid areas where bombs are likely to fall.\n2. **Plan Movements**: Avoid direct paths to turrets and blackholes. Create routes that minimize risks from bomb sprites.\n3. **Transform Planets**: Prioritize transforming empty planets to benefit from health points while creating strategic positioning against blackholes.\n4. **Use Time Wisely**: Interact with the atmosphere sprite strategically to gain time to accomplish objectives before the timeout occurs. Utilize the gained time to complete tasks.\n5. **Avoid High-Risk Areas**: Understand the level layout well. Identify areas with high bomb and turret concentrations and enact a strategy that bypasses these regions whenever possible.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can increase their chances of survival and winning the game while effectively navigating the hazards laid out in the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
