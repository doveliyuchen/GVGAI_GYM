    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThe game appears to be a mix of action and strategy, possibly fitting into the broad categories of **survival** and **resource management**. \n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The player controls an **avatar** (a spaceship) which has health points and can interact with various objects in the environment.\n- The game features **passive sprites** (such as planets and black holes) and **active sprites** (like bombs and turrets) that affect gameplay.\n- The avatar can either gain health points when interacting with certain planets or lose health points when interacting with bombs or a nebula.\n- The turret randomly drops bombs which pose a threat but can also distract the avatar.\n- The **black hole** serves as a type of passive entity that can kill the avatar upon contact.\n- There\u2019s a transformation mechanic involving empty and busy planets.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The goal is to have the **black hole** count reach zero while ensuring the avatar does not reach a count limit of zero (which indicates a loss). \n- Players must avoid interactions that would cause the avatar to lose all health, thus causing a game over. The avatar should also aim to collect health points from planets and minimize negative interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- You win if you manage to eliminate all instances of the black hole before the avatar is destroyed or before a timer of 1000 runs out.\n- You lose if the avatar's count drops to zero, the black hole's count is still present, or if you run out of time with the avatar still in play.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Health Management:**\n   - Prioritize interactions that add health points, such as engaging with planets when necessary.\n   - Avoid unnecessary conflicts with bombs and avoid nebulas, as these negatively impact health.\n\n2. **Positioning:**\n   - Carefully navigate the level design to limit contact with dangerous entities (bombs, black holes).\n   - Use the layout to your advantage by utilizing space; keep a safe distance from turrets when possible.\n\n3. **Collecting Resources:**\n   - Actively seek out empty planets to transform them into busy planets, as they are potentially beneficial to navigating your health.\n   - Monitor active sprites (like turrets) and their bomb drops without getting too close.\n\n4. **Timing and Patience:**\n   - Move cautiously, being mindful of the time constraint. The interaction with the atmosphere that transforms busy planets back to empty ones indicates time management is crucial. Maintaining an eye on the timer can help avoid panic moves.\n\n5. **Avoiding Overextension:**\n   - Engage with turrets and bombs only when absolutely necessary to distract or to create temporary safety.\n   - Predict their movements and try to position yourself favorably to minimize health loss.\n\nBy combining careful health management with strategic navigation and efficient resource collection, players can enhance their chances of a successful outcome in this engaging action-strategy title.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "Given that I need to maintain my avatar's health while also trying to eliminate the black hole, my priority should be to navigate carefully. However, if my avatar\u2019s position hasn't changed from the last state, it's crucial to reassess the environment and determine a new course of action.\n\nWithout knowing the current state, I can only provide a general strategy based on the mechanics outlined. First, I will attempt to turn in the direction that may lead to a safer spot, such as avoiding bombs or getting closer to a planet to regain health.\n\nFor my action, I will choose to move left (if that makes sense based on the current surroundings). \n\n```Action: 1```\n\nThis action should ideally help me reposition while keeping an eye on my health management strategy and evaluating any risks in the environment.",
