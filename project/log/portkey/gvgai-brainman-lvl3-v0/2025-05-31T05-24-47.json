    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here is an analysis of the game:\n\n### Genre\nThis game appears to fit into the **puzzle platformer** genre. Players likely navigate a 2D space to solve puzzles, collect items, and avoid enemies.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites/Objects**: \n  - **Avatar**: Player-controlled character.\n  - **Walls**: Static barriers that cannot be passed.\n  - **Doors and Keys**: The avatar must find keys to unlock doors, which may lead to progression or obstacles.\n  - **Gems**: Collectible items with different values indicating their importance or danger.\n  - **Boulders**: Static objects that can push the avatar back, adding a layer of movement strategy.\n  - **Exit**: A target that the avatar must reach to complete the level.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can collect keys, which change state when picked up.\n  - Different gem colors interact differently with the avatar (e.g., green kills the avatar while red gives a high score).\n  - The exit allows players to finish the level and receive points.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to collect enough points by collecting gems and reaching the exit. Each gem has different point values, and players must avoid negative interactions with certain objects (like the green gem).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Players lose when the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter for \u2018avatar\u2019 reaches zero).\n- Players win when the exit is reached and no more exits are left (SpriteCounter for \u2018exit\u2019 reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Carefully navigate the level to discover where the keys, gems, and the exit are located.\n2. **Prioritize Collectibles**: Focus on collecting gems to increase your score. Analyze which gems to collect first based on their score value (prefer red for high points, avoid green).\n3. **Key Management**: Collect keys to unlock doors but be cautious are you may encounter hazards. Keep track of how many keys you have and plan your moves accordingly.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay away from the green gem, which will result in a loss. Use the boulders to your advantage but be wary of their trajectory.\n5. **Endgame Strategy**: As you approach the exit, ensure no remaining threats (like lethal gems) could jeopardize your victory.\n\nBy following this analysis and strategy, players can optimize their gameplay to maximize scoring while navigating hazards and completing the level effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> d\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> d\nrow=2, col=2 -> d\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> d\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> d\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> d\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> d\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> d\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> d\nrow=6, col=5 -> d\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> d\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> d\nrow=6, col=12 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> d\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> d\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> a\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> d\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> d\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> d\nrow=11, col=9 -> d\nrow=11, col=10 -> d\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar 'a' is positioned at (10, 7). It is surrounded by walls or floor spaces and needs to navigate the map while considering key collectibles and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Analyzing the Current State:\n- **Nearby Threats**:\n  - Row 11 has walls surrounding the space which limits movement options.\n  - (9, 7) to (10, 8) are open but (10, 6) to (11, 6), and many parts of row 11 are walls.\n  \n- **Available Actions**:\n  - The positions adjacent (10, 6) left, (10, 8) right suggest possible moves. However, (9, 7) is empty.\n\n### Position Movement:\nThe avatar can move LEFT (10, 6) or RIGHT (10, 8), but the left position leads to a potential hazard (green gem) at (2, 6) later on, while moving to the right leads to an open wall. As the avatar's position doesn't change, the objective should focus on safe movement.\n\n### Action Decision:\nMoving **down** to (11, 7) would be safer and allows progression since it may give a clearer route for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis movement will allow me to push down into the next row while avoiding immediate threats and explore further without death hazards.",
