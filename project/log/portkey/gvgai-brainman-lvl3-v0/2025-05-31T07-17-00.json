It incorporates elements of exploration, item collection, and strategic movement within a grid-like environment.\n\n**Game Mechanics**\n1. **Movement and Interaction:** Players control an avatar that navigates through a grid filled with various sprites (objects). The player interacts with different sprites, which can either be passive (like walls and doors) or interactive (like keys, gems, and boulders).\n  \n2. **Sprite Types:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** These include walls, floors, and doors \u2013 they cannot be moved or interacted with in a way that changes their position.\n   - **Movable Objects:** The avatar can interact with certain objects (like keys and boulders) which can affect their state or the game environment.\n   - **Collectibles:** Gems and keys must be collected to progress. The gems have different point values (green = 1, blue = 2, red = 5).\n\n3. **Transformation and Killing:** Picking up certain items changes the avatar\u2019s form (e.g., transforming into a key-missile). Additionally, interacting with specific objects can \"kill\" the avatar or other sprites, often resulting in a score adjustment.\n\n4. **Exit Mechanism:** The primary method of exit from the level is by reaching an exit sprite, which also increases the player's score.\n\n**Objective**\n- The primary goal is to navigate through the level, collect keys and gems, and ultimately reach the exit point while maximizing the score through collectibles and strategic interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the exit sprite is reached, and there are no avatars remaining (indicated by a SpriteCounter reaching zero).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar count reaches zero, which implies that the player has lost all avatars available for play.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Explore Wisely:** Begin by exploring the map layout to understand the positions of doors, boulders, and collectibles, noting which paths are blocked and which are clear.\n\n2. **Collect Keys and Gems:** Prioritize collecting all available keys and gems as these increase your score. Since gems often have a varying score value, try to collect higher-value gems (like red) when possible.\n\n3. **Use Items Strategically:** Use the keys you collect wisely; transforming them into key-missiles can help affect walls or doors strategically. Identify which doors you can unlock and try to access areas that will yield more collectibles.\n\n4. **Consider Risk and Reward:** Be mindful of the gems that can kill your avatar. Weigh the scores of gems (especially high-value ones) against the risk of losing an avatar.\n\n5. **Plan Your Exit:** After gathering as many points as possible through collectibles, focus on reaching the exit. Make sure you have the key available to unlock doors leading to the exit.\n\n6. **Continuous Evaluation:** Always evaluate whether the current sprite or item in your possession is beneficial to your progress. If interactions can backtrack or undo movements, consider how best to utilize this mechanic to enhance your pathway to the exit while maximizing your score.\n\nBy using these strategies, you can effectively navigate the game\u2019s challenges, optimize for points, and ensure a successful completion of the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> d\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> d\nrow=2, col=2 -> d\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> d\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> d\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> d\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> d\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> d\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> d\nrow=6, col=5 -> d\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> d\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> d\nrow=6, col=12 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> d\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> d\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> a\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> d\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> d\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> d\nrow=11, col=9 -> d\nrow=11, col=10 -> d\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d",
