The objective revolves around navigating through a level filled with obstacles, collectibles (gems and keys), and interactions between various sprites (game elements).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** Various types are introduced, including the player avatar, gems (with different point values), keys, doors, walls, and different types of interactive elements like boulders.\n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can move around the environment, interact with other sprites, and experience outcomes based on these interactions (e.g., collecting items, overcoming obstacles).\n3. **Transformation:** The key can transform into a missile variant (keym) when picked up, which then allows interaction with certain objects, such as doors.\n4. **Scoring System:** Points are awarded for collecting different colored gems and for successfully exiting the level.\n5. **Undo Mechanism:** Some interactions allow for \"undoing\" previous actions, suggesting a need for planning and strategic thinking.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to reach the **exit sprite** while maximizing your score by collecting gems and avoiding dangers (such as the green gem, which has a detrimental effect).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Achieved when the avatar reaches the exit, and the exit sprite count reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** Occurs when the avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Prioritize Collectibles:**\n   - Focus on collecting red and blue gems first, as they provide higher scores (5 and 2 points, respectively).\n   - Avoid the green gem because it can eliminate the avatar.\n\n2. **Manage Key Usage:**\n   - Collect the key when possible to unlock doors but be mindful when interacting with the keym, as it may lead to a game-over situation when used improperly against doors.\n\n3. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Analyze the layout and think ahead about how boulders can be used to block or redirect your path.\n   - Make use of the undo interaction wisely. If you make a move that seems unfavorable, consider using the undo mechanism.\n\n4. **Watch for Hazards:**\n   - Constantly check for any potential hazards (like the green gem) and plan a route that avoids them.\n   - Be cautious of walls and doors, as they can restrict movement.\n\n5. **Ultimate Goal:** \n   - Always keep the exit in mind while navigating the level, balancing between collecting points and moving towards the goal efficiently.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the game, achieving a high score while reaching the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> d\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> d\nrow=2, col=2 -> d\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> d\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> d\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> d\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> d\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> d\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> d\nrow=6, col=5 -> d\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> d\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> d\nrow=6, col=12 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> d\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> d\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> a\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> d\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> d\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> d\nrow=11, col=9 -> d\nrow=11, col=10 -> d\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d",

Moving left to (10, 1) will allow collection of this item.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action aims to collect the keym, providing more options for navigation and strategic play as per our objective.",
