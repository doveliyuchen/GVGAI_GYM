This genre typically combines elements of puzzle-solving with platforming mechanics, where players navigate through levels, interact with objects, and overcome challenges.\n\n#### Mechanics\nThe game utilizes a grid-based layout where various sprites play a role in the gameplay:\n\n- **Sprites** include the player (avatar), various types of gems, keys, a door, and walls.\n- Interactions among these sprites dictate the behavior of the game. For instance:\n  - The avatar can pick up keys, which transform into key missiles.\n  - The player can receive damage from various colored gems (green, blue, and red) based on their score values.\n  - The player can pass through walls with the help of keys.\n  - The exit provides victory points when reached.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objectives of the game are:\n1. Collect and manage keys (and their key missiles) to interact with doors and walls for progressing through the level.\n2. Avoid or obtain specific gems to maximize score while maintaining the avatar's health.\n3. Reach the exit to complete the level while achieving a high score.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit, thereby reducing the exit sprite counter to 0.\n- **Losing Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite counter (representing player lives or health) reaches 0, indicating the avatar has been defeated.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Before taking action, visualize the path to the exit, noting where you can safely collect keys and gems while avoiding hazards. \n\n2. **Prioritize Key Management**: Collect keys wisely, as they are essential for opening doors to access new areas. Switching between key types (key and key missile) based on the situation can be a tactical advantage.\n\n3. **Gem Strategy**: Keep track of the colors of gems you encounter. Given their different point values and the risk involved, decide whether to collect or avoid them strategically based on your current health and score objectives.\n\n4. **Use Boulders Strategically**: Boulders can bounce off walls or your avatar and may play a role in puzzle elements or creating safe paths, so use them effectively to manipulate the environment.\n\n5. **Watch Your Health**: Keep an eye on your score and health; collect higher-value gems with caution since they can damage the avatar. Always strategize on when to engage with these gems.\n\n6. **Explore Thoroughly**: Take time to explore the environment for hidden gems or keys that may be critical for advancing in the level. \n\n7. **Exit Planning**: Once you have collected enough points through gems or have found the exit, plan your final moves to minimize risk while heading to the exit.\n\nBy following this strategic framework, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the level while achieving the highest possible score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> d\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> d\nrow=2, col=2 -> d\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> d\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> d\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> d\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> d\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> d\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> d\nrow=6, col=5 -> d\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> d\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> d\nrow=6, col=12 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> d\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> d\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> a\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> *\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> @\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> d\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> d\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> d\nrow=11, col=9 -> d\nrow=11, col=10 -> d\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d",

    "content": "The avatar is currently positioned at (10, 3) on the game grid, surrounded by different types of sprites, including keys, walls, and various gems. The exit is located at (1, 1) and there is a door at (1, 2) that may be necessary to pass through to reach the exit.\n\nGiven the avatar's current position and the objective to reach the exit while maximizing score and avoiding hazards, I need to assess the immediate options available:\n\n1. **Up (10, 3) to (9, 3)**: This space is empty (.), allowing safe movement.\n2. **Down (10, 3) to (11, 3)**: This space is a wall (d), so moving here is not possible.\n3. **Left (10, 3) to (10, 2)**: This space is empty (.), allowing safe movement.\n4. **Right (10, 3) to (10, 4)**: This space is empty (.), allowing safe movement.\n\nSince moving up, left, or right is possible, I should consider moving upwards to get closer to the exit at (1, 1) while avoiding obstacles. Moving up may also give a better view of the layout to plan further moves.\n\nBased on the exploration strategy, I will choose to move **up** to potentially navigate towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving upwards allows me to continue progressing toward the exit while exploring the surrounding area further. I expect this move will help clear the path to the exit.",
