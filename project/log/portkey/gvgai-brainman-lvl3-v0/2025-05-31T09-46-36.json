The aim appears to be collecting items and reaching an exit while managing scores related to different sprites.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor**: The base layer where the avatar moves (this is immovable).\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character capable of moving around the map and interacting with various elements.\n   - **Gems**: Different colored gems that represent points; collecting them influences your score.\n   - **Keys and Doors**: Keys can be transformed into a missile type when picked up, which can interact with doors.\n   - **Boulder**: Can bounce the avatar back, and its interactions with other elements allow for undoing previous moves.\n   - **Exit**: Represents the goal; reaching it ends the game and provides substantial points.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, doors, and other sprites, changing its state or position.\n   - Picking up a key transforms it, allowing for further interactions with other objects, like the door.\n   - Collecting gems yields scores based on their color (value varies \u2014 red gives high points, green is the least).\n   - Movement is necessary, as players must navigate through walls and avoid negative interactions (for instance, red and green gems kill the avatar).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the levels, collect as many gems as possible, and ultimately reach the exit sprite to win the game, while managing overall health and point score through interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully reach the exit sprite while ensuring the avatar remains intact (not killed by other sprites) and ensuring at least one exit sprite remains.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar is killed (sprite count drops to zero), the game is lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Prioritize Safety**: Avoid immediate threats \u2014 when navigating the level, stay clear of red and green gems to ensure the avatar's survival. Focus on moving towards safe routes.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Collect keys strategically to unlock doors while keeping track of how many gems you can scoop up without risking your avatar's health.\n\n3. **Maximize Point Collection**: Plan your route to collect higher value gems (red > blue > green) while ensuring that you don't set yourself up for future failure.\n\n4. **Boulder Utility**: Use the boulders to reposition yourself or create safe passageways. They can also help undo problematic moves if you collision with them.\n\n5. **Exit Awareness**: Always keep the exit in mind; prioritize reaching it as it offers a significant score change. Create paths that lead towards the exit while collecting gems along the way.\n\n6. **Experiment with Keys**: Transform keys into the missile type judiciously to break down barriers (doors) and clear paths as necessary.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and understanding the mechanics, players can effectively navigate through levels, optimize their scores, and reach their objectives successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> d\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> d\nrow=2, col=2 -> d\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> d\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> d\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> d\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> d\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> d\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> d\nrow=6, col=5 -> d\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> d\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> d\nrow=6, col=12 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> d\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> d\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> a\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> &\nrow=10, col=7 -> @\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> d\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> d\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> d\nrow=11, col=9 -> d\nrow=11, col=10 -> d\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d",
