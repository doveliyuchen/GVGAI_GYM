    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, let's break down the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a possible strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall into the **puzzle platformer** genre. Players control an avatar navigating a 2D grid-based environment while solving puzzles involving interaction with various sprites (game objects like keys, doors, and gems). \n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game involves several sprites with specific interactions:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character navigating the environment.\n   - **Key and Door**: Keys unlock doors, and there are two types of keys: a passive key and a missile key.\n   - **Gems**: Killing the avatar leads to score changes based on the type of gem encountered.\n   - **Boulders**: The boulders can bounce off walls and potentially affect avatar movement.\n   - **Exit**: Reaching the exit will end the level positively.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can transform a key into a \"missile key\" when collected.\n   - A direct interaction with the door while holding the \"missile key\" leads to both objects being removed and adding points to the score.\n   - Collecting different colors of gems also affects the score, where red gives the highest points.\n\n3. **Obstacles**:\n   - Walls prevent movement, while the boulders can interact with both the wall and the avatar.\n   - Encountering a green gem immediately kills the avatar, resulting in a loss.\n\n### Objectives\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level effectively to reach the exit. Players must collect keys, avoid harmful gems, and utilize the boulder mechanics to push through obstacles to reach the exit.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the exit sprite is reached, which also grants the player points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, likely due to colliding with harmful gems (especially the green one).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Path**: Before moving, assess the layout to determine a safe route to the exit, avoiding gems that can harm the avatar.\n2. **Utilize Keys Wisely**: Gather keys and use the \"missile key\" strategically to unlock doors while keeping an eye on the possibility of re-encountering the collected key type.\n3. **Manage Boulders**: Use boulders to navigate tricky areas, bounce them off walls if necessary, and protect yourself from hazardous interactions.\n4. **Collect for Score**: While reaching the exit is paramount, collecting high-scoring gems can be beneficial for any required next stages or levels.\n5. **Test Interactions**: Experiment with different interactions between sprites to better understand the mechanics (e.g., how keys and doors interact or how boulders affect movement).\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics of the different sprites, players can enhance their gameplay experience and increase their chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\nboulder -> '#'\ndoor -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreen -> '&'\nkey -> '*'\nred -> 'b'\nwall -> 'd'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> d\nrow=0, col=1 -> d\nrow=0, col=2 -> d\nrow=0, col=3 -> d\nrow=0, col=4 -> d\nrow=0, col=5 -> d\nrow=0, col=6 -> d\nrow=0, col=7 -> d\nrow=0, col=8 -> d\nrow=0, col=9 -> d\nrow=0, col=10 -> d\nrow=0, col=11 -> d\nrow=0, col=12 -> d\nrow=1, col=0 -> d\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> d\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> d\nrow=2, col=0 -> d\nrow=2, col=1 -> d\nrow=2, col=2 -> d\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> d\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> d\nrow=3, col=0 -> d\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> d\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> d\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> d\nrow=4, col=0 -> d\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> d\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> d\nrow=5, col=0 -> d\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> d\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> d\nrow=6, col=0 -> d\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> d\nrow=6, col=5 -> d\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> d\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> d\nrow=6, col=12 -> d\nrow=7, col=0 -> d\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> d\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> d\nrow=8, col=0 -> d\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> d\nrow=9, col=0 -> d\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> d\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> d\nrow=10, col=0 -> d\nrow=10, col=1 -> &\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> d\nrow=11, col=0 -> d\nrow=11, col=1 -> d\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> d\nrow=11, col=4 -> d\nrow=11, col=5 -> d\nrow=11, col=6 -> d\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> d\nrow=11, col=9 -> d\nrow=11, col=10 -> d\nrow=11, col=11 -> d\nrow=11, col=12 -> d",
