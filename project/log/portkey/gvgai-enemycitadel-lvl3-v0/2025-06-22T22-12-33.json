The interaction mechanics suggest a focus on navigating through obstacles and solving puzzles using various elements (such as crates and boulders).\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - The game utilizes different types of sprites, including walls, avatars (the player), crates, boulders, enemies, holes, and goals.\n   - Each sprite has specific interactions that dictate how they behave when they come into contact with each other.\n\n2. **Movement & Interaction**:\n   - The **avatar** can move around the level and interacts with other sprites.\n   - Crates can be used to push and interact with other objects, while boulders can bounce off the avatar and other crates.\n   - The **enemy** sprite can disrupt the player's progress, causing the avatar to step back or lose health points.\n\n3. **Health System**:\n   - The avatar has a defined health point system (initially at 30), which decreases when it collides with enemies.\n\n4. **Scoring**:\n   - Players can score points by destroying certain sprites (like crates or achieving a goal).\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to navigate the level, avoid enemies, and utilize crates and boulders to reach the goal while minimizing the loss of health. Players must strategically use crates and boulders to clear pathways, defeat opponents, and achieve the goal (represented by the \"door\" sprite).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins upon reaching the goal sprite, which results in scoring points and clearing the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points reach zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Health**:\n   - Maintain the avatar's health as the top priority. Avoid encounters with enemies whenever possible and plan moves to prevent unnecessary damage.\n\n2. **Use Crates Wisely**:\n   - Leverage crates as tools to push or block enemies and to create paths to navigate through the level. Crates can also be stacked to manipulate their positioning strategically.\n\n3. **Boulder Exploitation**:\n   - Use boulders effectively to create chain reactions. For instance, pushing a boulder into other sprites (such as crates or enemies) may clear paths or eliminate threats.\n\n4. **Plan Movement**:\n   - Think ahead with each move. Avoid moving into areas where you might get cornered or trapped by enemies, and ensure that paths to the goal remain open.\n\n5. **Level Layout Awareness**:\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout (as indicated above). Knowing safe zones, enemy spawn points, and locations of crucial sprites (like crates and goals) can provide strategic advantages.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different interactions. Understanding how the sprites react can lead to discovering optimal pathways to victory.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game combines strategic puzzle-solving with fast-paced navigation and enemy avoidance. By focusing on interaction dynamics, planning moves, and using objects in the environment effectively, players can ultimately progress through levels and achieve victory while keeping their avatar healthy.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> a\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",
