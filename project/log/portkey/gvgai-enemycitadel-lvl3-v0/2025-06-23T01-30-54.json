    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the description provided, here's an analysis of the game's rules, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-platformer, where players navigate through a maze-like environment, solving puzzles to progress toward a goal.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Avatars and Sprites**: Players control an \"avatar\" with health points and can interact with various sprites (background, holes, crates, boulders, walls, enemies, etc.). \n2. **Interaction System**: The interactions define how the avatar and other sprites respond to each other:\n   - Collision with walls or holes causes the avatar to step back.\n   - Boulders can bounce off the avatar and affect other sprites (like crates).\n   - Crates and boulders can destroy other sprites or interact with each other.\n   - The avatar can take damage from enemies.\n3. **Scoring and Health**: Players gain score points by defeating opponents or completing objectives (such as reaching the goal). The avatar's health decreases when it collides with enemies.\n\n### Objectives:\n- **Primary Objective**: Reach the \"goal\" sprite to win the game, gaining scoring points and avoiding enemy collisions.\n- **Secondary Objective**: Defeat enemies by using the environment (crates, boulders) to survive and maintain health points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite and ensuring that no goal sprites are left (SpriteCounter for goals becomes 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points reach 0 (SpriteCounter for avatar becomes 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Understand the layout of walls, crates, boulders, and enemy positions. This facilitates planning safe routes to the goal.\n2. **Use Environment**: Make strategic use of crates and boulders to clear paths or eliminate enemies. Certain interactions can lead to defeating enemies indirectly by pushing them into holes.\n3. **Avoid Direct Conflict**: It's vital to avoid direct engagements with enemies whenever possible. Use crates or boulders to block or push enemies away rather than confrontation.\n4. **Keep Health in Mind**: As the avatar has limited health points, prioritize staying away from enemies and plan moves carefully to retain health as long as possible.\n5. **Score Maximization**: Try to defeat as many enemies and reach the goal efficiently. Sometimes, engaging with the environment to kill them can yield points while minimizing the risk to the avatar.\n6. **Plan Moves**: With the constraints set by interaction rules, think a few steps ahead to ensure that the avatar\u2019s movements do not result in a direct collision with enemies or making ineffective moves.\n\nBy focusing on using the environmental mechanics and avoiding direct confrontations, players can navigate through the game efficiently and achieve the primary objective of reaching the goal sprite.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> a\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",
