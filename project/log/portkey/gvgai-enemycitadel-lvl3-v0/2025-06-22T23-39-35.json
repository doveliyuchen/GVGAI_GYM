Players must navigate the environment using various objects to achieve specific goals while avoiding or neutralizing enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Objects**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character with health points that can be damaged by enemies.\n   - **Walls**: Immovable barriers that block movement.\n   - **Holes**: Specific zones (square and round) that can interact with physical objects in particular ways.\n   - **Crates and Boulders**: Used to navigate and solve puzzles while also serving as potential hazards.\n   - **Enemies**: NPCs that can damage the player upon contact.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, crates, boulders, enemies, and goals, each interaction having specific consequences (e.g., bouncing back, losing health points, or scoring).\n   - Crates can be used to manipulate boulders and enemies.\n   - Certain combinations of crate and hole interactions result in scoring points.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite, accumulating points by eliminating enemies and interacting with objects in the environment. The player needs to avoid losing all health points and should manage interactions with the various objects wisely.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**:\n  - The player wins by successfully reaching the goal (when the avatar touches the goal, resulting in a score change of +5).\n  \n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - The player loses if the avatar\u2019s health points reach zero (the avatar's sprite counter reaches a limit of 0).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Navigation and Avoidance**:\n   - Prioritize keeping distance from enemies to avoid health loss. Use walls and other sprites as barriers.\n   \n2. **Use Crates and Boulders Wisely**:\n   - Utilize crates to push boulders strategically towards round holes, which gives points and clears the path. \n   - Avoid unnecessary contact with crates or boulders that may cause you to bounce back, disrupting your movement.\n\n3. **Plan Interactions**:\n   - Before making movements, try to predict how different objects will interact. For example, aiming to push an enemy into a hole or crate should be carefully planned to avoid personal harm.\n\n4. **Health Management**:\n   - Keep track of your health points and avoid risky movements that could lead to damage. If health gets low, back off from encounters if possible.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**:\n   - Focus on utilizing boulders and crates to eliminate enemies where possible to maximize score, while also aiming to reach the goal as quickly as possible.\n\nBy strategically managing the interactions and understanding the layout of the level, the player can effectively work towards reaching the goal while avoiding enemy attacks and preserving health points.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",

From analyzing the map, I see that there are enemies in the vicinity that I should avoid for health preservation, considering the strategy of keeping distance from them.\n\nI also observe the goal (%), which is at (8, 12) and within reach, but I need to navigate carefully due to adjacent enemies ($) located around (8, 6), (8, 8), and (9, 6).\n\nTo proceed strategically, I will move UP to (5, 9) to gain a better perspective and potentially find a safer path to the goal. This action aims to avoid direct encounters with enemies while also evaluating potential future moves to get closer to the goal safely.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to reposition the avatar for a more strategic overview while aiming to maintain distance from enemies.
