The mechanics involve navigation through a level, interactions with objects and the environment, and the goal is to score points and overcome enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - **Player Avatar:** Controlled by the player, capable of moving and interacting with other sprites.\n   - **Immovable Objects:** Includes walls, holes, and the goal, which cannot be moved but can affect the avatar's movement.\n   - **Passive Objects:** Such as boulders and crates that can bounce or kill other entities when interacted with.\n   - **Enemy NPCs:** Randomly moving entities that subtract health points when the avatar collides with them.\n\n2. **Health System:** \n   - The player starts with 30 health points, which can be decreased through encounters with enemies.\n   \n3. **Scoring System:**\n   - Points are scored by successfully interacting with specific objects (e.g., killing crates or boulders in the correct contexts) and reaching the goal.\n\n4. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no goal sprites left in the level (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n   - **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar's health points drop to zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Objective:\nThe player's primary goal is to navigate the level, interact with various sprites to score points (mainly by eliminating crates, boulders, and enemies), and reach the goal sprite while keeping their health intact.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Stay Aware of Health:** Monitor your avatar\u2019s health points and avoid unnecessary conflicts with enemies. Use strategic movements to sidestep or redirect enemies away from your path.\n   \n2. **Utilize Objects Wisely:** Make use of boulders and crates to your advantage. Since they can interact with each other and other sprites, think ahead about how pushing these objects can create pathways or eliminate enemies.\n   \n3. **Plan Interactions:** Understanding the interactions is key to progressing through the level:\n   - Use crates to block enemies or bounce them towards walls so they step back and don't hit you.\n   - Aim to use boulders to eliminate enemies or score points by creating interactions that allow for double kills with round and square holes.\n\n4. **Prioritize Goal Completion:** While scoring points is valuable, your main objective should be reaching the goal. Devise a route that allows you to eliminate any threats while still moving closer to the exit.\n\n5. **Avoid Crowded Areas:** If multiple enemies are present, it's often safer to navigate around them or use crates/boulders to manipulate their positions, rather than confronting them directly.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and understanding the interactions and mechanics well, players can navigate the challenges effectively while aiming for a high score and a successful level completion.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> a\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> @\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",

Your current health is 30, and moving downwards to (5, 9) or left to (4, 8) does not involve interacting with any enemies, keeping your health intact.\n2. The primary goal is to navigate towards the goal located at (8, 12) while managing interactions with boulders, crates, and avoiding enemies.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the immediate surroundings, moving down to (5, 9) opens up more empty space and could allow for further movement options in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar downwards. I expect to see more potential options in the next state, given that (5, 9) is empty.",
