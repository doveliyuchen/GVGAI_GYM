It combines elements of strategy, problem-solving, and action, featuring multiple sprite interactions where players must navigate through obstacles and enemies to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites:**\n    - **Avatar:** The player character with health points, able to move and interact with the environment.\n    - **Enemies:** Act as obstacles, reducing the avatar's health upon contact.\n    - **Crates and Boulders:** These can be manipulated to solve puzzles or defeat enemies.\n    - **Holes (Square and Round):** These are areas players must navigate around or use strategically, as some interactions will lead to kills or traps.\n    - **Goal:** Represents the end point players must reach in order to score points and potentially win the game.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can interact with walls, crates, and boulders, often resulting in bouncing back or killing sprites.\n  - Collisions with enemies reduce health points.\n  - Moving crates and boulders can help to eliminate enemies or navigate through the level.\n  - Successfully reaching the goal increases the score.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all obstacles (including enemies) and reach the goal to score points. The player must manage their health while navigating the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win:** The game is won when the goal sprite is eliminated (SpriteCounter for goals reaches 0).\n- **Loss:** The game is lost when the avatar's health points reach zero (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment:** \n   Start by surveying the level layout visually. Identify the locations of obstacles, enemies, and the goal.\n\n2. **Health Management:**\n   Keep track of the avatar's health points. Avoid encounters with enemies unless you're certain to eliminate them without sustaining damage.\n\n3. **Utilize Crates and Boulders:**\n   Move crates strategically to block enemy paths or to create paths to the goal. Use boulders to bounce away from enemies when necessary. They can also be used to remove obstacles when pushed into holes.\n\n4. **Puzzles and Navigation:**\n   Think ahead about the sequence of moves. Some interactions can yield significant score changes, so prioritize actions that lead to eliminating enemies or moving toward the goal.\n\n5. **Avoid Deadlocks:**\n   Be cautious not to box yourself in with crates or get stuck in positions where moving becomes impossible, which may lead to a loss.\n\n6. **Plan Enemy Interactions:**\n   Understand how enemies respond to the environment. If possible, trick them into attacking crates or getting stuck against walls to avoid damage to the avatar.\n\n7. **Exploit Scoring Wins:**\n   Focus on obtaining the score boosts from reaching the goal and interacting with holes for kills. Make sure to maximize these opportunities as you clear the level.\n\nBy following this strategy and understanding the game mechanics thoroughly, players can effectively navigate the puzzles, manage challenges, and ultimately succeed in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> @\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",
