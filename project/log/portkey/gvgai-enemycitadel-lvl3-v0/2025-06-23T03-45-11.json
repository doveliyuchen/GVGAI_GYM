Players must navigate through a challenging environment using logic and strategy while also avoiding enemies to achieve their objectives.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n1. **Sprites**: The game features a variety of sprites, including walls, enemies, crates, boulders, and the player's avatar. Each has specific properties affecting interactions:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Background, wall, squarehole, roundhole, and goal.\n   - **Moving Avatar**: The player character with health points.\n   - **Passive Objects**: Crates and boulders can be pushed or manipulated.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - Players can move the avatar to interact with objects and solve puzzles.\n   - Boulders can eliminate enemies or be strategically positioned for further interactions.\n   - Crates can also be stacked or moved to trigger events, such as eliminating sprites.\n   - The avatar's health can be decreased by contact with enemies.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe main goal is to reach the goal sprite while eliminating various obstacles (enemies and specific sprites) along the way to achieve a high score. The player earns points by moving boulders and crates into squareholes and roundholes, as well as by reaching the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar successfully reaches the goal sprite, resulting in scoring 5 points. Additionally, all goal sprites must be cleared for the win condition to be satisfied.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends in loss if the avatar's health points reach zero (i.e., the avatar is eliminated).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation and Planning**: Players should assess the map layout before taking action. Identify the location of the goal, enemies, and potential obstacles. Map out a path that minimizes danger and maximizes interactions with boulders and crates.\n\n2. **Enemy Avoidance**: Since enemies can reduce the avatar's health, it\u2019s crucial to avoid direct contact. Push crates strategically into enemies to eliminate or push them back, using boulders for any necessary interactions with stationary obstacles.\n\n3. **Efficient Use of Crates and Boulders**: Leverage crates and boulders to facilitate movements and eliminate obstacles. Understand that crates and boulders can trigger positives (such as scoring) or negatives (like blocking paths or activating enemies) depending on interactions.\n\n4. **Health Management**: Maintain the avatar\u2019s health by avoiding unnecessary encounters with enemies. Monitor health points closely; if health is low, retreat to a safer area until the situation improves.\n\n5. **Strategic Moves**: When pushing boulders or crates, consider the consequences of each move carefully. Setup positions to potentially eliminate enemies with next actions, and understand the undo mechanism that may affect previous moves.\n\nBy carefully planning each step and utilizing the mechanics effectively, players can navigate through levels, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach their goals while maximizing their score and minimizing damage.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> a\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar 'a' is located at row 6, column 7. Below this position, there is a goal sprite '%' at row 8, column 12 which is our objective. The avatar can interact with crates '#' and boulders '@' present nearby.\n\nFrom this position, let\u2019s consider the most strategic action to advance. The avatar currently has some moving options and avoiding enemies is critical since they can reduce health points. Notably, there are enemies '$' within a vicinity that need to be navigated around.\n\nThe best course of action is to move **down** from the current position (row 6, col 7 to row 7, col 7). This action will allow the avatar to navigate closer to an area where they might be able to engage with crates or boulders and eventually line up for the goal.\n\nThus, I choose the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action to bring me closer to the goal and allow for the exploration of additional strategic moves.",
