    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, we can perform the following analysis of this game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-adventure game with elements of strategy and resource management. The presence of mechanics like moving the avatar, interacting with obstacles, and enemies suggests it involves strategic planning and tactical execution.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - Various types of sprites are defined, which include immovable objects (walls, holes, background), passive objects (crates, boulders), and a moving avatar.\n   - The avatar has health points and can interact with other sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, crates, boulders, enemies, and the goal. Each sprite can perform specific actions when they come into contact with each other.\n   - Key interactions include:\n     - The avatar bounces back when hitting walls and crates.\n     - Crates can bounce off each other and affect other objects like boulders and enemies.\n     - Crates can defeat enemies when placed in specific positions.\n     - The avatar loses health when colliding with enemies.\n     - The game can provide score changes based on certain actions (like defeating enemies or reaching the goal).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objectives of the game involve:\n- Reaching the goal (represented by the goal sprite) while managing interactions with enemies and obstacles.\n- Collecting scores through interactions, particularly through defeating enemies and using the crates strategically.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero, indicating that the avatar has successfully reached the goal, scoring a total of 5 points in the process.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points reach zero, implying defeat due to enemy interactions.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement and Positioning**: Carefully maneuver the avatar to avoid enemies while trying to reach the goal. Use crates and boulders to create barriers or obstacles in the path of enemies.\n2. **Using Crates Effectively**:\n   - Utilize crates to defeat enemies by placing them strategically in square or round holes.\n   - Create chain reactions with crates to manage multiple obstacles or enemies simultaneously.\n3. **Health Management**: Monitor health points closely and avoid confrontations with enemies unless there's a clear strategy to defeat them using crates.\n4. **Explore and Solve Puzzles**: The level layout suggests a need to explore different paths (like walls and obstacles) to find the safest route to the goal while solving puzzles created by sprite interactions.\n5. **Maximize Score**: Engage in as many score-enhancing actions as possible (e.g., defeating enemies with crates) while moving toward the goal, but don't sacrifice health in the process.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game encourages players to think strategically about movement, resource management (in terms of crates), and timing. Successfully navigating the challenges while effectively using sprite interactions will be key to winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> a\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is located at (6, 6) and there are enemies nearby in rows 1 and 8. The goal is located at (8, 12), indicated by the '%' symbol. \n\nYour immediate aim should be to either avoid the enemies or defeat them while making your way toward the goal. Let's identify the best course of action.\n\n1. **Position Analysis**: \n   - The enemies at (1, 1) and (1, 11) are in row 1 and are positioned above the avatar. \n   - The moving area is mostly clear under row 6, with some boulders and crates on row 2 that might provide options for strategic blockades against the enemies.\n\n2. **Available Actions**:\n   - Moving UP (to (5, 6)) remains safe as there are still several empty spaces, and the enemies are far from your current row.\n   - Since there are enemies at (8, 3), (8, 4), and (8, 8), moving vertically upward will avoid direct confrontation. \n\nGiven the strategic objective to manage health and move toward the goal while keeping clear of enemies, moving **UP** would allow you to progress without immediate threats.\n\n### Plan\n- Move **UP** (to (5, 6)), which keeps you safe from enemies while you analyze the next move.\n\n```Action: 4```\n\nThis action is strategically sound since it avoids confrontation with enemies and positions the avatar for advantageous movement in the next turn.",
