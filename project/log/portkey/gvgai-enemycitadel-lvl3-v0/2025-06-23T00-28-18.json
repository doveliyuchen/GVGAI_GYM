    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's a comprehensive analysis of the game, including its genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fall within the **puzzle and platformer genre**. Players control an avatar in a 2D space, solving puzzles by manipulating objects to achieve specific goals while navigating hazards and enemies.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Movement and Collision**:\n   - The avatar can move and interact with various sprites.\n   - Certain objects (walls, holes, enemies) cause the avatar to bounce back if collided with.\n   - Objects (like crates and boulders) can affect the environment and each other.\n\n2. **Object Types**:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Walls, background, goal, and holes.\n   - **Passive Objects**: Crates and boulders, which can be manipulated by the avatar.\n   - **Moving Object**: The avatar, which has health points that can diminish upon interacting with enemies.\n\n3. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can be harmed by enemies, leading to a health point deduction.\n   - Crates can be used to cause damage or eliminate enemies by pushing them into specific holes or combinations with other objects.\n   - Successful interaction and combination of objects can lead to scoring points.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective appears to be to eliminate all enemies or reach the goal before losing all health points.\n- Points are earned by interacting with crates and holes, with special interactions yielding bonuses.\n- The game features strategic positioning of objects to clear paths and deal with enemies.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All goals must be collected/activated, achieving a count of zero remaining; reaching the goal sprite also provides significant scoring points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar's health points reaching zero leads to a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Monitor the avatar's health points carefully.\n   - Utilize crates and boulders to deal with enemies strategically to avoid health loss.\n\n2. **Spatial Awareness**:\n   - Analyze the level layout to plan movements and interactions, ensuring you do not trap the avatar or create an unwinnable situation.\n   - Use walls and holes tactically to funnel enemies toward traps.\n\n3. **Combining Objects**:\n   - Leverage crates and boulders effectively against enemies to maximize your score and eliminate threats.\n   - Try to create chain reactions with boulders and crates to interact with goals and enemy sprites efficiently.\n\n4. **Avoid Direct Combat**:\n   - Since enemies can reduce health, try to utilize the environment and object interactions rather than confronting them directly when possible.\n\n5. **Plan Movements**: \n   - Move carefully; consider each step and its potential interactions or consequences. Avoid backtracking into areas with enemies unless necessary.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, players can effectively navigate through levels, solve puzzles, maximize their score, and avoid health loss, ultimately leading to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> b\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> @\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> &\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> a\nrow=6, col=11 -> @\nrow=6, col=12 -> @\nrow=6, col=13 -> @\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> b\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game and the movement of the avatar, it is positioned at (row=6, col=10). In this state, the following observations can be made:\n\n- Surrounding the avatar are several '@' (boulders) to the left (col=11, 12, 13) and further in the layout.\n- There are enemies ('$') positioned to the left at (1,1), (2,1), (2,10), (2, 2) and holes ('&' and '*') in various positions below (row=3) and at (row=8, col=11).\n- The goal ('%') is located at (row=8, col=12).\n- The avatar has several options for movement but requires safety from collisions with enemies which could lead to a decrease in health.\n\nGiven this, the next logical action would be to move anywhere that allows us to navigate the enemies safely or acquire a strategy to eliminate threats.\n\nThe most effective first step is to move up (to (row=5, col=10)) since it keeps the avatar away from enemies while also allowing future movements towards the holes or crates for a strategic setup.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to keep the avatar safe and give a position closer to objects that could be helpful for managing enemies or moving toward goals.",
