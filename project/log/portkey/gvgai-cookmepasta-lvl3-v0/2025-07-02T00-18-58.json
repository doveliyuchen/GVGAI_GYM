    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle/platformer genre**. Players engage in a series of logical interactions involving items (like food ingredients) while navigating a spatial environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites such as an avatar (the chef), items like raw pasta, tomato, tuna, and immovable objects like walls and locks.\n- **Interactions**: Players can manipulate items by combining them in different ways, which results in transformations. There are both desirable outcomes (like making a completed dish) and undesirable ones (like creating incorrect combinations).\n- **Resource Management**: The key is a limited resource that players can collect and use to interact with locks.\n- **Score System**: Interactions can result in score changes, with positive scores awarded for successful dishes and negative scores for incorrect combinations.\n\n### Game Objective\nThe main objective is to create a complete dish (represented by the 'plateinplace' sprite) by strategically combining food items in the correct order. Players must navigate the environment to gather ingredients, handle the boiling water, and avoid making wrong combinations that lead to penalties.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game by creating the 'plateinplace' dish.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if they create one or more 'wrongplace' items, reaching the limit of 1, or if they are unable to progress due to mismanagement of items or failure to collect the necessary resources.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Collect Resources**: Start by moving the avatar to collect the key which will unlock necessary interactions. This should be a priority.\n  \n2. **Plan Combinations**: Carefully plan the combinations of ingredients:\n   - Combine raw pasta with boiling water to create 'pastainplace'.\n   - Combine tomato and tuna to create 'sauceinplace'.\n  \n3. **Avoid Wrong Combinations**: Be mindful of the interactions that lead to 'wrongplace'. Study which combinations lead to penalties and avoid them. \n\n4. **Order of Operations**: Follow a specific order to ensure that each action leads towards achieving the dish. For instance:\n   - First, ensure you have 'pastainplace' ready before attempting to finalize with 'sauceinplace'.\n  \n5. **Navigate Wisely**: Use the walls and placement properly to shield yourself from making mistakes. Plan the movements to avoid unnecessary backtracking or becoming stuck.\n\n6. **Sequence Execution**: Execute the cooking steps in the correct sequence to efficiently create your dish without hitting loss conditions.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can maximize their efficiency in acquiring needed resources and assembling the dish to achieve success in the game, all while minimizing the risk of failure.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> %\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, let\u2019s identify the position of the avatar and the surrounding elements. \n\n### Current Avatar Position\n- The avatar ('a') is located at (7, 7).\n\n### Surrounding Environment\n- There are various items around the avatar: \n  - To the left (7, 6) is a wall ('b').\n  - To the right (7, 8) is an empty floor ('.').\n  - Above (6, 7) is a wall ('b').\n  - Below (8, 7) is a wall ('b').\n\n### Key Observations\n- The only valid movement options for the avatar from its current position (7, 7) are to the right (7, 8) or to remain in place (ACTION_NIL), as the walls block movement in other directions.\n\n### Strategy Focus\nBased on the previously mentioned strategies:\n1. Moving to gather items is essential; however, there are no immediate ingredients to collect in the vicinity.\n2. Our next step should be moving one space right to (7, 8) to free up the area for future movements, as there is an empty space there.\n\n### Available Actions\n- The logical action at this moment is to **move right**.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will potentially position the avatar in a more favorable space for future moves and resource collection, staying aligned with the overall strategy of gathering resources while avoiding wrong combinations.",
