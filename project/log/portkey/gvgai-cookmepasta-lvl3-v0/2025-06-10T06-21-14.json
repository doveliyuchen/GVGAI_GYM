    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, it appears to be a puzzle game with cooking or restaurant-themed mechanics. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis:\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Puzzle/Strategy**: The game involves solving various challenges by arranging ingredients while adhering to specific interaction rules.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different sprites represent various entities in the game, including the avatar (the chef), ingredients (like raw pasta, tomato, tuna), and static elements (such as walls, locks, and the floor).\n- **Interactions**: The game features numerous interactions where combining different ingredients affects the game state (e.g., turning raw pasta into a dish, wrong combos decreasing score).\n- **Transformation**: Items can transform into new states depending on the avatar's actions and item combinations, which will affect the score positively or negatively.\n- **Resource Collection**: The avatar can collect items like keys to interact with locks.\n- **Score System**: Players gain or lose points based on their actions, which can affect the game's outcome.\n\n### Objective\n- The primary objective is to create the correct dish (a completed plate) by interacting with various ingredients and ensuring that they are placed in the right order and manner.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by creating at least one \u2018plateinplace\u2019 item, which reflects a successfully made dish.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if they create too many \u2018wrongplace\u2019 items, which signifies mistakes in the dish preparation.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with the interaction rules to know which combinations yield a successful result and which lead to penalties.\n  \n2. **Plan Resource Usage**: Collect the key as soon as possible to access the locked areas and ensure you are not stuck by the lock's restrictions.\n\n3. **Prioritize Correct Combinations**: Focus first on transforming raw pasta into 'pastainplace' using boiling water before working with sauces or additional ingredients. Recall that some combinations lead to penalties.\n\n4. **Minimize Wrong Combinations**: Keep track of potential wrong placements. Avoid combining certain items that are known to lead to \u2018wrongplace\u2019.\n\n5. **Test Different Paths**: Explore different ingredient placements through trial and error since some interactions might lead to unexpected successes.\n\n6. **Use Wall and Spacing Strategically**: Take advantage of the walls for positioning your avatar correctly. If you hit a lock and can't go forward, reassess your item collection strategy.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, players can navigate through the puzzles effectively and work towards creating finished dishes while avoiding mistakes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> %\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, let's first identify where the avatar ('a') is located. The avatar is currently at (7, 7). Notably, there are several interesting items and features around the avatar, including a key ('#') at (7, 5), a lock ('$') at (8, 10), and boiling water ('@') at (8, 3).\n\nAccording to our strategy, we want to prioritize the collection of useful resources. Since there's a key nearby, it would be a good idea to collect that first, as it may allow us to navigate through locked areas later. \n\nTo collect the key, the avatar can move left to (7, 6), and then left again to (7, 5).\n\nTherefore, I will first move left to (7, 6).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should position the avatar closer to the key, allowing for quick access to it on the next move.",
