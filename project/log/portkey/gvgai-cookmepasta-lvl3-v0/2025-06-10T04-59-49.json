Identify which ingredients must be combined and in what order.\n\n2. **Collect Necessary Resources:** Ensure to collect the key as it may unlock important areas and opportunities for gameplay progression.\n\n3. **Avoid Wrong Combinations:** Be cautious about the various interactions that can lead to wrong placements. Specifically, combining ingredients improperly can negatively impact your score and lead to a loss.\n\n4. **Use Boiling Water Wisely:** Interactions involving boiling water seem to be crucial for cooking pasta, so make sure it is paired correctly to maximize scoring.\n\n5. **Focus on Placing Ingredients Correctly:** Prioritize obtaining and placing the correct ingredients (pasta, sauce, tuna, tomato) in the correct sequence to create your dish\u2014a \"plate in place.\"\n\n6. **Watch the Walls:** The walls (and potential lock) seem to limit movement; avoid getting stuck or pushed back by completing actions inefficiently.\n\n7. **Experiment with Ingredients:** If possible, try out various combinations to recognize which interactions yield positive or negative outcomes before committing to a chain of actions.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can navigate through the puzzle mechanics, manage resources effectively, and aim towards winning by creating the desired dish while minimizing mistakes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> a\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> b\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> %\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

Nearby, you have various resources: a key ('#') at (7, 5) to your left, raw pasta ('%') down at (9, 7), and boiling water ('@') at (8, 3) below you.\n\nSince your position hasn't changed from the last state, I will analyze the situation carefully to determine a meaningful action. The immediate goal is to collect the necessary resources to eventually create a dish, which involves the proper combination of items:\n\n1. **Collecting the key** will definitely be advantageous since it may unlock further areas of the map.\n2. **Obtaining the raw pasta** is necessary because it is a key ingredient for creating a dish.\n3. **The boiling water** is also crucial for cooking the pasta.\n\nTo maximize my score and follow the provided strategy of focusing on collecting proper items, I should move to the left where the key ('#') is located.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left towards the key should help in progressing towards the win condition by allowing access to more gameplay opportunities.",
