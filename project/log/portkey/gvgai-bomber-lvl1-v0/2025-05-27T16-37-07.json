The player's avatar interacts with various objects (sprites) to reach a goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar that can interact with different types of sprites, such as walls, boxes, water, and fire.\n- **Interactions:** The avatar can step back when encountering walls or obstacles, can be killed by water, and interacts with fire, boxes, and bombs in various ways.\n- **Transformations:** Some sprites can transform into others based on interactions (e.g., water turning into mud when interacting with fire).\n- **Score & Health System:** The avatar has health points which can be subtracted by fire, and players can score points by destroying boxes with fire.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the 'goal' (a green door) while managing health and solving puzzles involving fire and other obstacles.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal with the avatar before a timeout occurs or before the avatar health reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the health points of the avatar drop to zero (due to interactions with fire or water) or if time runs out.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Identify safe paths and potential hazards (like fire or water).\n2. **Use Fire Wisely:** Fire can be used strategically to destroy boxes for points or manipulate other sprites. Be cautious though, as fire can also harm the avatar.\n3. **Manage Health:** Keep an eye on the avatar\u2019s health points. Avoid unnecessary encounters with fire or water, as they can lead to a quick loss.\n4. **Utilize Bombs Effectively:** Bombs can be used to interact with other sprites, causing them to transform or be destroyed. This can help clear paths or create advantageous situations.\n5. **Plan Moves Ahead:** Given the reactive nature of the game, always think a few steps ahead to avoid unintended consequences of sprite interactions.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of reaching the goal while successfully managing risks associated with different environments and interactions within the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcright lright -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlright -> '&'\nbomb -> '*'\nlright water -> 'l'\nbombm -> 'w'\nbomb bombm -> 'c'\nbombm water -> 'd'\nspark wall -> 's'\nspark water -> 'f'\nmud -> 'm'\nbox spark -> 'h'\nspark -> 'i'\nfireStart -> 'j'\nfireStart spark -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> &\nrow=2, col=8 -> l\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> l\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> #\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> @\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> m\nrow=4, col=6 -> m\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> m\nrow=6, col=7 -> m\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> m\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> @\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> @\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> m\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> @\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> m\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
