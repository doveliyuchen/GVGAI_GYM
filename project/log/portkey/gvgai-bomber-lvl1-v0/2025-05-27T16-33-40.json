Players maneuver through a level filled with obstacles while solving puzzles to advance toward a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - The game features various sprites, including immovable obstacles (walls, ground, water, mud) and interactive items (bombs, lasers, fire).\n   - Players control an avatar that can shoot bombs, which transform based on their interactions with other sprites (e.g., becoming \"bombm\").\n   - Different interactions dictate the results of player actions, like causing environmental changes (fire interacting with water turns it to mud) or leading to player damage (contact with fire reduces health).\n   \n2. **Objective**:\n   - The primary goal is to reach the goal sprite (green door) while navigating through hazardous environments.\n   - Players need to manipulate the environment using their bombs to create paths or eliminate obstacles.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - The game ends when either the avatar is defeated (health points reduce to zero), the goal is reached (green door is accessed), or a timeout occurs after a set period.\n   - The absence of the avatar sprite implies a loss, while the absence of the goal sprite implies a victory.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Players must balance their bomb usage strategically. Bombs can be used to eliminate obstacles but also risk creating hazards if misused. It's crucial to think ahead about where to deploy bombs.\n   \n2. **Exploration**:\n   - The level layout encourages exploration. Players should investigate areas thoroughly, as hidden pathways or fire sources may provide alternative routes or useful interactions.\n\n3. **Environmental Hazards**:\n   - Due to the presence of environmental risks like fire and water, players should be cautious about their movement and bomb placements to avoid health loss.\n   - Utilize fire to potentially clear obstacles while being mindful of its effects on other environmental sprites.\n\n4. **Timely Actions**:\n   - With a timeout condition in play, players need to move efficiently. Establishing a plan before executing actions can save time and avoid unnecessary deaths.\n   \n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Expect to face challenges as interactions can have unpredictable effects. Learning through trial and error can lead to a better understanding of how various sprites interact.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThis game requires a blend of strategic thinking and quick reflexes to navigate through the level effectively. By managing resources carefully, taking advantage of environmental interactions, exploring diligently, and acting within the time limit, players can successfully reach the goal and emerge victorious.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcright lright -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlright -> '&'\nlright water -> '*'\nbomb -> 'l'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> &\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> #\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> @\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> @\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> @\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> l\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> a\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> @\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

The goal sprite ('#') is at (2, 15). \n\nThe level layout primarily consists of walls ('%'), open spaces ('.'), and several bomb sprites ('l') and boxes ('@'). With the goal being to reach the green door while managing environmental hazards, I cannot move directly to the goal due to the walls and boxes blocking my path.\n\nConsidering the immediate surroundings, I see that directly right from my position (8, 7) is an empty space (8, 8), which allows for potential movement. However, the path to the green door is still a distance away and would require further exploration and potentially using bombs to clear any obstacles.\n\nAs my immediate action, I will move to the right to (8, 8) to continue my exploration.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should help in progressing towards the goal, as moving right opens up more possibilities for further exploration in forthcoming turns. I expect to reassess the next move based on what lies ahead in the newly accessed space.",
