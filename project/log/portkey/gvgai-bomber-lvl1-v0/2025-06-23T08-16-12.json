Players navigate through a grid-like environment filled with obstacles, enemies, and interactive sprites.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** Include ground, water, mud, walls, and boxes which the player interacts with but cannot move.\n   - **Lasers/Cannons:** Various laser types can be placed or activated to shoot in multiple directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - **Player Avatar:** The main character (avatar) has a defined health system that can be affected by interactions with fire or other hazardous elements.\n   - **Bombs and Fire Mechanics:** Bombs can create adverse effects when interacted with different sprites, transforming them or causing damage. Fire can interact with various sprites to either kill them or change their type.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, causing it to step back if it collides. \n   - Water is deadly for the avatar, leading to a game over if the player falls in.\n   - The goal (green door) becomes the finish line, and reaching it wins the game.\n   - Bombs can be transformed into a different state (bombm) that attracts gaze or becomes a spark upon certain interactions.\n   - Fire interacts with the environment in destructive ways, often affecting boxes and ultimately leading to score changes.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective is to navigate the level using the avatar, avoid hazards (like water and fire), and ultimately reach the goal while managing the resources and obstacles in the environment. Success is determined by reaching the goal without losing all health points or timing out.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - The game is won by reaching the goal (the green door).\n  - There is a time limit of 1000 units; if the time runs out, the player loses.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The player loses if the avatar's health points reach zero.\n  - Falling into water results instantly in a loss.\n  \n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan the Route:** Study the level layout before moving to identify the best path to the goal. Avoid areas with fire or water to preserve health.\n\n2. **Use Bombs Wisely:** Bombs transform into different states (bombm), which can attract gaze. These should be used strategically to either create space or affect other sprites positively.\n\n3. **Fire Management:** Be cautious around fire. If necessary, use fire as a tool to destroy boxes and generate sparks, which may open new pathways or create helpful interactions. \n\n4. **Health Preservation:** Always keep track of health points. Prioritize avoiding fire and ensuring you don\u2019t accidentally collide with dangerous sprites.\n\n5. **Timed Play:** Since there is a time limit, plan your moves quickly but carefully, ensuring that you do not rush into danger. \n\nOverall, understanding the strategic implications of each sprite will guide players to make informed decisions as they navigate the challenges posed by the game\u2019s environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcright lright -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlright -> '&'\nlright water -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> &\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> #\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> @\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> a\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> @\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> @\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> @\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
