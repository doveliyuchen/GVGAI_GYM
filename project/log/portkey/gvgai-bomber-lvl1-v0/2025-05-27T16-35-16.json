Players control an avatar in a grid-based environment, navigating obstacles, enemies, and various interactive elements.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Movement & Interaction:** Players control an avatar that can move around a grid. The avatar can interact with different sprites (objects) in the environment in various ways, including stepping back from obstacles, transforming or destroying objects, and avoiding hazards like water and fire.\n   \n2. **Sprite Types:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include wall, ground, water, mud, and fire; players cannot pass through these and must navigate around them.\n   - **Transformable Sprites:** Elements like bombs and fire can change forms based on interactions (e.g., a bomb can become a spark when interacting with other elements).\n   - **Goals and Hazards:** The objective is to reach the goal (the green door), while also managing hazards like fire and water that can harm the avatar.\n\n3. **Health & Scoring:** The avatar starts with 10 health points and can lose health when interacting with fire. Scoring is influenced by interactions with specific sprites (e.g., box and fire).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the 'goal' sprite (the door) while navigating challenges and managing the avatar's health. Players must avoid fatal interactions (like water) that will kill the avatar before achieving their goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Players win if they reach the goal (door):\n  - Condition: `SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0 win=True`\n- Players lose if they run out of health (the avatar is killed):\n  - Condition: `SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`\n- Players can also lose if the time runs out, represented by a timeout mechanism:\n  - Condition: `Timeout limit=1000 win=False`\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Exploration:** Begin by exploring the environment to understand the layout and the locations of hazards and resources (like bombs and fire).\n   \n2. **Resource Management:** Utilize bombs wisely to interact with other sprites, particularly to clear pathways or activate mechanisms that can help get to the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Carefully navigate around fire and water, which can harm the avatar or create obstacles like mud. Look for ways to manipulate other sprites to avoid these hazards.\n\n4. **Strategic Interactions:** Use the bomb to destroy or transform interactive elements strategically. For example:\n   - Use bombs near fire to create sparks or clear objects like boxes.\n   - Avoid using bombs near water to prevent immediate loss.\n  \n5. **Health Preservation:** Maintain careful movement to avoid interactions that could lead to health loss. Always have a clear exit from hazardous areas and preserve health points by taking safer routes.\n\n6. **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the time limit. Move efficiently towards the goal while utilizing bombs and other items effectively.\n\nBy following this strategy and understanding the game's mechanics, players can maximize their chances of reaching the goal and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcright lright -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlright -> '&'\nbomb wall -> '*'\nlright water -> 'l'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> &\nrow=2, col=2 -> &\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> &\nrow=2, col=5 -> &\nrow=2, col=6 -> &\nrow=2, col=7 -> &\nrow=2, col=8 -> l\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> l\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> &\nrow=2, col=13 -> &\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> #\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> %\nrow=3, col=2 -> %\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> %\nrow=3, col=6 -> %\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> @\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> @\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> a\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> @\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> @\nrow=7, col=16 -> @\nrow=7, col=17 -> @\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> @\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> @\nrow=9, col=12 -> @\nrow=9, col=13 -> @\nrow=9, col=14 -> @\nrow=9, col=15 -> @\nrow=9, col=16 -> @\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> *\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",
