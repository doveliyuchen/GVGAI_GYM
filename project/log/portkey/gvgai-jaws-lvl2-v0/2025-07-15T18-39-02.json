The player controls an avatar (a submarine), interacting with various marine creatures and resources within a limited environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Movement and Shooting**: The player controls a submarine (avatar) that can shoot torpedoes to interact with fish and threats.\n- **Resource Collection**: The primary objectives include collecting resources (shells and shark fangs) by either defeating adversarial creatures (shark, whale, piranha) or converting certain interactions into resources.\n- **Ecosystem Interaction**: Players can spawn new resources or creatures based on their interactions and current resource levels.\n- **Cooldown and Probability Mechanics**: Certain enemies (whales and piranhas) have cooldowns, which limit how often they can engage with the player, while sharks have a low spawn probability, representing varying difficulty levels.\n\n### Objectives\n- The player aims to **collect resources** (shells and shark fangs) while avoiding or defeating threats (sharks, whales, and piranhas).\n- The ultimate goal is to survive for a specified duration of **1000 time units** or until the player loses all avatars (with player loss leading to immediate termination).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Survive for the duration of 1000 time units or until resources run out.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the \"SpriteCounter\" for the avatar reaches zero, indicating all avatars are defeated or lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy Recommendations\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting shells and shark fangs efficiently without allowing the shark to overpower the avatar (keep the shell count high).\n2. **Positioning**: Stay at a safe distance from the sharks while maximizing your ability to shoot down fish or approach resources. Utilize range effectively to prevent ambushes.\n3. **Target Prioritization**: Identifying which creatures (whales, piranhas, fish) yield higher point resources or are necessary to create advantageous situations (like spawning shark fangs if needed).\n4. **Cooldown Awareness**: Be mindful of the cooldowns for whales and piranhas; time your interactions with them carefully to ensure you don\u2019t encounter them unexpectedly while engaged with another enemy.\n5. **Avoid Overcommitment**: Do not engage in fights unless necessary to conserve resources; retreat if the odds are unfavorable (my avatar has less than 15 shells when facing a shark).\n6. **Adaptation**: Adapt your strategies as needed; the environment may require changing approaches based on the spawning and behavior of the enemies.\n\nBy employing these strategies, a player can effectively navigate through the game, optimize resource acquisition, and increase the chances of survival against the adversaries present in the water.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater piranhahole -> '1'\nwater whalehole -> '2'\nwater sharkhole -> '3'\nwater -> '.'\npiranhahole water -> '@'\nsharkhole water -> '#'\nwater whale whalehole -> '$'\nwater whale -> '%'\nshark water -> '&'\npiranha piranhahole water -> '*'\npiranha water -> 'p'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> .\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> .\nrow=0, col=10 -> .\nrow=0, col=11 -> .\nrow=0, col=12 -> .\nrow=0, col=13 -> .\nrow=0, col=14 -> .\nrow=0, col=15 -> .\nrow=0, col=16 -> .\nrow=0, col=17 -> .\nrow=0, col=18 -> .\nrow=0, col=19 -> .\nrow=0, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=0 -> .\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=2, col=0 -> .\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> .\nrow=2, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=0 -> .\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=4, col=0 -> .\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> .\nrow=4, col=20 -> @\nrow=5, col=0 -> 2\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> %\nrow=5, col=11 -> %\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> p\nrow=6, col=17 -> p\nrow=6, col=18 -> p\nrow=6, col=19 -> .\nrow=6, col=20 -> @\nrow=7, col=0 -> 2\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> %\nrow=7, col=5 -> %\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> .\nrow=7, col=20 -> .\nrow=8, col=0 -> a\nrow=8, col=1 -> &\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> .\nrow=8, col=19 -> .\nrow=8, col=20 -> .",

According to the game mechanics, engaging with the shark is dangerous, so the immediate objective should be to move away from it to maintain safety while collecting resources.\n\n### Plan of Action\nTo reposition my submarine and avoid confrontation with the shark, I will take action by moving LEFT (though in the context of the map, I cannot as it is the edge), or moving UP since there are no valid moves to the left. However, I will first attempt to move UP to explore the upper area for more resources or potential safety.\n\nLet's execute the action:\n``` Action:4 ```\nBy moving UP, I expect to safely distance myself from the shark and potentially explore more of the map for resource collection.",
