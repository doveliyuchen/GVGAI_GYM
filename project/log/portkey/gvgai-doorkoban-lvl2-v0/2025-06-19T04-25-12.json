It involves player movement, interaction with various objects (sprites), and solving puzzles to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites have distinct functions:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move and interact with objects.\n   - **Boxes**: Passive objects that can be moved but may have specific interactions with the avatar and other sprites.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers that restrict movement.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous areas that lead to loss.\n   - **Doors**: Can be interacted with, potentially changing state (open or closed).\n   - **Exit**: The goal; interacting with it ends the level and awards points.\n\n2. **Interactions**: Several predefined interactions dictate how sprites behave when combined in various ways:\n   - Bouncing off walls or boxes.\n   - Killing specific sprites (like boxes or the avatar) when conditions are met (e.g., box placed in a hole).\n   - Score changes based on actions (placing boxes in holes nets increasing score).\n\n3. **Sprite Counter**: A mechanism that tracks specific conditions related to the exit. If the count reaches zero, the player wins. Otherwise, timeout conditions can lead to failure.\n\n### Objectives\n- The main objective is to manipulate boxes to solve puzzles and interact with the exit sprite, which provides the highest score and ends the level.\n- Players must manage the positions of boxes and ensure proper interactions occur to unlock the exit.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the level by reaching the \"exit\" and ensuring all conditions related to the exit sprite are fulfilled (sprite counter reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the timeout limit (1000) is reached before meeting the win condition.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before starting your interactions, analyze the layout. Identify where each box needs to go to interact with holes for maximum score while also ensuring they ultimately help you access the exit.\n\n2. **Prioritize Box Interactions**: Focus on placing boxes into holes to score efficiently. Pay attention to how many points each hole provides (box0: 1 point, box1: 2 points, etc.) and prioritize based on the highest point yield.\n\n3. **Avoid Dangerous Areas**: Be mindful of holes since they will eliminate both the box and avatar. Move carefully to prevent falling into these areas.\n\n4. **Utilize Walls**: Use walls strategically to bounce the avatar back and forth to position boxes better without losing them.\n\n5. **Identify Exit Route**: Work your way towards the exit actively\u2014while fighting against the timer\u2014ensuring you have planned your box placements so that they do not block your path to the exit.\n\n6. **Watch the Timer**: Keep an eye on the remaining time. Make moves efficiently and quickly to avoid a loss due to the timeout condition.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can maximize your chances of completing the level successfully while scoring as high as possible.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> c\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> f\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> w\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> #\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> a\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> w\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

    "content": "To determine the next action, we need to assess the current state of the game given the layout:\n\n- The avatar (represented as 'a') is located at (10, 8).\n- The exit (represented as 'e') is at (10, 1).\n- There is a box (represented as '#') located at (9, 8).\n- There are holes, walls, and other interactive elements scattered throughout the map.\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. The exit is far from the avatar's current position, and there is a box directly above the avatar that may need to be moved.\n2. There are walls which restrict movement to certain directions.\n3. The player needs to consider moving the box to potentially clear a path.\n\n### Strategy Implications:\n- The players need to get to the exit at (10, 1) while interacting with the box at (9, 8).\n- Moving down may not yield any immediate benefits, as it would not bring the player closer to the exit.\n- Moving left (to (10, 7)) would be a more strategic choice as it rotates the avatar towards the box.\n\n### Action Selection:\nGiven that the position does not change with the last action, the expected meaningful action here is likely to rotate and attempt another left movement.\n\nThus, I propose: \n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action aims to reposition towards the box while keeping in mind the strategy of approaching the exit effectively. With this action, I expect the avatar to move closer to the box next turn, gearing up for further interactions.",
