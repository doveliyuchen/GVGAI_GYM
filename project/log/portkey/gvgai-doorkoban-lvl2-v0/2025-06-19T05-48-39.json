Players need to think critically about how to move and interact with different game elements (sprites) in order to reach an objective.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game features several types of sprites, including walls, holes, doors, a moving avatar, and boxes. The avatar can move and interact with other sprites.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move forwards and bounce off boxes, while walls are immovable and act as barriers.\n- **Interactions**: The game mechanics are defined by specific interactions:\n  - The avatar cannot pass through walls or doors without certain conditions being met.\n  - Boxes can be used to interact with holes to score points.\n  - The exit can be reached and scores points when the avatar interacts with it.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective appears to be to **reach the exit** (the open door), while collecting points through interactions with holes and boxes. Points are scored based on which hole the box is placed into.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: You win by making the exit sprite count reach zero (indicating the exit has been reached by the avatar). \n- **Loss Condition**: The game has a timeout of 1000 units of time, after which the player loses if they have not reached the exit.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since walls block the avatar, analyze the layout of the level to determine optimal paths. Look for opportunities to move boxes to the holes to score points.\n   \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Each box corresponds to a hole that grants increasing points. Strategically use boxes to maximize your score while also keeping in mind the limited number of moves.\n\n3. **Avoid Unnecessary Moves**: Given the timeout mechanic, be efficient in your movements. Avoid bouncing against walls and other obstacles unnecessarily, which could waste time.\n\n4. **Prioritize the Exit**: Your end goal is the exit. As you score points, keep the path to the exit clear and prioritize reaching it as soon as possible.\n\n5. **Experiment with Interactions**: Test different combinations of box placements and movements to see how they affect your ability to score points and reach the exit. This might also help you discover unforeseen moves that could assist in efficiently solving the puzzle.\n\n6. **Watch for Patterns**: As you play through different levels, observe patterns in how boxes can be useful for scoring and for blocking or opening access to the exit.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can work towards maximizing their score while efficiently reaching the exit, crucially balancing puzzle-solving with time management.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> c\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> f\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> w\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> #\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> a\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> w\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",
