Players navigate through a series of obstacles, interact with various elements, and must think critically to progress.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Static elements that form the base of the level layout.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can move around the game space.\n   - **Boxes**: Passive objects that can be interacted with to achieve various effects.\n   - **Holes**: Obstacles that the boxes can be pushed into, with different interactions.\n   - **Doors**: Serve as entry and exit points; closed doors need to be interacted with or activated.\n   - **Walls**: Immoveable barriers that block the player's path.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes or step back when hitting walls and doors.\n   - Boxes can slide into holes, leading to the \"death\" of the box and potentially affecting the level state.\n   - The unique interactions with holes yield score changes, suggesting a scoring system based on puzzle solving.\n   - The exit allows for completing the level, granting a score based on interaction with it.\n\n**Objectives**:\n- Main goal: To guide the avatar to the exit door while effectively using boxes to manipulate the environment.\n- Secondary objectives: Maximizing score by strategically using the boxes to interact with the holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the exit sprite is reached, and there are no exit sprites left (SpriteCounter limit = 0). \n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the time limit of 1000 units is reached without reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Start by understanding the layout of walls, boxes, and holes. Identify box positions and nearby holes for potential interactions that lead towards clearing the exit.\n\n2. **Plan Box Movements**: Focus on how you can use boxes to interact with their corresponding holes (box0 to hole0, etc.). Each hole gives a different score based on which box is used. Strategizing the order of placing boxes can help maximize your score.\n\n3. **Use Time Wisely**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Make decisions quickly, but ensure each move is calculated. Avoid unnecessary movements that don\u2019t lead towards the exit.\n\n4. **Utilize Walls and Doors**: Since close walls can redirect movement, look for ways to position the avatar to bounce boxes effectively. Ensure the boxes are in the optimal position to create paths to the holes.\n\n5. **Exit Strategy**: Once the boxes have been manipulated to achieve scores and clear necessary holes, direct the avatar towards the exit door. \n\n6. **Minimize Backtracking**: Since interactions can cause 'undoAll' effects or 'killBoth', plan paths that minimize backtracking or reliance on redoing actions unless necessary.\n\nBy combining exploration with strategic box manipulation and effective time management, players can navigate the puzzle efficiently, aiming for both the exit and high scores.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole0 -> '0'\nfloor hole1 -> '1'\nfloor hole2 -> '2'\nfloor hole3 -> '3'\nbox0 floor -> '*'\nbox1 floor -> '+'\nbox2 floor -> '-'\nbox3 floor -> '/'\ndoor1 floor -> 'b'\ndoor2 floor -> 'c'\ndoor3 floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nwall -> 'w'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nbox0 -> '@'\nbox1 -> '#'\nbox2 -> '$'\nbox3 -> '%'\ndoor0 -> '&'\ndoor1 -> '*'\ndoor2 -> 'b'\ndoor3 -> 'd'\nexit -> 'e'\nhole0 -> 'h'\nhole1 -> 'w'\nhole2 -> 'c'\nhole3 -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> c\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> &\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> h\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> a\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> f\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> &\nrow=8, col=13 -> w\nrow=8, col=14 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> e\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> d\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> #\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> .\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> w\nrow=10, col=14 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> .\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> .\nrow=11, col=14 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=13 -> w\nrow=12, col=14 -> w",

Therefore, this movement is valid.\n- Moving **RIGHT** would take me to (6, 11), which is also a floor space ('.').\n- Moving **UP** to (5, 10) would land me on a hole ('h'), where I might interact with the box positioned at (5, 13) if I chose to go that route later.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (7, 10) would land me on a floor space ('.').\n\nGiven the objective to get closer to the exit located at row 10, I will select the action **DOWN** to move towards row 7, column 10, as it keeps me navigating downwards toward the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will help me explore more of the level toward the exit, and I expect to move forward without backtracking while maintaining progress in the correct direction.",
