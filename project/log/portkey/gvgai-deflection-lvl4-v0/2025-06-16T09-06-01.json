    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here's an analysis:\n\n### Game Genre:\nBased on the mechanics, the game appears to fall under the **action-adventure** genre with a focus on exploration and survival. The presence of health points and interactions with various entities suggests a need for strategic movement and resource management.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites:\n    - **Avatar**: The player's character with health points that can be influenced by interactions with other sprites.\n    - **Immovable Objects**: Backgrounds, nebulae, planets, and atmospheres that provide the setting, hazards, or objectives.\n    - **Dynamic Objects**: Turrets and bombs that interact with the avatar in specific ways.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The avatar can engage with multiple sprites, leading to health points being added or subtracted, transformations, or triggering other effects:\n    - **Health Management**: Collecting energy from planets can restore health, while colliding with bombs or the nebulae causes damage.\n    - **Transformation**: Interacting with empty planets transforms them into busy planets, impacting tactical options.\n    - **Killing Hazards**: The black hole acts as both a hazard (kills the avatar) and a potential score increaser if the avatar interacts with it.\n\n3. **Movement and Speed**: The avatar moves at a speed of 0.5, which suggests careful navigation is important to avoid hazards, especially with the inactive yet potentially dangerous environment (bombs and blackholes).\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objectives of the game include:\n- Maintain your avatar's health while navigating the map.\n- Transform empty planets to busy ones to potentially enhance your score.\n- Avoid death by managing interactions with detrimental sprites like nebulae, bombs, and black holes.\n- Achieve a win condition by eliminating all black holes within a time limit.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The player wins by reaching a limit of 0 for black holes (destroying all).\n- **Loss**: The player loses if their avatar is destroyed (health points reach 0) or if time runs out (timeout limit of 1000).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\nTo excel in this game, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Health Management**: Prioritize collecting health from planets and avoid interactions with bombs and nebulae. Ensure you\u2019re constantly aware of your health points.\n\n2. **Movement**: Use a strategic approach to navigate around the sprites. Plan routes that allow for timely visits to empty planets while avoiding turrets and bombs.\n\n3. **Transformations**: Focus on transforming empty planets into busy ones to gain potential resources or score benefits. This can create safe havens to retreat to.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk versus reward of engaging with the black holes. If they can provide score increases, consider using them strategically when you have spare health.\n\n5. **Timing**: Be conscious of the game timer. Ensure that your actions are timely, particularly when interacting with the atmosphere for potential transformations.\n\nBy integrating these strategies while remaining adaptable to the changing game environment, players will position themselves well to avoid loss conditions and strive for victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
