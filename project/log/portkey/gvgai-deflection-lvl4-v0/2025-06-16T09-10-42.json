Players must navigate a scrolling environment filled with obstacles and enemies while maintaining health and completing objectives.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Avatar Movement & Health:**\n   - The avatar can move at a speed of 0.5 and has health points (HP) ranging from 0 to 20. Players can regain health by interacting with certain sprites.\n\n2. **Environmental Interactions:**\n   - Collision with specific sprites (e.g., \"nebula\") will decrease health. \n   - The avatar can be killed by the \"bomb\" and \"blackhole\" sprites, which require careful navigation and avoidance.\n\n3. **Resource Transformation:**\n   - The avatar can transform \"emptyPlanets\" into \"busyPlanets,\" which likely serve as a resource or safe point.\n   \n4. **Timer Mechanic:**\n   - Interaction with the \"atmosphere\" adds a timer that influences transformations from busy to empty planets, indicating resource management over time.\n\n5. **Enemy Engagement:**\n   - The turret sprite actively bombards the avatar, adding another layer of challenge, as they can randomly attack every three seconds.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to survive while managing health points, interacting with planets, and ultimately avoiding death from environmental hazards. The player wins by ensuring that the blackhole sprite is eliminated before the avatar's health reaches zero.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Win if the \"blackhole\" sprite count reaches zero.\n- Lose if the avatar sprite count reaches zero, or after a timeout of 1000 units of time.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Stay Mobile:** Move constantly to avoid turrets and bombs that can kill the avatar. Use the avatar\u2019s relatively slow speed wisely.\n\n2. **Manage Health Wisely:** Prioritize interactions with planets to regain health. Avoid the nebula and bomb sprites to minimize health loss.\n\n3. **Planet Strategy:** Regularly interact with empty planets to convert them to busy planets. This could provide safe havens or additional health regeneration when necessary.\n\n4. **Plan Timing of Interactions:** Since the atmosphere adds a timer, it may be wise to time interactions so that busy planets can be transformed into empty planets at crucial moments to extend survival.\n\n5. **Monitor the Blackhole:** Prioritize finding and eliminating the \"blackhole\" sprite, as this is your win condition. Keep track of its location and make it a target when it is safe to do so.\n\n6. **Avoid Risks:** Steer clear of situations where you may have multiple threats (e.g., turrets and bombs) in close proximity, as it\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed.\n\n7. **Use Environmental Awareness:** Maintain a strong awareness of the game environment and enemy locations to prevent getting trapped or cornered.\n\nBy executing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of survival and success in eliminating threats while managing their avatar's health effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
