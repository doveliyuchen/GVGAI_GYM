    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**\nThe game appears to belong to the **arcade-style action** genre, with elements of resource management and strategy. Players control a spacecraft (the avatar) and navigate through a grid filled with various sprites, including enemies (bombs and turrets) and resources (planets).\n\n**Mechanics**\n- **Movement**: The avatar moves at a slow speed (0.5), indicating a deliberate pace in gameplay.\n- **Health Points (HP)**: The avatar has a maximum of 20 HP and a current health of 15. Interacting with specific sprites can either decrease or increase these health points.\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar loses HP when interacting with a nebula or a bomb.\n  - The avatar can increase HP by visiting a planet.\n  - The avatar can transform empty planets into busy planets, possibly signifying resource gathering or territory control.\n  - Avoiding blackholes is critical, as they result in instant loss of the avatar.\n- **Scoring**: Engaging with blackholes provides score changes, indicating that playing strategically can lead to points through certain actions.\n\n**Objectives**\n- The primary objective for the player is to survive while managing health points, interacting with planets, and avoiding the dangers posed by bombs and blackholes.\n- The player must also *eliminate* blackholes, as indicated by the win condition of having their sprite counter limited to zero for blackholes.\n  \n**Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Conditions**: The player wins if the number of blackholes is reduced to zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed (sprite counter limited to zero for the avatar) or if a timer runs out.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n1. **Avoid Enemies**: Prioritize avoiding bombs and turrets to preserve health. Stay alert to navigate away from hazardous areas.\n2. **Manage Health**: Regularly seek out planets to regain health points, especially after taking damage. Balancing your HP is crucial for survival.\n3. **Transform Planets**: Convert empty planets into busy ones to possibly unlock resources or aid in gameplay. This can provide advantages later on.\n4. **Utilize Nebulae Strategically**: While they cause damage, understanding their placement might play into tactical retreats or creating advantageous positions.\n5. **Avoid Blackholes**: Always steer clear of blackholes as they lead to immediate loss. Keeping track of their locations on the map will help in planning movements.\n6. **Resource Planning**: Since the game is time-limited, efficiently managing time and sprite interactions will be key to achieving the primary objective of eliminating blackholes.\n\nIn summary, success in this game will depend on careful navigation, strategic interaction with sprites, effective health management, and quick reflexes to avoid deadly traps and enemies. Balancing offense and defense while remaining aware of the game\u2019s objectives will lead to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To proceed effectively, I need to assess the current state of the game and define my position relative to the various dangers (like bombs and blackholes) as well as potential health resources (like planets). I\u2019ll reflect on previous actions taken and ensure my position has changed before determining the next appropriate action.\n\nSince the position hasn't been specified, I'll assume the avatar has not moved yet. \n\n1. If I previously attempted to move towards an enemy or a blackhole without any resultant movement, I'll need to try a different direction beneficial for survival.\n2. If I am close to a healthy planet, my goal should be to navigate towards it for HP recovery.\n\nGiven that I must maintain health while avoiding dangers, I\u2019ll analyze the most strategic direction based on available resources and threats.\n\nAssuming I noticed a health-giving planet available; I can move towards it. If I haven't changed position yet, I will choose to move in that direction.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to move towards the right where I assume there\u2019s a planet while avoiding potential dangers. I expect this aligns with my strategy to regain health and avoid enemies.",
