    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules and layout provided, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game falls into the category of a **2D Action/Survival Game**. Players navigate a space environment, utilizing strategic movement and interactions with various sprites while facing potential hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Player Sprite (Avatar)**:\n   - The avatar can move at a speed of 0.5 and has health points.\n   - Interacts with several objects (nebula, bombs, planets) that can help or harm.\n\n2. **Environment Sprites**:\n   - **Nebula**: Reduces avatar health.\n   - **Bombs**: Can cause damage or attract the avatar's attention.\n   - **Planets (Empty and Busy)**: Empty planets can be transformed into busy planets upon interaction, which might indicate resource collection or strategic options.\n   - **Turrets**: These randomly drop bombs, adding an element of risk to navigating around them.\n   - **Black Hole**: Acts as a passive threat that leads to instant player death, but can also provide a score increase.\n\n3. **Health and Scoring**:\n   - The player starts with a limited health pool and can gain or lose health through various interactions.\n   - Scoring is impacted by both interactions and survival.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is to survive as long as possible while interacting with the environment. The game can end in multiple ways:\n- If the avatar's health reaches zero, resulting in death and game loss.\n- If the player interacts successfully with the black hole, leading to an increase in score.\n- The game also has a timeout condition that leads to loss if the player doesn't achieve the objective within a given time limit.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- Win: The player wins if the sprite counter for black holes reaches zero.\n- Loss: The player loses if the avatar\u2019s sprite counter reaches zero (the avatar is killed) or if the timeout of 1000 is reached without fulfilling win conditions.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: \n   - Steer clear of nebulae and bombs that can quickly deplete health. Monitor turret positions and move through space carefully to avoid bomb projectiles.\n\n2. **Planeteering**: \n   - Interact with empty planets to convert them into busy planets, possibly for gaining health. This interaction might provide strategic advantages while maintaining health.\n\n3. **Health Management**:\n   - Use planets for health restoration; ensure health points do not fall below a critical level to prevent sudden loss.\n\n4. **Utilize the Black Hole**:\n   - Although dangerous, finding safe opportunities to interact with the black hole may yield score benefits and contribute to strategic play.\n\n5. **Timer Awareness**:\n   - Be mindful of the timeout condition. Balance exploration to gather resources/health with the urgency to overcome hazards efficiently.\n\nIn summary, the game requires players to maintain a delicate balance between exploring for resources, managing health and hazards, and aiming for the completion of objectives, all while navigating a potentially hostile environment filled with risks and rewards. Understanding the layout and sprite behaviors will be key in maximizing survival and achieving a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To effectively proceed with the game, I need to assess the state of my avatar and surrounding environment, keeping in mind the position and potential hazards. Based on the provided strategies:\n\n1. **Avoid hazards** such as nebulae and bombs to maintain health.\n2. **Interact with empty planets** to convert them into busy planets for possible health gain or resources.\n3. **Use the black hole** carefully for score benefits, but ensure I have safe opportunities to do so.\n4. **Monitor the timer** diligently to avoid running out of time without achieving win conditions.\n\nI will start by reviewing the current position of my avatar and identify any nearby hazards or useful objects (like empty planets to convert).\n\nOnce I understand the current state, I'll decide on the most effective action to take, ensuring I'm considering my position and the surrounding environment carefully. \n\nIf my avatar position hasn't changed, I will need to opt for a different strategy based on the surrounding environment.\n\nGiven that I don't have a specific current state described, I will assume that I need to evaluate from my last known position.\n\nIf the position is unchanged (indicating a rotation may have occurred), I will attempt to move in the direction I aimed for initially. If there were hazardous objects or an unconverted empty planet nearby, I might need to reconsider my approach.\n\nGiven a lack of specifics, I will select an action that I predict will move me without hazard threat, leaning toward interaction:\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis implies moving left towards potential resources. The expectation is to encounter an empty planet or navigate safely away from hazards, adhering to the strategy of avoiding threats and seeking resources.",
