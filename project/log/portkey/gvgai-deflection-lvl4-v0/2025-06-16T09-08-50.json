It combines combat mechanics with exploration and survival elements.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various entities are present in the game:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's spacecraft, capable of moving and interacting with other sprites.\n   - **Nebula**: A hindrance that causes health loss when encountered.\n   - **Bomb**: A dangerous object that can kill the player or attract their attention.\n   - **Turrets**: Static defensive mechanisms shooting bombs.\n   - **Planets**: Representing health resources and potential for transformation.\n   - **Blackhole**: A lethal entity that can eliminate the avatar.\n   - **Atmosphere**: Provides a temporary boost or transformation power.\n\n2. **Player Interaction With Sprites**:\n   - The avatar can lose health from the nebula, bombs, and blackholes.\n   - Interaction with empty planets allows transformation into busy planets, which likely indicates resource collection.\n   - Interacting with certain sprites (like atmosphere) enables time management for transforming planets.\n\n3. **Movement and Speed**: The avatar has a relatively slow speed (0.5), implying strategic movement rather than fast-paced dodging.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary aim is to survive while managing health points and transforming planets to busy states for potentially gaining advantages (though the exact benefit from busy planets isn't specified).\n- You must avoid or mitigate damage from enemy sprites, mainly bombs and blackholes, while navigating through the level which may contain strategic terrain (such as turrets).\n- To win, ensure that all blackhole sprites are eliminated while keeping at least one avatar sprite alive.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- Win Condition: You win by eliminating all available blackholes.\n- Loss Condition: If the avatar's sprite count drops to zero, you lose. You also lose if the game times out after 1000 units of time.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**: Prioritize health restoration by interacting with planets, but be cautious of immediate threats (bombs and turrets).\n2. **Plan Your Path**: Given the presence of turrets and other danger zones, scout ahead to gauge safe routes and avoid areas with a high density of deadly sprites.\n3. **Prioritize Targets**: Focus on engaging with blackholes and turrets but do so when you have ensured your safety and collected necessary health from planets.\n4. **Utilize Atmospheres Smartly**: Make strategic decisions on when to transform planets and use the temporary timer wisely to achieve maximum efficiency.\n5. **Avoiding Bombs**: Actively try to navigate around areas where bombs are likely to spawn and be proactive in engaging or avoiding them.\n6. **Time Management**: Monitor your progress against the time limit and ensure you\u2019re making effective moves to eliminate blackholes before time expires.\n\nBy focusing on survival through health management, strategically engaging enemies, and effectively using the environment to your advantage, you can successfully navigate through the game\u2019s challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

This will help me make a meaningful decision. \n\nGiven that movement is strategic and necessary for success in this game, I will begin by attempting to move in one direction to gather information about the layout while avoiding immediate threats. Let's start by moving left to see if there are any resources or threats in that direction. \n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nI expect this action to allow me to potentially discover more about my surroundings, ideally providing me with advantageous resources or identifying threats to avoid as I continue to plan my strategy.",
