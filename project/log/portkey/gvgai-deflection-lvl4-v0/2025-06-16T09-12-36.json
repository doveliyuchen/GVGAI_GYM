    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a 2D action-adventure game, possibly with survival elements, where the player navigates an environment filled with hazards and opportunities for recovery or transformation.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites and Interaction:** Players control an avatar that interacts with various sprites (game objects) including turrets, bombs, planets, and a blackhole. Key interactions include:\n  - Taking damage from nebulae and bombs.\n  - Gaining health points from planets.\n  - Transforming empty planets into busy planets upon landing on them.\n  - The threat of being killed by bombs or the blackhole.\n  \n- **Health System:** The avatar has a limited number of health points (HP), which can be affected by environmental hazards (subtracting HP) or by interacting with planets (adding HP).\n\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar appears to have a slow movement speed (0.5), making navigation strategic, as avoiding hazards and finding safe places requires careful movement.\n\n- **Timers and Transformations:** The atmosphere sprite introduces time-based mechanics, allowing transformations between busy and empty planets after a set interval.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The player's primary objective is to survive while avoiding health loss and to ultimately manage the collection and transformation of planets, while dealing with threats posed by turrets and debris.\n- A secondary objective is likely to progress towards defeating the blackhole, as interacting with it grants a score while killing the avatar ends the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the count of the 'blackhole' sprite reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite count reaches zero or if a time limit of 1000 is reached without achieving the win condition.\n\n### Suggested Strategies\n1. **Prioritize Health Management:**\n   - Keep a close eye on your health points and utilize planet sprites to regain health whenever possible.\n   - Avoid unnecessary encounters with hazards to preserve health.\n\n2. **Navigation Tactics:**\n   - Move strategically and slowly navigate to avoid turret fire and bomb proximity to prevent losing health.\n   - Use the environment to find safe routes and interact with planets efficiently.\n\n3. **Turret Awareness:**\n   - Learn the patterns of turret placements and aim to avoid them. If necessary, lure bombs towards them to eliminate threats.\n\n4. **Planetary Management:**\n   - Engage with empty planets to transform them into busy planets, potentially converting them into health sources. This will provide a critical resource for healing over time.\n\n5. **Time Management with Atmosphere:**\n   - Take advantage of the atmospheric sprite's timer to convert busy planets back to empty ones, which might help in managing the avatar's health over time.\n   - Monitor the timer to ensure beneficial transformations occur before it's reset.\n\n6. **Avoiding the Blackhole:**\n   - Plan movements away from the blackhole until absolutely necessary, as it presents a lethal hazard unless managed properly.\n   - Attract resources and regenerate health while maintaining a safe distance from the blackhole.\n\nBy progressing cautiously, carefully managing health and resources, and being aware of the dynamic threats in the environment, players can work towards securing a win while avoiding defeat over the course of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

First, I need to understand the current position of my avatar and the surrounding environment in order to make the best decision.\n\nIf my last action resulted in the avatar not moving, I will analyze the game state to determine a new direction that avoids hazards and moves towards opportunities for health regeneration or progress towards defeating the blackhole. \n\nOnce I have that context, I will select a meaningful action from the available options and provide feedback.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s proceed with the initial assessment of the current state and options available. \n\n``` Action: ACTION_LEFT ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to see if I can maneuver towards safety or towards the planets for health without facing immediate hazards. I expect this to align with the strategy of navigating carefully while managing health.",
