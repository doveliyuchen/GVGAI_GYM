    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**: \nThe game appears to belong to the action-adventure or arcade genre, with elements of a survival game. It involves strategic movement and interaction with various environmental elements while managing health and resources.\n\n**Core Mechanics**:\n- **Avatar Control**: The player controls an avatar (spaceship) that moves at a slow speed and has a limited number of health points (HP).\n- **Environmental Interactions**: The avatar can interact with several sprites (objects) in the game, including planets, bombs, a nebula, and black holes, each impacting health and status in different ways.\n- **Health Management**: The player must maintain the health of the avatar while navigating through hazardous elements like bombs and the nebula.\n- **Transformation Mechanics**: The avatar can transform empty planets into busy planets, which likely serve as resources or healing points.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe aim of the game is to survive by keeping the avatar alive while managing health points and possibly transforming planets for resources. Winning is achieved when the number of blackhole sprites is reduced to zero, signifying the removal of a significant threat.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the number of blackholes in the game is reduced to zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's health points drop to zero or if the game times out after 1000 ticks.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Health Management**: Keep a close eye on the avatar's health. Avoid interacting with bombs and the nebula that decrease health. Ideally, seek out planets to heal when health is low.\n\n2. **Safe Navigation**: Navigate the level carefully, minimizing exposure to hazards (bombs and black holes). Since the avatar moves at a slower speed (0.5), prioritize routes that avoid risky areas.\n\n3. **Planet Transformation**: Actively seek empty planets to transform them into busy planets for potential health restoration or other benefits. The transformation ensures you have safe havens to recover from damage.\n\n4. **Understanding Bomb Mechanics**: Be cautious of the random bomb spawns and their cooldowns. Avoiding them will be essential as they attract attention and can lead to losing health points.\n\n5. **Using Blackhole Mechanics to Your Advantage**: Since interacting with blackholes results in a score increase and signifies a potential threat elimination, figure out the mechanics that allow you to reduce their number safely.\n\n6. **Timing and Resource Management**: Given the presence of an atmosphere timer that affects planet transitions, manage your time effectively to optimize health recovery and transitions to busy planets.\n\n7. **Planning Routes**: Since the level layout includes many obstacles (turrents) and potential traps, plan your route through the level carefully to maximize efficiency in collecting resources while reducing exposure to hazards.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: Approach the level iteratively; familiarize yourself with enemy (bombs/turrets) locations and their patterns. Each run can help you refine strategies and paths taken.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies while remaining aware of the dynamics between health maintenance and navigation, players can effectively navigate through the challenges posed in the game while striving towards the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "Let's proceed with the game by interpreting the current state of the avatar's position, the environmental elements present, and our previously established strategy.\n\n1. **Assessing the State**: Understanding where you are positioned is crucial. If the avatar's position hasn't changed from the last state, we'll need to analyze the environment carefully and plan the next move accordingly.\n\n2. **Identifying threats and opportunities**: Look for hazards like bombs and black holes, as well as potential healing planets that we can transform. This will dictate the best course of action.\n\n3. **Choosing a Directional Action**: Based on the analysis, the best action needs to align with our focus on health management and route safety, while trying to transform planets to busy ones.\n\n4. **Feedback**: After taking an action, we'll analyze whether it resulted in a successful move or rotation and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nNow, assuming that our avatar is currently stationary and we have analyzed the immediate surroundings, I will take a directional action to start navigating effectively. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect that moving right will reveal more of the environment, allowing us to either find a healing planet or navigate away from any hazardous bombs or black holes. This aligns with our strategy of safe navigation while ensuring we manage our health and resources efficiently.",
