    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and layout of the game, it appears to be a strategy-puzzle or survival game within a space-themed environment. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the various aspects:\n\n### Game Genre:\n- **Strategy/Puzzle**: The player must navigate a tactical landscape, manage resources (like health points), and interact with different sprites strategically.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: These represent different elements in the game, including the player\u2019s avatar (a spaceship), turrets (which shoot bombs), and various planets (empty and busy).\n- **Movement and Health**: The avatar has a limited speed and health points. Interacting with certain sprites can increase or decrease health.\n- **Interactions**: Specific actions have consequences; for example, interacting with bombs can be harmful, while interacting with planets can have beneficial effects.\n- **Environment**: The layout consists of walls, interactive objects (like nebulae and blackholes), and passive entities (like planets), creating a maze-like effect.\n\n### Objectives:\n- **Primary Objective**: The goal seems to be to survive while collecting health points and possibly completing certain transformations (like changing empty planets into busy ones).\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won by eliminating all blackhole sprites (which are passive portals) before running out of health (avatar).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is killed (health points reach zero) or if the timeout limit is reached.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Interactions**: Keep clear of bombs and nebulae that can harm the avatar. Staying mobile and navigating around these dangers is crucial.\n  \n2. **Use Planets Wisely**: Land on empty planets to transform them into busy planets, contributing to your health points. Regular interactions with planets can sustain your health throughout the game.\n\n3. **Tactical Movement**: Make use of the speed of the avatar to maneuver efficiently around turrets and avoid their bomb attacks. Plan your route through the level to minimize engagement with negative sprites.\n\n4. **Engage with Blackholes**: Although they ultimately lead to victory, ensure you\u2019re safely positioned before interacting with blackholes since they may impact your score or health.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: Keeping an eye on health points and maximizing health recovery via busy planets can help extend playtime, giving more opportunities to clear blackholes.\n\n### Summary:\nThe key to success in this game lies in strategic navigation and resource management. Avoid harmful interactions, utilize advantageous sprites, and ultimately focus on clearing the level of blackholes while maintaining health points. With careful planning and movement, players can achieve a win condition efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

If my avatar has not moved in the last action taken, I will need to take a step back and reevaluate the positioning or consider a different route.\n\nPlease provide the current state of the game, including the position of my avatar and the relevant sprites nearby. This information will guide my next action effectively.",
