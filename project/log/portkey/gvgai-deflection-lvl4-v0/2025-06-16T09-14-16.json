    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here's the analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game seems to fall into the **arcade-style puzzle or survival genre**, incorporating elements of strategy and resource management. It features a top-down view, creating an environment that players must navigate to achieve certain objectives while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites serve distinct purposes:\n   - **Avatar**: Controlled by the player with health points. Players can sustain damage and have a limited number of actions.\n   - **Nebula**: A hazard that causes the avatar to lose health if contacted.\n   - **Bombs**: Can harm the player and attract attention.\n   - **Planet Interactions**: Players can heal by landing on a planet and can transform empty planets into busy ones.\n   - **Blackhole**: A hazard that can eliminate the avatar but also serves as a potential win condition.\n   - **Turrets**: They launch bombs randomly, adding a level of unpredictability to gameplay.\n\n2. **Interactions**: These define how the avatar and other sprites affect each other:\n   - Health can be lost or gained based on interactions with various objects (e.g., gaining health from planets, losing health from nebulae and bombs).\n   - The avatar can transform empty planets into busy ones upon interaction.\n   - The timer is influenced by the avatar\u2019s action near the atmosphere.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to:\n- Avoid losing all health points (e.g., via interactions with nebulae and bombs).\n- Reach a point where the number of blackholes reaches zero, signifying a win.\n- Survive within a time limit of 1000 units.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The game is won if the count of blackholes reaches zero.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The game is lost if the avatar's health points drop to zero or if the time limit is reached without achieving the win condition.\n\n### Strategic Overview\n1. **Health Management**: Players should prioritize interactions that restore health (e.g., landing on busy planets) while avoiding hazards (nebulae and bombs) that decrease health.\n\n2. **Navigational Strategy**:\n   - Be aware of the positions of turrets and bombs to avoid damage. Movement speed is slow (0.5), so planning routes carefully is essential.\n   - Use planets strategically, transforming empty planets into busy planets as a means of health recovery.\n\n3. **Resource Accumulation**: Regularly transform empty planets to busy planets to create health resources that can be utilized later in the game.\n\n4. **Avoid Blackholes**: Keep a safe distance from blackholes to prevent immediate loss of the avatar. However, they can be used strategically as they may count towards the win condition if managed properly.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Monitor the timer since there\u2019s a hard limit of 1000. Efficient movement through the level is essential to maximize health recovery and minimize damage.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires a mix of skillful navigation and strategic resource management. Players must balance managing their health and avoiding hazards while attempting to meet the overall objective of eliminating blackholes or surviving until favorable conditions arise. Successfully employing the above strategies will lead to a greater chance of winning.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

Once I have that information, I'll choose an appropriate action that adheres to the game's strategic principles. \n\nHowever, without specific information regarding the current state of my avatar (e.g., position, health points, proximity to hazards, or resources), I can't make an informed decision. Please provide details on the current game state, including the avatar's position, health status, any nearby objects (nebulae, planets, blackholes, turrets), or any recent actions taken. \n\nOnce I have that, I can choose a meaningful action aligned with the winning strategy.",
