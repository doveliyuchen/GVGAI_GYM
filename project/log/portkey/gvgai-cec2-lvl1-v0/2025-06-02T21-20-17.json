Players need to manipulate various elements on the screen, using their avatar effectively to navigate the environment and achieve specific goals.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor, Wall, and Avatar:** Basic structures for movement and position.\n   - **Light States (on/off):** Indicates whether the area is illuminated or in darkness, which may affect gameplay.\n   - **Transformations:** Using the avatar and the staff, players can change the state of various sprites (e.g., toggling lights, setting checkpoints).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls (to step back) and various states (to toggle between being on/off).\n   - The avatar seems to have a time-based transformation effect, triggering changes every second, which suggests that timing and position are crucial in navigating the level.\n\n3. **Timer Logic:** \n   - The avatar's time interactions suggest a countdown mechanism that influences the world during gameplay. This adds a layer of strategy related to managing time effectively.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to manage the transformation of sprites to meet the winning condition defined as having more \"nook\" states converted to \"to_ok\" (the limit must be 0 for a win).\n- The player also needs to be wary of a timeout condition, as exceeding a limit of 1000 will result in a loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Transform all relevant \"nook\" sprites into \"to_ok\" sprites, meeting the specified counter limit.\n- **Loss Condition:** Exceed a timer limit of 1000, which suggests a need for efficiency in action.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Understand the Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout at the beginning of the game, including obstacles (walls) and objects (light states, nooks).\n\n2. **Plan Movements:**\n   - Use the avatar to navigate through the level smartly, ensuring you minimize unnecessary movements against walls.\n\n3. **Timing is Key:**\n   - Pay close attention to the timing of mechanics. Since interactions are time-based, strategize your movements and actions to make the most of each tick\u2014oscillate between on/off states when advantageous.\n\n4. **Transform Wisely:**\n   - Use the staff to efficiently change states. Focus on maximizing the transformation of nooks into \"to_ok\" efficiently while using the light toggling wisely to keep the environment navigable.\n\n5. **Avoid Timeout:**\n   - Keep track of the remaining time. Even though actions repeat and may allow continuous transformations, aim to reach the objectives before reaching the timeout limit.\n\nBy mastering these elements and developing a consistent tactical approach to movement, interaction, and timing, players can increase their chances of winning in this intricately designed puzzle environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> #\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> a\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I see that my avatar 'a' is positioned at (row 6, col 2). The immediate surroundings (row 6) are clear except for walls ($) at the boundaries. The main goal is to manipulate the environment using the avatar\u2019s actions and the staff based on the mechanics described.\n\n1. **Current State Analysis**: \n   - The avatar's options to interact with the environment seem limited due to walls blocking most of the movement horizontally. Vertically, there are clear lanes either up or down.\n   \n2. **Next Move Consideration**:\n   - The most logical move initially would be to explore upwards or downwards. Moving down (to row 7, col 2) is not possible because it's a wall. Therefore, moving upwards towards (row 5, col 2) seems more strategic since it has more floor space and possible interactions.\n\n3. **Movement Decision**:\n   - I will proceed with the upward action to (row 5, col 2) to explore further and potentially interact with any light features or other sprites in that area.\n\nTaking all this into account, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action is aimed at moving upwards, and I expect to position myself in a clearer space for future interactions with the environment as I analyze how to efficiently convert the nooks based on their states.",
