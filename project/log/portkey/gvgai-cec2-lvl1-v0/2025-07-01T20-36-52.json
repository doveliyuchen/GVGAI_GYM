The use of sprites and interactions indicates a focus on solving problems and navigating through levels.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Different sprites represent various elements in the game world, such as walls, floors, light states (on/off), and interactive objects which include the player's avatar and different types of switches (like \"nook\" and \"ok\").\n- **Interactions:** The avatar has specific interactions with walls, light states, and special tiles. There are transformation actions based on the avatar\u2019s interactions with other elements, dictated by a timer.\n- **Timed Events:** The timer helps change the state of other sprites repetitively. This indicates the need for strategic planning around timing to successfully navigate the level.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to manipulate the state of sprites to achieve a win condition. This typically involves activating certain sprites (like \"to_ok\" and \"to_nook\") while navigating the constraints of walls and other barriers.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Conditions:** You win by transforming all applicable sprites of type \"nook\" into \"to_ok,\" achieving a MultiSpriteCounter limit of 0. This implies that you need to successfully manage your interactions with \"nook\" sprites until they are all activated.\n- **Losing Condition:** The game can be lost if a timeout occurs (specifically if the action limit of 1000 is reached without achieving the necessary conditions). This suggests that players must work efficiently to avoid running out of time.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Understand the Layout:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout, including where walls and other sprites are located.\n2. **Plan Sprite Transformations:** Check how changes from \"lightoff\" to \"lighton\" and others impact the environment, as these transformations seem crucial for accessing new areas or unlocking other sprites.\n3. **Manage Timing:** Pay attention to the timer and plan your moves to ensure that the interactions occur at the correct intervals, especially since many actions are on a repeating cycle. This will be essential to keep all processes in sync.\n4. **Test Different Routes:** If you find yourself stuck, explore different combinations of interactions and timings, and track which paths enable further progress toward achieving the win condition.\n5. **Iterate Through Interactions:** Since interactions are based on the avatar's state, use trial and error to find effective sequences for activating \"to_ok\" and \"to_nook\" sprites. \n\nBy implementing these strategies while navigating the puzzle environment, players can effectively work through the level, achieve the objectives, and ultimately secure a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> #\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

There are various interactions available around me, particularly light states and a few special tiles.\n\n### Observations:\n- I have two open spaces (.) directly above me at (row 5, col 5) and (row 5, col 6) that I can interact with.\n- The adjacent squares to the left and right of my current position do not have special sprites and are floors (.), which do not contribute to achieving win conditions with \"nook\" or \"ok\" states.\n- The main task will be to step onto spaces that can potentially help in activating more sprites.\n\n### Next Action:\nTo progress, the best action seems to be to move **UP** to (row 5, col 5) from my current position. This should also help clear the way to potentially interact with the next layers of tiles that could either unlock light states or involve nearby sprites.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move is strategic because it will allow me to explore more of the gameplay mechanics while moving up the board, possibly leading to activating necessary sprites. I expect to encounter new tiles in the next step and gain further insight into how to achieve the goals.",
