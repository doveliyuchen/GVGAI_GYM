It involves navigating a character (the avatar) through a spatial environment while interacting with various game mechanics to solve challenges.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor and Walls:** These represent the navigable space and boundaries, respectively.\n   - **Light States (lightoff/lighton):** These sprites change based on the player's interactions, likely impacting visibility or mechanics in the game.\n   - **Avatar and Staff:** The player controls the avatar with a staff that can transform into different states or powers.\n   - **Interaction Sprites (ok, nook, transits):** These seem to represent hidden objects or areas and are essential for solving puzzles.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, resulting in a step back, suggesting obstacles.\n   - The staff can toggle between two light states affecting the environment.\n   - Different timed interactions with the avatar will transform sprites, likely essential to progressing through the level.\n\n3. **Time Mechanism:**\n   - The use of a timer indicates that certain actions or transformations need to occur within a set time frame to succeed. \n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective appears to be transforming the necessary sprites from one type to another (e.g., from 'nook' to 'ok') to satisfy the winning condition, which is based on the transformation and counting mechanism.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching a state where the multi-sprite counter (for the transition from 'nook' to 'ok') hits zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player fails if the timer reaches 1000 without achieving the win condition.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand Your Surroundings:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Note where walls are and how they obstruct movement.\n\n2. **Utilize Time Wisely:**\n   - Carefully plan out your moves. Since transformations happen over time, ensure that you're using your time effectively to switch states as needed.\n\n3. **Interact Systematically:**\n   - Focus on transforming one state at a time. For example, prioritize transforming 'nook' to 'ok' as this is key to winning.\n\n4. **Experiment with Light States:**\n   - Make sure to test the effects of switching between 'lighton' and 'lightoff' to see if they reveal hidden areas or enable interactions you might have overlooked.\n\n5. **Pay Attention to Interaction Mechanics:**\n   - Use your staff wisely. Depending on the state of the sprite that you interact with, your actions can lead to essential transformations\u2014plan your actions accordingly.\n\n6. **Track Progress:**\n   - Keep an eye on both the timer and any visual indicators of your progress in transforming sprites. If you are approaching the timeout limit, reevaluate your strategy quickly.\n\nBy carefully navigating the level, using your interactions strategically, and managing your time effectively, you'll be well-positioned to succeed in this puzzle-adventure game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> #\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> a\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",
