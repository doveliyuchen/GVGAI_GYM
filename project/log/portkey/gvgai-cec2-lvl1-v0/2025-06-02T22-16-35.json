For example:\n     - It can step back if it hits a wall.\n     - It can toggle the state of the light ('lighton' and 'lightoff') using a staff.\n     - The avatar transforms various sprites to trigger different statuses, creating a dynamic environment with potential variables based on time constraints.\n\n3. **Timer Mechanic:**\n   - The game includes a timer mechanic where transformations occur every second, introducing a sense of urgency to the gameplay.\n\n#### Objective\nThe goal of the game is to manipulate the environment to achieve a state where all the 'nook' sprites are transformed into the 'ok' sprites. This is achieved by reaching a condition of multi-sprite counting through time-based transformations (to_nook and to_ok states). \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - The player wins when all 'nook' sprites have been transformed into 'ok' sprites (the limit is reached).\n  \n- **Loss Condition:**\n  - The player loses if the timer runs out (timeout limit of 1000).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand the Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout and the location of different sprites. This includes knowing where walls and objects are to avoid unnecessary steps back.\n\n2. **Plan Transformations:**\n   - Use the staff to toggle between 'lighton' and 'lightoff' strategically. The correct timing is crucial, so plan when to activate these transformations based on your progress.\n\n3. **Manage Time Efficiently:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer while performing transformations. Efficiently utilizing the repeating timer actions can help you convert nooks to oks before time runs out.\n\n4. **Prioritize Interactions:**\n   - Engage with sprites that bring you closer to your objective first. For example, prioritize reaching nooks and converting them into oks.\n\n5. **Practice Patience and Strategy:**\n   - Since the mechanics involve timing and stepping back due to walls, a patient and thoughtful approach is necessary to avoid traps and optimize sprite interactions.\n\nBy employing this strategy, players will be better equipped to manage the game mechanics and achieve victory within the time constraints.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> #\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> a\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",
