    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and a possible overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players control an avatar navigating through a grid-like environment filled with walls, obstacles, and interactive elements, where solving puzzles is essential to progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game uses various sprites that represent different objects in the environment (e.g., walls, floors, lights, and the avatar). The avatar can interact with each of these sprites based on predefined interactions.\n  \n2. **Interactions**: The avatar can trigger specific transformations using the staff:\n   - **Lights**: The avatar can switch between 'light on' and 'light off' states.\n   - **Transformation States**: The staff can transform items into several states (to_off, to_on, to_ok, to_nook), which likely represent different puzzle mechanics or goals.\n   - **Wall Interaction**: The avatar cannot pass through walls but steps back when attempting to interact with them.\n\n3. **Timer Functionality**: The avatar can trigger timed changes to the sprites, affecting the environment dynamically.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective seems to be to interact with the environment to change the states of different sprites and eventually reach a winning condition:\n- The game is won by achieving a situation where there are no active 'nook' states remaining (as indicated by the win condition with `MultiSpriteCounter stype1=nook stype2=to_ok limit=0 win=True`).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if all 'nook' sprites are converted into 'ok' sprites (i.e., when the `nook` count is reduced to 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the timer counts down to a limit of 1000 without achieving the win condition.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before making moves, observe the layout and plan several steps ahead to ensure that each interaction leads towards converting 'nook' sprites to 'ok'.\n  \n2. **Utilize the Timer**: Make use of the timer-based interactions strategically. Trigger timed events wisely to create or remove lights, affecting visibility and sprite states when necessary.\n\n3. **Master Interactions**: Understand how each sprite interacts with the staff. For example, switching between light states may be key in advancing puzzles, so learn to leverage these changes effectively.\n\n4. **Be Mindful of Walls**: Always consider wall interactions since touching walls causes the avatar to step back. Plan paths that avoid inefficient retracement.\n\n5. **Monitor State Changes**: Keep a close watch on the counts of active nooks and on what stage each sprite is in. Adjust your strategy dynamically based on these counts to minimize time wastage.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and closely monitoring the game mechanics, players will be well-prepared to navigate the challenges and solve the puzzles presented.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> #\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> a\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

It\u2019s also worth noting that stepping to an empty floor could help us observe further.\n\nConsidering that our last position doesn't change after rotation when moving, we need to ensure we've evaluated enough potential changes. Moving left would interact with a sprite that could play into any future puzzle actions due to its status as a light/off sprite.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will choose to move **left (5, 6)**.\n\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\nThis action is taken to explore the lightoff floor, which may allow further state changes crucial for progressing towards winning conditions.",
