The mechanics suggest a grid-based format typically found in puzzle games.\n\n### Gameplay Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites representing different elements \u2014 walls, floors, lights, and the avatar (the player character).\n   - **Immovable sprites** (walls, floor) define the game's navigational boundaries.\n   - **Passive sprites** represent states of lights (on/off) affected by player actions.\n   - The **avatar** interacts with these elements, specifically with the staff to change states or affect the environment.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls, causing a \"step back\" action.\n   - Using the staff, the avatar can toggle lights on and off and interact with specific invisible elements (ok, nook, and transits) to trigger transformations.\n   - There seems to be a time-based mechanic where certain transformations occur on a timer.\n\n3. **Timer Mechanic**: The game features a timer that affects the ability to switch between states (light on/off, ok/nook) repeatedly, which adds a layer of time management to the player's strategy.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to achieve a transformation that meets the winning condition before the timeout (maximum limit of 1000).\n- To win, the player must manipulate the sprites to satisfy the condition: transforming the 'nook' into 'ok' until the counter of these transformations reaches the limit of 0.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully transform the nook sprite into the ok sprite using the avatar's interactions in such a way that the MultiSpriteCounter reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: Running out of time (reaching a timeout of 1000).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Higher Transformations**: Focus on gradually converting the nook to ok through systematic interactions while ensuring not to run out of time. Each transformation happens through using the staff in the correct contexts, so knowing when to act is crucial.\n\n2. **Manage Timer Effectively**: Since the timer is central to interactions, it is crucial to time your actions so that you can initiate transformations repeatedly without triggering any loss condition due to timer expiration.\n\n3. **Map Awareness**: Understanding the level layout and how walls divide areas will help in planning moves effectively, avoiding unnecessary steps back when meeting walls.\n\n4. **Experiment with Light States**: Utilizing the interactions that change the light states can help open up further pathways or interactions, so frequently using the staff on light-related sprites in line with the timer is advisable.\n\n5. **Watch the Counter**: Keep an eye on the MultiSpriteCounter to ensure that the transformations are progressing correctly. Knowing how many interactions are necessary for victory will help in pacing other actions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis game demands strategic thinking, time management, and an intricate understanding of how different elements interact with each other. By focusing on the mechanics of transformation and being mindful of time, players can effectively navigate the challenges and reach the objective.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nlightoff floor -> '0'\nlighton floor -> '1'\nlightoff nook floor -> 'b'\nlighton nook floor -> 'c'\nlightoff ok floor -> 'd'\nfloor lightoff -> '@'\nfloor lighton -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nfloor staff -> '%'\nstaff wall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> #\nrow=2, col=15 -> @\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> #\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> #\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> #\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> #\nrow=4, col=13 -> #\nrow=4, col=14 -> #\nrow=4, col=15 -> @\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> @\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> @\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> $\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> $\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=16 -> $\nrow=7, col=17 -> $\nrow=7, col=18 -> $",

The avatar is currently next to the staff (position (6, 3)), which is crucial since it allows the avatar to interact with various sprites in the environment.\n\nGiven the important mechanics notice, I need to remember that a directional action might only cause a rotation without moving the avatar immediately, especially when adjacent to walls or other obstacles.\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. The avatar is positioned on a floor tile, and to the left is the staff.\n2. In this layout, there are various elements, including light states and the boundaries created by walls.\n3. There are no immediate threats (such as a timeout) visible, as I have not done any actions yet.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nThe primary next step should be to interact with the staff, as it will enable further interactions with the sprites.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nInteracting with the staff should allow the avatar to influence the environment effectively, aligning with our objective to manipulate light states and ultimately achieve the desired transformations.",
