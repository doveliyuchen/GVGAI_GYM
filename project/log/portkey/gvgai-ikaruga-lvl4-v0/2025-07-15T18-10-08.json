The presence of avatars, bullets, bombs, and aliens suggests a fast-paced game where players must navigate and interact with various sprites while avoiding or engaging enemies.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n- **Sprites**: There are multiple sprite types (avatars, bullets, aliens, bombs) with distinct properties and behaviors. Some sprites are immovable (like walls and backgrounds), while others can move, shoot, or explode.\n- **Interactions**: The interactions between different sprites determine the outcomes of player actions. For instance:\n  - The avatar can be killed by aliens or bombs.\n  - There are transformation mechanics (blackAvatar to whiteAvatar and vice versa) involving changers.\n  - Score impacts based on interactions (like killing aliens with bullets).\n  \n**Objective**:\n- The main objective is to reach a point where all portals and aliens are eliminated (indicated by the condition \"MultiSpriteCounter stype1=portal stype2=alien limit=0\"). The player must keep their avatar alive while also scoring points by defeating aliens.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won by ensuring that there are no portals and aliens left in play (when the counters for both reach zero).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for avatar limit reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Movement and Positioning**:\n   - Keep a safe distance from enemies (aliens and bombs) to avoid taking damage. Always be aware of the walls and edges of the game area to avoid getting trapped. Use your movement wisely to create space and evade projectiles.\n\n2. **Utilize Changers Wisely**:\n   - Use the changers strategically to transform your avatar between the white and black versions to interface effectively with different types of bullets. This transformation can allow you to both evade and counter threats based on the enemy types you encounter.\n\n3. **Engage with Caution**:\n   - When attacking aliens, make sure to use the correct type of bullet (white or black) to ensure a kill and gain points. Always be prepared to retreat if things go awry.\n\n4. **Prioritize Targets**:\n   - Focus on eliminating aliens before they can do damage to you. Use your bullets to counter aliens effectively and try to maintain a positive score. Being aggressive will help keep the number of aliens and portals in check.\n\n5. **Monitor Sprite Counts**:\n   - Keep track of the number of portals and aliens that remain in play. This can guide your offensive and defensive strategies as you approach the game's end conditions.\n\n6. **Use Bombs Strategically**:\n   - The bombs can be devastating but must be used judiciously to avoid killing yourself or your bullets. Their strategic deployment can clear the area of threats but also comes with risk.\n\n7. **Plan Ahead for Portals**:\n   - Since portals are linked to enemy spawns, controlling or destroying these should be a priority as you clear the board.\n\nBy employing careful movement, utilizing transformation mechanics, and strategically engaging, players can maximize their chances of winning and achieving a high score in this dynamic game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwall background -> 'o'\nwhitePortal1 background -> 'q'\nblackPortal1 background -> 'w'\nwhitePortal2 background -> 'e'\nblackPortal2 background -> 'r'\nwhiteAvatar background -> 'A'\nwChangerPortal background -> 'z'\nbChangerPortal background -> 'x'\nbackground -> '.'\nblackAlien -> '@'\nblackAlien blackChanger -> '#'\nblackAlien whiteChanger -> '$'\nblackChanger -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nwhiteAlien -> '*'\nwhiteAvatar -> 'b'\nwhiteChanger -> 'w'\nblackAlien blackChanger whiteAlien -> 'c'\nblackAlien whiteAlien -> 'd'\nblackAlien whiteAlien whiteChanger -> 'f'\nblackChanger whiteAlien -> 'g'\nwhiteAlien whiteChanger -> 'h'\nblackAlien blackChanger bomb whiteAlien -> 'i'\nblackAlien bomb -> 'j'\nblackAlien bomb whiteAlien -> 'k'\nblackChanger bomb whiteAlien -> 'l'\nblackChanger bomb -> 'm'\nbomb whiteAlien -> 'n'\nbomb -> 'p'\nwhiteAvatar whiteBullet -> 's'\nwhiteBullet -> 't'\nblackAvatar -> 'u'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> .\nrow=0, col=2 -> .\nrow=0, col=3 -> .\nrow=0, col=4 -> .\nrow=0, col=5 -> .\nrow=0, col=6 -> .\nrow=0, col=7 -> .\nrow=0, col=8 -> .\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> *\nrow=3, col=6 -> *\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> @\nrow=4, col=8 -> @\nrow=4, col=9 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> @\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> d\nrow=6, col=2 -> d\nrow=6, col=3 -> d\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> d\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> d\nrow=6, col=9 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> n\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> k\nrow=8, col=2 -> @\nrow=8, col=3 -> p\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> d\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=10, col=0 -> &\nrow=10, col=1 -> @\nrow=10, col=2 -> @\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> *\nrow=10, col=5 -> *\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> @\nrow=10, col=8 -> @\nrow=10, col=9 -> &\nrow=11, col=0 -> &\nrow=11, col=1 -> j\nrow=11, col=2 -> d\nrow=11, col=3 -> *\nrow=11, col=4 -> *\nrow=11, col=5 -> *\nrow=11, col=6 -> *\nrow=11, col=7 -> d\nrow=11, col=8 -> @\nrow=11, col=9 -> &\nrow=12, col=0 -> &\nrow=12, col=1 -> k\nrow=12, col=2 -> d\nrow=12, col=3 -> *\nrow=12, col=4 -> *\nrow=12, col=5 -> *\nrow=12, col=6 -> *\nrow=12, col=7 -> d\nrow=12, col=8 -> d\nrow=12, col=9 -> &\nrow=13, col=0 -> &\nrow=13, col=1 -> d\nrow=13, col=2 -> @\nrow=13, col=3 -> @\nrow=13, col=4 -> n\nrow=13, col=5 -> *\nrow=13, col=6 -> @\nrow=13, col=7 -> @\nrow=13, col=8 -> d\nrow=13, col=9 -> &\nrow=14, col=0 -> &\nrow=14, col=1 -> d\nrow=14, col=2 -> d\nrow=14, col=3 -> d\nrow=14, col=4 -> n\nrow=14, col=5 -> *\nrow=14, col=6 -> d\nrow=14, col=7 -> @\nrow=14, col=8 -> d\nrow=14, col=9 -> &\nrow=15, col=0 -> &\nrow=15, col=1 -> *\nrow=15, col=2 -> *\nrow=15, col=3 -> *\nrow=15, col=4 -> p\nrow=15, col=5 -> .\nrow=15, col=6 -> *\nrow=15, col=7 -> .\nrow=15, col=8 -> *\nrow=15, col=9 -> &\nrow=16, col=0 -> &\nrow=16, col=1 -> *\nrow=16, col=2 -> .\nrow=16, col=3 -> p\nrow=16, col=4 -> p\nrow=16, col=5 -> .\nrow=16, col=6 -> .\nrow=16, col=7 -> .\nrow=16, col=8 -> *\nrow=16, col=9 -> &\nrow=17, col=0 -> &\nrow=17, col=1 -> .\nrow=17, col=2 -> .\nrow=17, col=3 -> p\nrow=17, col=4 -> p\nrow=17, col=5 -> .\nrow=17, col=6 -> .\nrow=17, col=7 -> .\nrow=17, col=8 -> .\nrow=17, col=9 -> &\nrow=18, col=0 -> &\nrow=18, col=1 -> .\nrow=18, col=2 -> .\nrow=18, col=3 -> .\nrow=18, col=4 -> b\nrow=18, col=5 -> .\nrow=18, col=6 -> .\nrow=18, col=7 -> .\nrow=18, col=8 -> .\nrow=18, col=9 -> &",

My avatar needs to interact with the environment strategically. The surrounding cells include various enemies and bombs, particularly in rows above the avatar's current position.\n2. Most importantly, movement must ensure safety while attempting to reach and destroy enemies. There are bombs at (8, 3), (15, 3), and (16, 3) that can be used strategically.\n3. In this case, since the avatar's position is stable, we have to analyze a different move.\n\n### Suggested Action:\n- Since the avatar is at (18, 4) and the first action is to move left, which takes the avatar to (18, 3). This move will position the avatar in an area adjacent to a white bullet, thus potentially allowing an attack on nearby entities while maintaining a safe distance.\n  \nThus, I will take the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nMoving left allows me to target threats from a better position while preparing to use available resources effectively. This aligns with the strategy of prioritizing a careful approach to enemy engagement.",
