If possible, use walls and other obstacles to block the chase.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the boxes strategically to interact with walls and holes. Bouncing boxes can help create pathways or eliminate threats.\n\n3. **Collect Coins**: Gather coins whenever possible as they add to your score and may indicate progress in the level.\n\n4. **Leverage Switches**: If you encounter a switch, use it wisely. Spawning walls can change the dynamics of the level by blocking off threats or creating new pathways.\n\n5. **Plan Moves**: Always assess the consequences of each move, particularly when interacting with boxes, as they can result in being pushed back or eliminate your chances of survival.\n\n6. **Explore Layout**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout to find the best routes for completing your objectives.\n\nThis strategic mix of avoidance, resource management, and spatial awareness will help navigate through the challenges of the game and work towards achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> e\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",
