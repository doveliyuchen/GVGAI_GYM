The player navigates through a grid-based level, interacting with various sprites to achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game features several types of sprites including:\n  - **Immovable** (floor, hole, wall, coin, switch): These cannot be moved and play various roles in the game.\n  - **Passive** (box): Can be moved but does not affect the game directly until interacted with.\n  - **Moving/Chaser** (piranha): Actively seeks out the avatar, providing a threat.\n  - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that interacts with other sprites.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - **Movement Mechanic**: The avatar can bounce off boxes and interact with other sprites like switching and collecting coins.\n  - **Chasing Mechanic**: The piranha chases the avatar, adding an element of danger.\n  - **Switch Mechanic**: Activating a switch can spawn walls, which may act as barriers or obstacles.\n  - **Destructive Mechanic**: Certain interactions can result in \"killing\" sprites, impacting the game state.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes present on the level. This is indicated by the win condition: when the sprite counter for boxes reaches zero, the player wins. The player's score can also be incremented by interacting with coins and knocking boxes into holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they manage to eliminate all boxes from the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Careful Movement**: Navigate the avatar wisely to avoid the piranha, focusing on using the walls and other sprites to block its path.\n  \n2. **Maximize Box Interaction**: Utilize the boxes effectively. Bounce them into holes to eliminate them while trying to avoid edge cases where the box could get stuck or placed in a position that makes it hard to interact with.\n\n3. **Use Coins Wisely**: Collect coins whenever feasible to boost your score while ensuring that you don\u2019t put yourself in harm's way.\n\n4. **Switch Management**: Be strategic about activating switches. Since they spawn walls, use them to create barriers between you and the piranha or to funnel the boxes into holes.\n\n5. **Plan Exit Routes**: Always have a safe route planned out in case you need to escape the piranha. Reassess your position frequently to ensure that you do not get cornered.\n\n6. **Timing and Patience**: Coordinate your movements with the cooldown of the piranha and the box interactions to minimize the risk of getting annihilated.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through levels successfully while minimizing risks and focused on eliminating all boxes to achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> a\nrow=9, col=4 -> e\nrow=9, col=5 -> e\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",
