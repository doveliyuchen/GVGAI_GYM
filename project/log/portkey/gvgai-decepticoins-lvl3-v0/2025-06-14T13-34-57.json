    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules you've provided, it appears to be a puzzle-platformer game with elements of strategy. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key components:\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Puzzle-Platformer:** The player must navigate through a level filled with obstacles and mechanics that require problem-solving and careful movement to progress. \n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game has various types of sprites (floor, wall, hole, box, coin, switch, moving), each with unique properties and interactions.\n- **Movement:** The player's avatar can move around the level and interact with various objects. \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can collect coins for points.\n  - Boxes can be used to bounce the avatar forward, which indicates a focus on negotiation of space and maneuverability.\n  - The player can interact with switches to spawn walls, which adds a layer of strategy.\n  - Certain interactions (e.g., box into hole or box into the wall) have consequences like losing or resetting progress.\n\n### Objective\n- **Main Objective:** The player wins by eliminating all boxes (SpriteCounter for boxes hits zero).\n- **Collectibles:** Collecting coins appears to be an additional goal that may provide score benefits but is likely secondary to the main objective.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no remaining boxes on the level.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Before jumping or moving the avatar, take time to plan moves carefully to avoid traps and ensure boxes are placed wisely.\n  \n2. **Utilize Boxes:** Use the boxes not just to navigate but strategically push them towards holes if needed while ensuring you don't get stuck between walls or drop them in ways that hinder your progress.\n\n3. **Manage Interactions with the Piranha:** Be cautious of the piranha and try to avoid its path to preserve your avatar. Knowing when to make moves and evade may be crucial.\n\n4. **Coin Collection:** While the primary goal is the boxes, collecting coins can help build confidence and provide bonuses, so incorporate this into your route if possible.\n\n5. **Make Use of Switches Actively:** Activating switches may generate obstacles that could either help you or pose additional challenges. Keep track of what switches you activate and their effects on the level surroundings.\n\n6. **Monitor Your Progress**: Be aware of how many boxes are left, and keep track of your interactions to avoid sudden pitfalls that could lead to game loss.\n\nWith these mechanics and strategies in mind, you will be better positioned to navigate levels effectively and focus on achieving victory by eliminating all boxes while managing obstacles and enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> a\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",

    "content": "To start analyzing the current game state, let's summarize the avatar's position and the surrounding environment:\n\n- The avatar ('a') is located at (9, 1).\n- To the right at (9, 2) is a piranha ('e'), which poses a threat.\n- Moving down into (10, 1) is not an option because it's a wall. \n- The only reachable tiles appear to be (9, 0) which is a wall and (9, 3) to the right, which is free.\n\nGiven this state, I cannot move left or down as they are both blocked by walls. Moving up is also not possible since (8, 1) is also a wall.\n\nSince my options are limited, the only action that makes sense is to move right to (9, 3). This will allow the avatar to avoid the piranha in the next turn, and it is crucial to maintain movement to avoid being trapped.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n```Action:2```\n\nBy moving right, I expect to keep my avatar in a safer position away from the piranha, while also enabling future moves towards potentially collecting coins or eliminating boxes.",
