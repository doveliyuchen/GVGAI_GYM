    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules described, here\u2019s a structured analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game falls into the **puzzle-platformer** genre, involving elements of navigation, strategy, and obstacle avoidance.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include the 'floor', 'hole', 'wall', and 'coin', which cannot be moved and create the level structure.\n   - **Passive Sprite:** The 'box' can be interacted with but does not move on its own.\n   - **Moving Sprite:** The 'avatar' (player character) moves freely, implying player control. \n   - **Chaser Sprite:** The 'piranha' acts as a moving enemy that follows the avatar and can cause a game over if it catches the player.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can collect coins, manipulate boxes to bounce, and trigger switches that affect the environment (like spawning walls).\n   - Certain interactions lead to losing the game, such as the avatar encountering the piranha or causing a box to fall into a hole.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to clear the level by manipulating boxes to reach a goal (with a limit on the number of boxes available). The player must also collect coins for points while avoiding deadly encounters with the piranha.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when all boxes are removed from the level.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar's count drops to zero (the avatar is killed).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid the Piranha:** Keep moving to evade the piranha. Stay aware of its cooldown (8 seconds) to predict its movement.\n  \n2. **Manage Box Interactions:**\n   - Use boxes strategically to bounce into otherwise unreachable areas or to trigger environmental changes.\n   - Be cautious when pushing boxes towards holes, as it results in immediate loss of that box and creates a scoring change (1 point).\n\n3. **Collect Coins:** Focus on collecting coins as you navigate the level. Grab them whenever safe, as they contribute to your score.\n\n4. **Use Switches Wisely:** If you trigger a switch, be aware of its consequences, like spawning walls that could restrict your movement.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path:** Before navigating, visualize your moves. Getting boxed in or trapped by walls or the piranha could lead to a quick loss.\n\n6. **Experiment and Learn:** If there's time, try different strategies to understand the timing of the piranha and how best to manipulate the boxes.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of clearing levels while avoiding failure conditions. Remember to stay adaptable and react quickly to changes in the environment posed by the piranha and the walls.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> a\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> e\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",
