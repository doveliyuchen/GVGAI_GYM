It involves navigating a character through an obstacle course with the goal of solving puzzles, avoiding enemies, and collecting items.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game utilizes various types of sprites, including immovable objects like floors, walls, holes, and coins, as well as an avatar (the player's character) and an enemy (piranha).\n- **Interaction:** The avatar can interact with different sprites:\n  - Walls are impassable.\n  - The piranha is a hostile sprite that will kill the avatar if they come into contact.\n  - Boxes can be moved by the avatar and used to bounce forward.\n  - Coins increase the player's score upon collection.\n  - Switches can spawn walls and affect gameplay mechanics.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- **Primary Objective:** The main goal is to eliminate all boxes to win the game (since it states that reaching 0 boxes results in a win condition).\n- **Secondary Objective:** Players can also gather coins to increase their score.\n  \n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the number of boxes reaches zero (SpriteCounter for boxes).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the player's avatar is eliminated (when the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Avoid the Piranha:** Keep a safe distance from the piranha, as contact will eliminate the avatar. Consider using boxes as buffers between the avatar and the piranha.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:** Since boxes can bounce the avatar forward, use them strategically to navigate levels and avoid hazards. Consider how moving a box can also change the landscape (for instance, pushing it into a hole to dispose of it safely).\n\n3. **Collect Coins:** While the primary goal remains to eliminate boxes, collecting coins can enhance the score. Attempt to collect these along the way as you move through the level.\n\n4. **Engage Switches Cautiously:** When stepping on switches, be aware of their effects. They can spawn walls that may block your path or hinder your movement. Use them when necessary but bear the consequences in mind.\n\n5. **Plan Movements:** Before making a move near walls, boxes, or switches, think ahead. Visualize the consequences of your actions and how they impact both the immediate environment and future movements.\n\n6. **Preserve Your Avatar:** Always be mindful of your avatar's health and avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to losing it. When navigating tight spaces, prefer safe movement options over aggressive tactics.\n\nPlaying through the levels while employing these strategies will help navigate the puzzles and successfully achieve the game's objectives while minimizing the chances of losing your avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> a\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",

    "content": "In the current state of the game, my avatar is located at (7, 1) and there are two piranhas located at (8, 1) and (9, 2), putting my avatar in a vulnerable position as it is very close to one of the piranhas. The immediate goal is to avoid the piranhas while also paying attention to the layout of boxes and walls.\n\nTo make a strategic move, I should prioritize moving away from the piranha at (8, 1) because it is just below my current position. Thus, moving up might not be a good option either since there would be no space to move up (walls on row 6).\n\nThe best course of action is to move to the left (to (7, 0)), however, this tile is a wall, which makes it impossible to move left. \n\nMoving down to (8, 1) will result in getting eliminated since there is a piranha there. The only other options left are either to stay where I am (which wouldn't change anything) or to assess the overall strategy and adapt - this means I should ideally plan to make a move away from the danger.\n\nSince moving left, down, or up isn\u2019t an option due to walls or danger, I will choose to rotate to the right and then down. \n\nGiven these constraints, I will execute the action to move down, anticipating a need to either reposition further down or respond to subsequent actions of the piranha should it be necessary.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis movement is aimed at clearing the immediate threat from the piranha above and will also allow me further options to navigate the level. I expect to reevaluate the situation based on where the piranha moves next.",
