    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, the game can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fall into the puzzle-platformer genre. The player controls an avatar navigating through a grid-like environment, solving challenges and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Provides a base for movement.\n   - **Hole**: Represents a hazard that leads to failure if the avatar interacts with it.\n   - **Box**: A passive element that can be interacted with to bounce the avatar forward.\n   - **Wall**: Immovable elements that block pathways and can influence box movements.\n   - **Coin**: Collectible items that increase the score.\n   - **Switch**: Triggers actions when the avatar steps on it, such as spawning walls or removing itself.\n   - **Piranha**: A moving enemy that chases the avatar and can kill it upon contact.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins for points and use boxes for movement strategies.\n   - Encountering the piranha results in a game over.\n   - Stepping on a switch can spawn walls behind the avatar, creating new obstacles.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game is lost if the avatar is killed (Sprites of avatar reach zero).\n   - The game is won if all boxes are removed from the level (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches zero).\n\n### Objectives:\n- The primary goal is to collect coins and avoid the piranha, while strategically moving boxes to navigate through the level.\n- Ensure to manipulate the avatar\u2019s environment to avoid hazards and successfully remove all boxes to win.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: Remove all boxes from the level by using strategic movement and interactions.\n- **Loss**: The avatar comes into contact with the piranha or falls into a hole.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Be cautious about movement since the piranha is actively chasing the avatar. Utilize walls and boxes to create a safe route.\n  \n2. **Box Management**: Utilize the boxes to bounce the avatar into areas where coins are located, and ensure they do not fall into holes as that will lead to loss.\n\n3. **Switch Usage**: Use the switches wisely. Understand that activating a switch can spawn new walls which may block paths, but can also serve as a strategic barrier against the piranha.\n\n4. **Plan Routes**: Before moving, analyze potential movements to avoid unnecessary interactions with the piranha. Move strategically to collect coins while ensuring an escape route from threats.\n\n5. **Minimal Risk**: Prioritize collecting coins and disposing of boxes while avoiding direct confrontation with the piranha. If necessary, create distractions using boxes to maneuver around the enemy.\n\nBy applying these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the level to collect coins, avoid hazards, and ultimately win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\nbox floor piranha -> '$'\nfloor hole piranha -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> a\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> e\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",

The next column to the right (9, 3) is clear, so moving to this position is the most strategic action to avoid the piranhas and remain on safe ground.\n\nBy moving right, you also gain an opportunity to explore potential avenues for collecting coins while staying clear of hazards. Since my avatar is adjacent to danger and does not alter position with a rotation action, I will choose to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to move to a safer position and avoids immediate contact with the piranhas. My expectation is to create more strategic options for collecting coins while minimizing risk.",
