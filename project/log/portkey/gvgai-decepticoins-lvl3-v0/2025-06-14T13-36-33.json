    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle platformer**, where players navigate through levels using strategy and problem-solving while managing various obstacles and objectives. \n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - Different immovable and movable objects like floors, holes, walls, boxes, coins, and switches.\n   - The avatar controlled by the player (represented by the knight sprite), which can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - A chaser enemy called a piranha that targets the player.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins and destroy boxes or be attacked by the piranha.\n   - The avatar can push boxes which can bounce and cause interaction with walls.\n   - Boxes can be dangerous if they fall into holes.\n   - Coins are beneficial; they add to the player's score.\n   - Switches may spawn walls or be collectable.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to collect all boxes (as per the win condition) without losing the player avatar. This requires careful navigation to ensure no boxes fall into holes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no remaining boxes (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost as soon as the player avatar is no longer alive (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Move the avatar carefully to avoid confrontations with the piranha. Use walls and switches to manage the environment, preventing piranhas from getting too close.\n\n2. **Box Management**: Manipulate boxes strategically to make sure that none fall into the holes. Use the bounce interaction wisely to push boxes around safely.\n\n3. **Prioritize Collectibles**: Collect coins when it's safe to boost your score while focusing on box management.\n\n4. **Use Switches Effectively**: Activate switches to manipulate the layout, creating barriers or temporarily blocking paths the piranha might take.\n\n5. **Plan Moves Ahead**: Always think a few steps ahead in your navigation, considering the potential interactions and the piranha's cooldown to ensure you can react quickly to changes.\n\n### Level Map Analysis\n- The layout has walls bordering a central area with spaces to navigate. The avatar starts on the left side, needing to traverse through the maze-like section while avoiding dead ends.\n- There are multiple coins and spaces where boxes can be manipulated around the holes without falling in.\n- Utilize the space effectively; since walls are present, think about how to funnel the piranha away from valuable areas.\n\nBy utilizing the given mechanics and understanding the layout, the player can develop a strong strategy to achieve the objectives while avoiding defeat.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> a\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> e\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",
