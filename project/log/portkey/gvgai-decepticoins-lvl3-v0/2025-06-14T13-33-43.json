The presence of an avatar that interacts with the environment, enemies (like the piranha), and various objects (like boxes and switches) emphasizes strategic decision-making and problem-solving.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game consists of various sprites such as `floor`, `hole`, `box`, `wall`, `coin`, `switch`, `moving`, `avatar`, and `piranha`, each with specific attributes and behaviors.\n2. **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can move and interact with other sprites:\n   - **Collisions:** Interacting with certain objects leads to different outcomes (e.g., boxes bounce the avatar forward, while colliding with piranhas leads to the avatar being killed).\n   - **Collecting Items:** The avatar can collect coins for scoring and interact with switches that spawn walls.\n3. **Chasing Enemies:** The piranha sprite is a chasing enemy that can potentially kill the avatar, introducing a need for evasion tactics.\n4. **Death and Score Management:** The game features consequences like death (losing the avatar) when interacting with certain enemies, while scoring is increased by collecting coins or causing a box to fall into a hole.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to maneuver the avatar to collect all the boxes and effectively use them to interact with other sprites to complete the level.\n- The game must be completed without losing all avatars (as indicated by the term \u201cSpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False\u201d), thus avoiding hazards like the piranha.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Condition:** The player wins by collecting all the boxes (as indicated by \u201cSpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True\u201d).\n- **Losing Condition:** The player loses if the count of avatars (SpritetCounter stype=avatar) reaches zero, meaning the player gets killed by the piranha or other lethal interactions.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management:** Carefully manage the positioning of the boxes to create paths and avoid placing them in holes where they would lead to a loss.\n2. **Evasion Tactics:** Stay alert to the movement of the piranha and use walls and other sprites to block it, ensuring your avatar remains safe while strategizing on the next move.\n3. **Sequential Plan:** Collect coins and interact wisely with switches to spawn walls at appropriate times, which might help in both blocking the piranha and creating routes for collecting boxes.\n4. **Exploration:** Take time to explore the map thoroughly, ensuring that you understand the layout of walls, switches, and all available pathways to maximize your chances of success.\n5. **Puzzles and Timing:** Timing is crucial when interacting with moving elements and selecting the right moment to push boxes or avoid the piranha. Consider using the environment to your advantage by moving strategically.\n\nUsing these strategies, players will have a better chance of overcoming the challenges posed by the game, successfully collecting all boxes, and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> a\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> e\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",

Although moving down leads to an immediate danger, I need to act to avoid being trapped in my current position and see what happens after moving down.\n\n### Action Decision\nI will take the action to move down. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move allows me to seek a way out and potentially reposition myself to either evade the piranha or explore other routes. My expectation is to observe how the piranha reacts and if a safe maneuver is still possible after this action.",
