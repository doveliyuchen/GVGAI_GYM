This genre typically involves navigating through levels, solving spatial puzzles, and avoiding or overcoming enemies.\n\n**2. Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - **Floor:** Acts as the ground the player can walk on but is immovable.\n  - **Hole:** A hazard that causes the player to lose a life or score if interacted with.\n  - **Box:** A passive object that can be manipulated but cannot be moved permanently. The 'shrinkfactor' indicates that these may change size in mechanics.\n  - **Wall:** Impassable barriers that block movement.\n  - **Coin:** Points collectible when collected by the avatar.\n  - **Switch:** Used to create new barriers in the game.\n  - **Moving Enemy (Piranha):** A chaser that actively pursues the player.\n  - **Avatar:** The main character, which can move and interact with other sprites.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The player can interact with the piranha, boxes, holes, coins, and switches, affecting their position or the game state.\n  - The player loses upon interaction with the piranha or falling into a hole.\n  - Boxes can bounce the player forward, and coins grant points.\n  - The switch can generate walls or may also be a hazard.\n\n**3. Objective:**\nThe player must navigate through the level, collect coins, and avoid hazards while managing the game-puzzle elements (like boxes and switches) to eventually eliminate all boxes to win (indicated by SpriteCounter for boxes reaching zero).\n\n**4. Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins when there are no boxes left in the level.\n- The player loses if the avatar is defeated or killed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaching zero).\n\n**5. Overall Strategy:**\n- **Movement and Positioning:** Carefully navigate the level to avoid the piranha, as it will chase the avatar. Make use of walls and safe zones to regroup and assess the environment.\n- **Box Management:** Utilize boxes to bounce forward potentially towards coins or safely navigate areas. Make strategic decisions about box placement\u2014move them into holes when needed to eliminate them.\n- **Collection:** Prioritize collecting coins to increase score, although this can risk interaction with the piranha. Weigh the risks versus benefits.\n- **Switch Usage:** Utilize switches to create walls that may block or deter the piranha, giving more time to navigate or collect coins.\n- **Avoid Hazards:** Avoid falling into holes, and manage interactions carefully to decrease the risk of losing lives.\n\nIn summary, the key to success in this game is careful management of movement and interactions, leveraging the game's mechanics of bouncing boxes, collecting coins, and using switches wisely to outmaneuver hazards while working toward the goal of eliminating all boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> a\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",

Since moving left isn\u2019t an option due to the wall, my only safe move is upwards.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to move away from the piranha and into a safe position.
