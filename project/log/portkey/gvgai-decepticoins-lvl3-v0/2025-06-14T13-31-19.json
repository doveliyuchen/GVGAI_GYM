Players control an avatar and interact with various elements in a two-dimensional space to achieve objectives, overcoming obstacles using logic and strategic movement.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites (Objects)**: The game contains several types of sprites which include:\n  - **Immovable Entities**: Such as `floor`, `hole`, `wall`, `coin`, and `switch`, representing fixed elements in the environment.\n  - **Passive Entity**: `box` can be moved by the player (avatar).\n  - **Moving Entity**: `piranha`, which chases the avatar and is lethal upon contact.\n  - **Moving Avatar**: Represents the player-controlled character.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can collect coins and can be harmed by the moving piranha.\n  - The box can knock the avatar forward and may interact with other sprites, including walls and holes.\n  - Switches can alter the environment by spawning walls.\n\n#### Objectives:\n- **Primary Objective**: The goal of the game is to ensure that all boxes are removed from the level, signified by achieving a condition where the `SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0` leads to a win.\n- **Secondary Objectives**: Collecting coins is also beneficial as it contributes to the player's score.\n- Surviving against the piranha is crucial, as contact with it results in death for the avatar.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes must be eliminated from the level. This is achieved through the avatar's interactions and strategic movements.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar loses all its lives (SpriteCounter limit=0), the game results in loss.\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Movement and Positioning**: Carefully navigate the level while avoiding direct paths of the piranha. Use the edges and walls for cover whenever possible. \n2. **Box Management**: Move boxes to eliminate them by dropping them into holes. Each box that falls into a hole awards a point.\n3. **Coin Collection**: Prioritize collecting coins when in safe positions to increase your score, but do not jeopardize your avatar's safety.\n4. **Switch Utilization**: Utilize switches to spawn walls, strategically blocking the piranha's path or creating pathways to reach other areas of the level.\n5. **Planning**: Consider movements ahead to avoid being boxed in by the walls or piranha. Timing will be key in your escapes and movements.\n6. **Experimentation**: If stuck, try moving boxes in different sequences or paths to observe how interactions change the level state.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics at play, a player can effectively navigate through the level, eliminate boxes, collect coins, and avoid the dangerous piranha to claim victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> a\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> e\nrow=9, col=2 -> e\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",
