Players control an avatar in a 2D environment, solving puzzles and navigating obstacles to achieve a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Movement**: The player controls an avatar ('knight') that can move around the grid-based layout. The positioning is key as the avatar interacts with other sprites.\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites are present\u2014walls, coins, boxes, holes, and a piranha. Each has distinct properties and interactions:\n  - **Walls**: Impassable barriers.\n  - **Boxes**: Can be moved by the player and interact with walls and other sprites.\n  - **Coins**: Collectible items that increase the score upon interaction.\n  - **Piranha**: A chasing enemy that causes a game-over if it touches the avatar.\n  - **Switch**: Can transform into a wall when activated and plays a role in puzzle-solving.\n\n#### Objectives:\nThe primary objectives of the game are:\n1. **Collect boxes**: The goal is to remove all boxes from the play area.\n2. **Score collection**: Collect coins to increase the score.\n3. **Avoid hazards**: Dodge the piranha to survive.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if all boxes have been removed from the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed by the piranha.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Planning Moves**: Identify potential moves in advance. Position the avatar to maximize efficient collection and movement of boxes while ensuring safety from the piranha.\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Boxes can be a means to block the piranha or can be used to knock them into holes to clear them and earn points.\n3. **Coin Collection**: Focus on collecting coins as you progress; while they may not be essential for winning, they add to your score and can reflect skill.\n4. **Avoiding the Piranha**: Keep a good distance from the piranha. Use walls and boxes as shields and strategize the path so that there are always escape routes when the piranha is close.\n5. **Switch Management**: Manage the switches carefully. They can change the layout (by spawning a wall), so activating them transforms the level and can both help and hinder your progress.\n6. **Analyze Level Layout**: Pay close attention to the arrangement of walls, holes, and other sprites. Every detail can impact your strategy.\n\nBy mastering the mechanics and staying vigilant about threats, players can successfully navigate through levels, defeat challenges, and empty the board of boxes while collecting as many coins as possible.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> a\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> e\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> e\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> @\nrow=9, col=8 -> 0\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> w\nrow=10, col=2 -> w\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> w\nrow=10, col=6 -> w\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> w\nrow=10, col=9 -> w",

    "content": "To assess the current state of the game, we observe the position of the avatar ('a') at (8, 1) and the presence of two piranhas ('e') at (9, 1) and (9, 5), along with several other objects including boxes ('1'), coins ('#'), and walls ('w'). The objective is to collect the boxes and coins while avoiding the piranhas.\n\nGiven that there's no immediate need to collect a box from the current position and there\u2019s only one box visible at (9, 7) directly below the piranha at (9, 5), it\u2019s crucial to ensure safety and strategize for moving downwards.\n\nThe avatar can move one space left (to (8, 0)), but that will be blocked (it\u2019s a wall 'w'). \n\nTherefore, I will attempt to move **down** to position (9, 1), however, doing so will lead me directly into the piranha.\n\nThe safest approach would be to stay where I am and not take any action that would lead me into danger. \n\n``` Action: 0 ```\nThis action allows me to reassess my situation without passing into danger and prepare for a better strategic movement on the next turn.",
