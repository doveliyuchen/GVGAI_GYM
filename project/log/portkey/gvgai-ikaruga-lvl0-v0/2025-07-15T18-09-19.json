    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here is an analysis of the game, including its genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a mix of **strategy** and **shooter**, possibly with elements of **tower defense** or **arena survival**, where players control an avatar to fend off waves of enemies and utilize various projectiles and mechanisms to do so.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Combat**:\n   - The player's **avatar** can interact with various other sprites including aliens, changers, and bullets.\n   - Actions include **killing other sprites**, transforming one sprite type into another, and gaining score based on interactions.\n   - **Alien sprites** drop bombs and are grouped into different types (black and white), which have varying interactions based on the player's bullets (also color-coded).\n\n2. **Weapons and Projectiles**:\n   - Players can utilize **bullets** and **missiles**. Different colors signify different types of ammo with unique interactions.\n   - **Bombs** and **changers** have cooldowns which adds a strategic timing element to their use.\n\n3. **Portals**:\n   - The presence of **portals** that spawn aliens may indicate a spawning mechanic, where players need to manage incoming threats effectively.\n\n4. **Interaction Rules**:\n   - Various interactions lead to different outcomes: killing enemies, transforming sprites, or causing score change based on the player\u2019s actions.\n  \n### Objective:\nThe main objective seems to be to survive while managing and defeating alien sprites that spawn from portals (while keeping the count of these sprites at bay). \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The player wins if all alien sprites are eliminated (via the condition that a counter of both ports and aliens reaches zero).\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar sprite count goes down to zero, indicating defeat.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Direct Combat**: Since interacting too closely with aliens can negatively impact your score or take out your avatar, keeping a distance and using projectiles effectively would be wise.\n\n2. **Utilize Portals**: Monitor portals; eliminating them swiftly can prevent new enemies from spawning, easing the pressure on the player.\n\n3. **Manage Cooldowns**: Be aware of the cooldowns for bombs and changers; using them at the optimal time can turn the battle in your favor. Planning attacks during cooldowns can also prevent being overwhelmed.\n\n4. **Color Coordination**: Use whiteAvatar and blackAvatar strategically. Transformations can be essential for dealing with the respective enemies they correspond to effectively.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: Keep track of your remaining sprites, weapons, and score. Avoid unnecessary combat that drains your resources.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies and being proactive rather than reactive, players can significantly enhance their chances of success in this game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwall background -> 'o'\nwhitePortal1 background -> 'q'\nblackPortal1 background -> 'w'\nwhitePortal2 background -> 'e'\nblackPortal2 background -> 'r'\nwhiteAvatar background -> 'A'\nwChangerPortal background -> 'z'\nbChangerPortal background -> 'x'\nbackground -> '.'\nblackAlien -> '@'\nblackChanger -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nwhiteAlien -> '%'\nwhiteAvatar -> '&'\nwhiteChanger -> '*'\nwhiteAvatar whiteBullet -> 'b'\nwhiteBullet -> 'c'\nblackAlien bomb -> 'd'\nbomb -> 'f'\nwhiteBullet whiteChanger -> 'g'\nblackAlien whiteBullet -> 'h'\nbomb whiteAlien -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> @\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> @\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> @\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> @\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> %\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> %\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> %\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> %\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> @\nrow=9, col=3 -> %\nrow=9, col=4 -> @\nrow=9, col=5 -> %\nrow=9, col=6 -> @\nrow=9, col=7 -> %\nrow=9, col=8 -> @\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> .\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> .\nrow=11, col=5 -> .\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> .\nrow=13, col=2 -> .\nrow=13, col=3 -> .\nrow=13, col=4 -> .\nrow=13, col=5 -> .\nrow=13, col=6 -> .\nrow=13, col=7 -> .\nrow=13, col=8 -> .\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=14, col=0 -> $\nrow=14, col=1 -> .\nrow=14, col=2 -> .\nrow=14, col=3 -> .\nrow=14, col=4 -> .\nrow=14, col=5 -> .\nrow=14, col=6 -> .\nrow=14, col=7 -> .\nrow=14, col=8 -> .\nrow=14, col=9 -> $\nrow=15, col=0 -> $\nrow=15, col=1 -> .\nrow=15, col=2 -> .\nrow=15, col=3 -> .\nrow=15, col=4 -> .\nrow=15, col=5 -> .\nrow=15, col=6 -> .\nrow=15, col=7 -> .\nrow=15, col=8 -> .\nrow=15, col=9 -> $\nrow=16, col=0 -> $\nrow=16, col=1 -> .\nrow=16, col=2 -> .\nrow=16, col=3 -> .\nrow=16, col=4 -> .\nrow=16, col=5 -> .\nrow=16, col=6 -> .\nrow=16, col=7 -> .\nrow=16, col=8 -> .\nrow=16, col=9 -> $\nrow=17, col=0 -> $\nrow=17, col=1 -> c\nrow=17, col=2 -> @\nrow=17, col=3 -> .\nrow=17, col=4 -> @\nrow=17, col=5 -> %\nrow=17, col=6 -> @\nrow=17, col=7 -> %\nrow=17, col=8 -> @\nrow=17, col=9 -> $\nrow=18, col=0 -> $\nrow=18, col=1 -> &\nrow=18, col=2 -> @\nrow=18, col=3 -> .\nrow=18, col=4 -> @\nrow=18, col=5 -> %\nrow=18, col=6 -> @\nrow=18, col=7 -> %\nrow=18, col=8 -> @\nrow=18, col=9 -> $",
