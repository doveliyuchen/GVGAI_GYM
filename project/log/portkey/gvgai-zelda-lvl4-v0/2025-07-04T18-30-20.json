    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, we can analyze the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategies as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fit into the **action-adventure** or **puzzle-platformer** genres. Players control an avatar with the ability to shoot and interact with various objects (like keys and enemies) as they navigate through the level.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game utilizes various sprite types:\n   - **Avatar**: The player character that can shoot and interact.\n   - **Goals and Keys**: Players need to collect keys to unlock goals.\n   - **Enemies**: Different types of monsters that can harm the player or be defeated for points.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Players can only progress through the 'goal' if they possess the 'key'.\n   - Attacking enemies can yield points, but contact with enemies without a weapon results in losing points.\n   - Collecting a key transforms the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey', indicating that the player is now able to interact with the goal.\n\n3. **Walls and Obstacles**: The layout includes immovable walls that create barriers throughout the level.\n\n### Game Objectives\n- **Primary Objective**: The main goal is to reach and interact with the 'goal' sprite after obtaining a 'key'.\n- **Secondary Objective**: Players can gain additional points by defeating enemies.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the player successfully interacts with the 'goal' while holding the 'key', indicated by the sprite counter for 'goal' reaching the required number.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the player (avatar) is defeated, as indicated by the sprite counter for 'avatar'.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout, including walls and enemy positions. Plan routes that avoid direct contact with enemies when possible.\n\n2. **Collect Keys**: Always seek out keys first to enable goal interaction. Use the transformation mechanic effectively; collect the key to advance towards the goal.\n\n3. **Engage Enemies Wisely**: Use the sword to defeat enemies for points, but ensure to avoid unnecessary collisions. Prioritize which enemies to engage based on cooldowns and the player's health/status.\n\n4. **Work Your Way to the Goal**: Navigate towards the 'goal' only after securing the key, ensuring that you\u2019re in a safe position to do so (i.e., free from enemy attacks).\n\n5. **Scoring**: While achieving the primary objective is essential, consider engaging with enemies for additional score bonuses, which could provide benefits if there's a scoring or leaderboard component.\n\n6. **Avoiding Negative Interactions**: Be mindful of the interactions that result in negative score changes (avatar hitting an enemy). Use your sword judiciously to maintain a favorable score.\n\nBy effectively utilizing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of completing the game and accumulating high scores along the way.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nkey monsterQuick -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nsword -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To determine the best action from the current state, let's analyze the important elements surrounding the avatar as well as our overall objective:\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar's surroundings are as follows:\n  - **Location**: Row 7, Column 4 is marked as '&', indicating the avatar is in the 'nokey' state.\n  - **Nearby Items**:\n    - Row 7, Column 6 has a key ('#'), which the avatar needs to collect in order to transition from 'nokey' to a state where it can interact with the goal ('@') found in Row 1, Column 10.\n    - There is a quick monster ('%') in Row 7, Column 3, which may present a risk if the avatar engages without strategy.\n\n### Directed Actions:\n- The action to collect the key at Row 7, Column 6 is **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**, as it would move the avatar one cell to the right onto the key ('#') from its current spot.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\nCollecting the key is absolutely aligned with the objective of efficiently reaching and interacting with the goal. Since the avatar has not moved from the last state, making a right action to collect the key ensures that we break the current inactivity and continue progressing towards the goal.\n\nGiven these considerations, the action to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nBy moving right, I expect to collect the key and enable interaction with the goal in future moves.",
