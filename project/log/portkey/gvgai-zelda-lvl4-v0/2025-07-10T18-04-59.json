    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThis game appears to fall into the **action-adventure** or **quest** genre, where players navigate a maze-like structure, collect items, and defeat enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - Various sprites represent the player (avatar), objectives (goal, key), obstacles (walls, movable walls), enemies (different monsters), and items (sword).\n   - The avatar can interact with keys, enemies, and goals in specific ways that affect gameplay.\n\n2. **Movement**: \n   - Players navigate through a grid-based layout, moving around walls and obstacles to reach objectives.\n\n3. **Combat**: \n   - The player uses a sword to engage enemies. The outcome of these engagements can lead to scoring opportunities or loss of life.\n\n4. **Item Collection**: \n   - Keys are essential for enabling access to the goal. Collecting the key transforms the player's state, allowing access to the goal.\n\n5. **Random NPCs**: \n   - Different types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) introduce varying combat dynamics due to their different speeds and cooldowns.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect the key and then reach the goal successfully while managing health against enemies. Success means defeating enemies and optimizing movement to navigate the level and avoid being killed.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when they reach the goal while holding the key (goal with key).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy (avatar enemy interaction results in -1 score).\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: \n   - Move carefully through the level to avoid unnecessary encounters with enemies at lower health. \n\n2. **Key Priority**: \n   - Focus on obtaining the key (Transforming from nokey to withkey) as soon as possible to enable access to the goal.\n\n3. **Combat Efficiency**: \n   - Utilize the sword effectively against enemies; aim to defeat them for additional score. Prioritize quick monsters first as they pose a greater threat due to faster engagement times.\n\n4. **Movement**: \n   - Practice strategic movement that allows the avatar to backtrack to safety if encountering a formidable enemy. Utilize the 'stepBack' interaction on walls or when meeting nokey to evaluate positions.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: \n   - Conserve health as much as possible, avoiding fights if the avatar\u2019s health is low, especially encountering the enemy type which is engaging.\n\n6. **Level Layout Familiarity**: \n   - Memorizing the layout will help in quickly navigating to avoid encounters and efficiently reach the key and then the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of winning while minimizing risks in encounters with enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\ngoal monsterQuick -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\nkey monsterNormal -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

Here's a summary based on the map layout:\n\n- The avatar is located at a position that has not been explicitly provided in the current state. However, based on the provided map, I can see that there are various entities to consider, such as walls (w), paths (.), a goal (g), a key (#), and enemies (monsters).\n\n- The goal (symbolized by '@') is located at (1, 10), while the key (symbolized by '#') is at (7, 6). \n\n- There are walls surrounding these locations, creating specific routes.\n\nSince the immediate goal is to collect the key and thereafter reach the goal, I should identify the best route to navigate through the open spaces to reach the key first.\n\nGiven the location of the key (7, 6) and considering the likely start position of the avatar, the next step would likely involve moving towards an open space that leads downwards where the key resides.\n\nLet\u2019s choose to move downwards (ACTION_DOWN) since the key is located lower on the map and progressively navigate toward the key.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this move will help position the avatar closer to the key while still avoiding the walls.",
