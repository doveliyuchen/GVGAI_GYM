This transformation is essential since interacting with the door (the goal) while \u201cnokey\u201d simply results in being pushed back.\n\u2003\u2013 The door (goal sprite) will \u201cclose\u201d or be removed (and you win) when approached with the key (i.e., when you are in the \u201cwithkey\u201d state).\n\u2003\u2013 You have a sword ability available to shoot a \u201csword\u201d sprite. This attack mechanic lets you kill enemy sprites (as long as they\u2019re hit with the sword).\n\u2003\u2013 There are several enemy types (monsterQuick, monsterNormal, monsterSlow) with different movement speeds that wander around, creating threats you need to avoid.\n\u2003\u2013 Collisions with enemies are dangerous: if an enemy touches your avatar, it results in the avatar being killed (and a negative score change).\n\n\u2022 Objectives and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The overall goal is to find and collect the key (which transforms your state) and then reach the door. When you interact with the door while \u201cwithkey,\u201d the door is removed and you win the level.\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is killed (for example, by colliding with an enemy).\n\n\u2022 Basic Strategy:\n\u20031. Navigate the Maze: Explore the level carefully to locate the key. The level layout contains walls and obstacles that create a maze-like environment, so plan your route.\n\u20032. Secure the Key Early: Since interacting with the door in the \u201cnokey\u201d state won\u2019t work (the door will push you back), your first priority should be to pick up the key; that is when your state changes to \u201cwithkey.\u201d\n\u20033. Manage Enemies: Be mindful of the roaming enemies. Avoid direct contact since an enemy collision kills your avatar. However, if you\u2019re comfortable with the stun-shoot mechanic, use your sword to clear enemies. Remember that the sword is a flickering, oriented projectile with a limited duration, so timing and positioning are important.\n\u20034. Proceed to the Door: Once you have the key (i.e., after transforming into \u201cwithkey\u201d), head towards the door. Unlike the \u201cnokey\u201d state, approaching the door while \u201cwithkey\u201d triggers the interaction that wins the game.\n\u20035. Use Obstacles to Your Advantage: The maze layout and walls can sometimes be used to slow down or block enemies as you negotiate a path, so always be aware of your surroundings.\n\u20036. Stay Alert: Your score is affected by interactions (point gains for successful hits, and negative for getting hit by enemies), so maintain careful control to keep your avatar alive.\n\nIn summary, this game challenges you to navigate a maze, transform your character by picking up a key, and safely reach the door while managing roaming enemies with smart use of your sword. Focus on careful exploration, precise timing in combat, and a steady route planning to secure the win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwithkey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
