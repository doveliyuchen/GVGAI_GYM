    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:**  Looks like a single-screen puzzle game with action elements, possibly roguelike-ish due to resource management (limited sword use).\n\n**Objective:**  Get the avatar ('A') to the green door ('g').\n\n**Win Condition:**  Eliminate all of the 'goal' sprites.\n\n**Loss Condition:**  The avatar ('A') is eliminated.\n\n**Sprites and Their Properties:**\n\n*   **Avatar ('A'):**  The player character. Can shoot swords. Starts as 'nokey'.\n*   **Goal ('g'):** The exit, requires a key to open.\n*   **Key ('+'):**  Pick this up to transform the avatar into the 'withkey' type.\n*   **Enemy ('1','2'):** Monsters that move randomly.  Different types have different speeds and presumably health.\n*   **Sword:**  Limited-use projectile fired by the avatar.\n*   **Wall ('w'):** Impassable obstacle.\n*   **Movable:** an impassable object that the Avatar can push.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:**  Implied, but the avatar can move.\n*   **Shooting:**  Avatar shoots swords, likely in cardinal directions. The 'limit=5' on the sword suggests the player can only fire five shots.\n*   **Key Collection:**  The player must pick up the key to open the door.\n*   **Enemy Combat:**  The player must shoot enemies with swords to clear a path or survive.  Enemies hurt the avatar.\n*   **Limited Resources:** The player is only able to make five sword attacks\n\n**Key Interactions:**\n\n*   Avatar cannot open the goal without a key.\n*   Picking up a key transforms the avatar into the 'withkey' type.\n*   Opening the goal eliminates the goal sprite and awards a point.\n*   Swords kill enemies.\n*   Enemies hurt the avatar.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key First:**  Prioritize getting the key as quickly and safely as possible.\n2.  **Conserve Swords:**  With a limited number of shots, make each one count. Try to line up shots to hit multiple enemies.\n3.  **Pathfinding:** Plan your path to avoid unnecessary enemy encounters. Use walls and movable blocks to your advantage.\n4.  **Enemy Prioritization:** Focus on eliminating the most immediate threats.\n5.  **Risk Assessment:** Understand that killing an enemy is worth +2, but getting hit is -1. Weigh the risks of combat versus the rewards.\n\n**In summary:** The game requires careful planning, efficient use of limited resources, and strategic combat to navigate a maze, collect a key, and reach the exit while avoiding or eliminating enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nkey monsterQuick -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
