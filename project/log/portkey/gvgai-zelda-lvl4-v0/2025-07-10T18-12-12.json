    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:**  Looks like a top-down, single-screen, puzzle-action game, possibly with rogue-like elements due to the use of \"RandomNPC.\"\n\n**Objective:**  The primary goal is to get the avatar to open the green \"goal\" (door) and clear the level. This is done by finding a key.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:**  The player controls the \"avatar\" (swordman).\n*   **Shooting:** The player can shoot a \"sword\" projectile.\n*   **Key/Door Puzzle:**  The avatar needs to pick up a key (\"key\") to open the \"goal\" (door). Picking up the key transforms the avatar's appearance.\n*   **Enemies:** There are multiple types of enemies (\"monsterQuick\", \"monsterNormal\", \"monsterSlow\") that move randomly.\n*   **Combat:** The player can defeat enemies by shooting them with the \"sword\".\n*   **Immovable objects:** Some objects, such as walls, cannot be passed through.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   Destroy all the goal sprites on the level\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   The avatar sprite is destroyed\n\n**Sprites**\n\n*   Walls: Impassable.\n*   Floor: The ground.\n*   Goal: The door to exit, requires a key.\n*   Key: Pick this up to be able to open the door.\n*   Sword: A projectile.\n*   Avatar: The player.\n*   nokey: The avatar without a key.\n*   withkey: The avatar with a key.\n*   Enemy: Different types of monsters.\n\n**Interactions:**\n\n*   Avatar cannot walk through walls.\n*   Avatar cannot walk through a closed door.\n*   Avatar with a key opens the door.\n*   Sword kills enemies.\n*   Enemies cannot walk through each other.\n*   Enemies kill the player.\n*   Avatar picks up the key.\n\n**Level Layout:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `.`: Empty space\n*   `g`: Goal\n*   `A`: Avatar start\n*   `+`: Key\n*   `1`, `2`: Enemies\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Key First:** The immediate priority is always to locate and pick up the key. Without it, you can't win.\n2.  **Enemy Avoidance/Prioritization:** Be mindful of the enemy types. Faster enemies might require more immediate attention.\n3.  **Strategic Shooting:** Use the \"sword\" projectile carefully.  Given the limited uses and possible cooldown, don't waste shots.\n4.  **Path Planning:** The levels are likely designed with some level of puzzle element.\n5.  **Don't Die:** Avoid enemies. The game is lost if the player gets killed.\n\nIn summary, this seems like a game where you need to navigate a maze-like level, carefully manage limited combat resources, and solve a simple key-and-door puzzle while avoiding enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nkey monsterQuick -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
