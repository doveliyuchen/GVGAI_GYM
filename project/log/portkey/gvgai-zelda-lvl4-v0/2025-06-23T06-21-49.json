Players navigate through a level collecting items (such as keys) while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites, including:\n  - **Player sprites:** represented as the 'avatar' can interact with keys and doors.\n  - **Goal sprite:** a **goal** sprite (green door) that can only be accessed if the avatar has a key.\n  - **Key sprite:** allows the avatar to unlock the goal.\n  - **Enemies:** Different types of enemies (like bat, spider, and scorpion) that can harm the avatar but can also be defeated using the sword.\n  - **Movable wall:** Players must navigate around or manipulate walls that can block paths.\n  \n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar automatically transforms when it collects a key (changing from 'nokey' to 'withkey').\n  - The avatar can defeat enemies with the sword, gaining score points in the process.\n  - Players must be careful to avoid enemies, as being touched by an enemy results in a loss of points.\n  \n**Objective:**\n- The main objective is to reach the goal (green door) after collecting a key. You must maintain the avatar's health to avoid losing points and ultimately try to maximize score through defeating enemies.\n  \n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal while holding a key (as indicated by the sprite counter for the goal).\n- The game is lost when the avatar is eliminated (encounters an enemy without a key).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Explore Carefully:** \n   - Start by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout. Note where keys are located and any potential threats (enemies).\n  \n2. **Defeat or Avoid Enemies:** \n   - Engage with enemies strategically. Use your sword to defeat them when possible to increase your score.\n   - If outnumbered or facing a stronger enemy, consider avoiding them to preserve your avatar's health.\n\n3. **Prioritize Key Acquisition:**\n   - Aim to collect the key before reaching the goal. Ensure you always approach the area where the key is located cautiously, especially if it's near enemies.\n  \n4. **Maintain Health:**\n   - Keep an eye on your avatar\u2019s state. Avoid unnecessary risks that may lead to losing health points with enemies or by bumping into walls.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - After mapping out enemy locations and the goal, plan a route that allows you to collect the key, avoid enemies, and reach the goal efficiently.\n\n6. **Utilize Movement Skills:**\n   - Make use of the sprite mechanics, like stepping back from unblockable wall collisions and maintaining a strategic distance from aggressive enemies.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies, you can effectively navigate through the game, maximize your score, and achieve victory by reaching the goal after acquiring the key.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nkey monsterQuick -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The important entities discovered are:\n\n- The goal (@) is located at (1, 10).\n- There is a key (*) at (7, 6).\n- There is an enemy ($) located at (5, 8) and another at (7, 3).\n- My avatar currently occupies a nokey position (&) at (7, 4).\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Since my current position is near the key, the first objective is to move towards it in order to collect it. I should move left to (7, 3), which is occupied by an enemy but if I proceed carefully, I can navigate the next turn to collect the key from (7, 6) without attempting to engage with the enemy yet.\n\n### Expected Move:\nMoving left will allow me to assess the situation as I collect the key on the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left towards the enemy gives me a strategic positioning to collect the key next. I expect that upon reaching (7, 3), I will then plan to collect the key on the following move.",
