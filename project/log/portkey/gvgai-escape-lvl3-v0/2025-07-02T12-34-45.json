    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThe game can be categorized as a puzzle game, specifically a grid-based logic or platform puzzle, where players navigate through a maze-like environment to reach an objective while managing obstacles.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** Represents the main area where the avatar can move.\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character that can be moved through the level.\n   - **Boxes:** Objects that can be interacted with, either by pushing or bouncing off.\n   - **Exit:** A target point for the avatar to reach, denoted by a green door.\n   - **Holes:** Dangerous areas that can lead to the avatar's demise if interacted with.\n   - **Walls:** Barriers that cannot be passed through.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar cannot walk through walls and will be forced to step back.\n   - When the avatar collides with a box, it bounces back.\n   - Boxes can be moved to block entrances or down holes.\n   - Interaction with holes leads to a loss of points or an end state for the sprite.\n   - Reaching the exit results in victory and a point gain.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends in defeat if the avatar is lost (0 remaining).\n   - Victory is achieved when the avatar exits through the green door.\n   - There is also a time limit of 1000 units, suggesting that players must act swiftly.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the exit while avoiding traps (the holes) and managing the boxes without allowing the avatar to be lost.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** Achieved by successfully reaching the exit sprite, resulting in a score increase.\n- **Loss:** Occurs if the avatar collides with a hole and is effectively removed from play, or if the timer runs out without reaching the exit.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Movements:**\n   - Examine the layout before moving to determine optimal paths towards the exit while avoiding immediate danger from holes and walls.\n\n2. **Box Manipulation:**\n   - Use the boxes wisely to block holes or create pathways towards the exit. Experiment with pushing them to see how they interact with the walls and exit.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes:**\n   - Always be mindful of your surroundings; always know where the holes are to avoid losing points and ending your game.\n\n4. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep track of the time limit; do not spend too long charting out moves. If you're stuck, consider an alternative route or plan a new strategy quickly.\n\n5. **Use Bouncing Wisely:**\n   - Take advantage of the bouncing interaction with boxes to create space or push the boxes into advantageous positions.\n\nBy proactively planning movements, carefully managing the boxes, and keeping a wary eye on both time and obstacles, players can navigate the puzzle effectively to achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

    "content": "The current state shows that the avatar (a) is located at (row 3, col 6), and the exit (#) is positioned at (row 7, col 11). From the layout, there are walls (%) surrounding the area, and some holes ($) present in various spots that I must avoid.\n\nGiven the objective is to reach the exit while navigating around boxes (@) and avoiding holes, focusing on moving the avatar towards the exit is crucial.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Analyze Current Position:** I am at (3, 6) and can navigate left (3, 5), right (3, 7), up (2, 6), or down (4, 6).\n2. **Identify Moves:** \n   - **Left (3, 5)**: This position is clear, but it doesn't take me closer to the exit.\n   - **Right (3, 7)**: This is a box (@), so moving here will cause a bounce back.\n   - **Up (2, 6)**: This position is clear.\n   - **Down (4, 6)**: This position is a hole ($), which is dangerous.\n\nBecause I cannot move down (4, 6) due to a hole, the only meaningful moves are left or up. However, left does not bring me any closer to the exit. So, I should go up to explore further toward the exit.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move allows me to explore an open path and reassess from (2, 6) for the next best steps towards the exit. I expect this aligns with the strategy of planning movements while avoiding immediate traps and making progress toward the exit.",
