The mechanics of moving an avatar (character) to interact with various blocks and obstacles, along with the goal of reaching an exit, align with common characteristics of puzzle platformers.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - Different types of sprites have specific roles:\n     - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player.\n     - **Wall**: Impassable barriers that the avatar cannot cross.\n     - **Box**: A movable object that the avatar can interact with.\n     - **Exit**: The goal of the level, represented by a green door.\n     - **Hole**: A trap that kills the avatar if interacted with.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar cannot move through walls and will step back if it tries.\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, suggesting a mechanic where the orientation and placement of boxes are crucial.\n   - Boxes can be used strategically, as they can affect both exits (through canceling moves) and holes (by being destroyed).\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends when the avatar is eliminated (losing condition) or when the exit is reached (winning condition).\n   - There is also a time limit that, if reached without completing the level, results in failure.\n\n### Objective:\nThe player\u2019s main objective is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the exit. This is done while avoiding losing interactions (holes) and managing the movement of boxes effectively.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- Win: The player wins by reaching the exit.\n- Loss: The player loses if the avatar is killed by a hole (direct interaction) or if the time limit runs out before reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Always visualize your next steps. Keep track of where the boxes are and how they can be used to maneuver towards the exit while avoiding holes.\n  \n2. **Utilize the Boxes**: Use boxes to block holes or create pathways. You may need to experiment with their positioning to solve the puzzle effectively.\n\n3. **Check Surroundings**: Before making a move, scan the area. Being aware of the walls and holes will prevent unnecessary losses.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time. Know when to move quickly and when to take a moment to strategize. \n\n5. **Experiment and Adjust**: Don\u2019t hesitate to reset your position or interactions, especially if the placement of boxes does not lead to a successful route toward the exit.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can navigate the level effectively and reach the exit while minimizing risk to their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

    "content": "In the current game state, the avatar is located at (row=3, col=6), and the exit is at (row=7, col=11).\n\nTo navigate towards the exit, the immediate step is to identify potential movements. The avatar can move left, right, up, or down, but must consider the walls and the holes in the surrounding area. \n\n### Current Position Analysis:\n- **Position (3, 6)**: \n  - Up (2, 6): This space is empty (`.`).\n  - Down (4, 6): This space has a box (`@`), which can be used later.\n  - Left (3, 5): This space is empty (`.`).\n  - Right (3, 7): This space is empty (`.`).\n\n### Actions:\nMoving up (to (2, 6)) or down (to (4, 6)) could be useful. Moving down may allow greater access to manipulative elements (the box), while moving up isolates the avatar from immediate hazards and opens up multiple paths.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven that I want to explore down (since it leads towards the box), I will move down to (4, 6).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should lead me right near the box, which may be helpful for later moves towards the exit. I expect to be able to manipulate the box and progress towards the exit based on my strategies of using boxes effectively.",
