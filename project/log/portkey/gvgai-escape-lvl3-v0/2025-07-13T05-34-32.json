Boxes can fill holes.\n*   **Exit:** Reaching the exit (cheese) wins the game (score +1).\n*   **Portals:** Holes are also 'portals', but without a paired destination, it just leads to death.\n*   **Limited Time:** There is a time limit.\n*   **Undoing:** If a box simultaneously touches a wall and an exit, everything is undone. This looks to be a specific condition to penalize the player, maybe used for levels with a trap.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary objective is to get the avatar to the exit ('cheese').\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   All exits are gone (meaning the avatar reached at least one exit).\n\n**Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   The avatar dies (falls into a hole).\n*   The time runs out.\n\n**Sprites Analysis:**\n\n*   `floor`: Background tile, does not affect the game.\n*   `avatar`: Player character, a rat.\n*   `box`: Pushable block that the avatar can move around.\n*   `exit`: The cheese/goal the avatar must reach.\n*   `hole`: A deadly trap and potential box disposal.\n*   `wall`: Impassable obstacles.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   `w` represents walls, `A` represents the avatar's starting position, `x` represents the exit, `h` represents holes, and `1` represents boxes.\n*   The level is a small, confined space.\n*   There are multiple boxes and holes.\n*   The exit is near a cluster of holes, suggesting that strategic box placement is important.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Survival:** Avoid falling into holes at all costs.\n2.  **Plan Box Movements:** Think several steps ahead before pushing boxes. It's easy to get them stuck.\n3.  **Use Holes Strategically:** Holes can be used to eliminate boxes that are blocking your path or to create a path to the exit.\n4.  **Time Management:** Be mindful of the time limit. Don't waste time on unnecessary moves.\n5.  **Be Aware of the \"Undo\" Condition:** Avoid pushing boxes into the corner where a wall and exit intersect.\n6.  **Solve backwards**: Sometimes it helps to solve the puzzle backwards in your head, starting from the goal and working backwards towards the start\n7.  **Look for Deadlocks:** Identify and avoid situations where a box becomes permanently stuck, preventing you from reaching the exit.\n\nIn essence, this game is a classic Sokoban-style puzzle with a few twists (holes and a time limit) that add to the challenge. Careful planning and precise execution are key to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> a\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
