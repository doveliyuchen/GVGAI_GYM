    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules and level layout provided, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fit within the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players must navigate a character (the avatar) through a grid-based environment, utilizing strategic movement and interactions with objects to reach the exit.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Serves as the base ground.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Box**: A passive object that can be used for specific interactions.\n   - **Exit**: The goal that the player needs to reach to win.\n   - **Hole**: An impassable area that can kill the avatar or boxes.\n   - **Wall**: An immovable barrier that players cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar will **step back** when hitting a wall.\n   - When the avatar collides with a box, it will **bounce forward**, which suggests that the box can be moved or utilized to trigger other mechanics.\n   - Interaction between the box and the exit leads to an undo action, which may indicate a puzzle element where positioning matters.\n   - The avatar can die if it enters a hole, leading to a score penalty.\n   - The goal is to reach the exit to gain points.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar is lost (SpriteCounter reaches zero).\n   - The game ends in a win when the exit is reached (exit SpriteCounter reaches zero).\n   - There is a time limit (1000 units) that can also result in a loss.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to guide the avatar to the exit door while managing interactions with boxes and avoiding holes. The player must utilize the bouncing mechanic effectively to navigate obstacles and solve puzzles that lead to the exit.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: Reach the exit before the timeout limit is reached.\n- **Loss**: The avatar runs out of lives, enters a hole, or the time limit is exceeded.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movement**: Before moving, evaluate the layout and plan a route to the exit. Pay attention to walls, as hitting them causes setbacks.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes**: Use the bouncing interactions effectively to move boxes into strategic positions to clear paths or interact with the exit.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious of holes, as entering one will result in losing points and potentially the game.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer; aim to complete the level as quickly as possible without rushing into mistakes.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**: Don't hesitate to experiment with different strategies, especially with the bouncing mechanics, to discover optimal paths and interactions.\n\nBy understanding and leveraging these mechanics and strategies, players can improve their chances of success within this puzzle/platforming game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

The avatar can interact with boxes to navigate the environment and ultimately reach the exit. \n\nFrom the avatar's current position, we can notice the following:\n- There are multiple boxes (`@`) in nearby positions, which could potentially be moved to create a pathway.\n- The exit is two rows down and five columns to the right from the avatar's position.\n- The immediate cells below (to the left and right) contain empty floor tiles, indicating a possible path for movement.\n\nGiven these observations, the best action to take next is to move down (to (4, 6)), which leads closer to the exit and allows for further options in the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down will help me progress towards the exit effectively, as it places me closer to the empty floor tiles below.",
