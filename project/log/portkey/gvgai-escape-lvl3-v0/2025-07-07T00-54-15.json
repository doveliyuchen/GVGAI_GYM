If you bump into one, you\u2019re forced back.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes (\u201cblock\u201d sprites) can be pushed around. When the avatar collides with a box, the box \u201cbounces\u201d forward.\n\u2003\u2013 There are holes dotted around the level. If your avatar goes into a hole, it dies (and you lose a point). If a box falls into a hole, it gets removed.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s an exit door (depicted as cheese with a green tint). When your avatar reaches it, the exit \u201cdies\u201d (is removed), awarding you a point and signaling that you\u2019ve completed the level.\n\u2003\u2013 An unusual rule involves the boxes meeting walls and the exit in a certain way (the \u201cbox wall exit box\u201d interaction). When that happens, the game \u201cundoes\u201d all moves. This appears to be a built-in mechanism to reset a mistaken or impossible progression of box movements.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your ultimate goal is to guide the avatar safely to the exit while avoiding holes.\n\u2003\u2013 If your avatar dies (for example, by falling into a hole) or if you run out of time (over 1000 turns), you lose.\n\u2003\u2013 Successfully reaching (and thereby \u201cusing up\u201d) the exit wins the level.\n\n\u2022 Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Plan your route carefully: Since walls block movement and holes are deadly, look over the level layout first. Identify which corridors are safe and which ones have hidden risks.\n\u20032. Manage the boxes: The boxes can change the maze\u2019s dynamics. Use them to clear or block paths if needed, but be wary\u2014they can also bounce unexpectedly. Avoid setups that might trigger the \u201cundo\u201d condition, as that will cancel your progress.\n\u20033. Keep an eye on your moves: Because of the reset rule linked to some box interactions, each move might have lasting consequences. Think a move ahead before pushing a box into a new position.\n\u20034. Move methodically: Every move counts due to the timeout limit. Assess what lies ahead and try to foresee any chain reactions (like boxes falling into holes or rebounding) that might block your path.\n\u20035. Aim for the exit: Ultimately, reach the exit by playing through the puzzle while keeping your avatar safe. Use boxes to open or secure the path if necessary, but prioritize a route that minimizes risk.\n\nIn short, this is a classic puzzle challenge with a twist. You must carefully navigate the maze, handle movable boxes wisely, and avoid deadly holes\u2014all while racing against the clock. The key to winning is to remain patient, plan every move, and be ready to reassess if you run into an unexpected chain reaction. Enjoy the mental workout!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> a\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
