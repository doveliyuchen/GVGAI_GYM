You\u2019re controlling an avatar (a rat) moving in a level filled with walls, boxes (blocks), holes, and an exit \u201cdoor.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Movement: Your avatar moves around on a grid. It can\u2019t go through walls \u2013 if you try, it simply gets pushed back.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes: There are boxes in the level. When your avatar bumps into one, it causes the box to \u201cbounce\u201d further. Boxes can also interact with other objects. Notably, if a box hits a wall or an exit in a certain way, all recent moves may be undone; this typically signals that you\u2019ve done something that isn\u2019t allowed.\n\u2003\u2013 Holes: Stepping on a hole is dangerous. If your avatar goes into one, it dies and you lose a point of score. Boxes that fall into a hole vanish.\n\u2003\u2013 Exit: The exit is marked by a green door (or in the level layout it\u2019s the \u201cx\u201d tile). When your avatar reaches the exit, a special interaction happens: the exit is removed (\u201ckilled\u201d) and you gain a score point. Removing the exit is your win condition.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Objective & Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your goal isn\u2019t to \u201cescape\u201d keeping your avatar alive \u2013 rather, you want to deliberately get your avatar to the exit. When the avatar touches the exit, it is removed, and that triggers the win condition.\n\u2003\u2013 However, if your avatar gets killed by falling into a hole (or if you run out of moves \u2013 there\u2019s a timeout limit), you lose.\n\u2003\u2013 Also note, if you lose your only avatar while still leaving the exit intact, that\u2019s a loss. So, you must carefully direct your avatar to the exit and avoid accidental falls into holes.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Plan Ahead in the Maze: Study the level\u2019s layout. The maze is filled with walls, boxes, and holes. Think about the order in which you need to move so that you don\u2019t end up in a dead\u2010end or fall into a hole.\n\u20032. Be Deliberate with Box Interactions: Since boxes interact with other objects (and even \u201cbounce\u201d on your avatar), you\u2019ll need to use them carefully. They might block your way or, if moved wrongly, could even force an undo of your moves if they hit walls or the exit improperly. Use them as tools to clear paths or to maybe cover harmful holes, but be cautious.\n\u20033. Avoid Holes: A misstep that puts you in a hole will kill your avatar and cost you, so move slowly and think before each step. Sometimes a box might disappear by falling into a hole \u2013 this might open up new paths or remove a dangerous obstacle.\n\u20034. Win by Hitting the Exit: Your target is to get your avatar to the exit square. Upon doing so, the exit \u201cdies\u201d and that triggers a win\u2014even though your avatar is taken out in the process. In short, you want to be careful until you\u2019re ready to \u201csacrifice\u201d your avatar correctly by stepping on the exit.\n\u20035. Watch the Move Limit: There\u2019s a timeout (1000 moves), so you need to be economical with your movements \u2013 overthinking each minute could get you into trouble if you waste too many moves.\n\u2003\nIn summary, this game is all about puzzling your way through a structured maze while managing movable boxes and avoiding deadly holes. Every move counts, and proper planning is key. Work out a step\u2010by\u2010step plan that moves you toward the exit without falling into traps, and use the boxes to help clear your path. Once you\u2019re confident, guide your avatar to the exit to secure the win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> @\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> a\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
