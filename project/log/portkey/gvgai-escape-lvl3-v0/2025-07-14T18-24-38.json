The main ingredients are:\n\n\u2022 The Avatar: You control a moving avatar that must navigate through the maze-like level.\n\u2022 Boxes: These are movable obstacles that you can push. When the avatar moves into a box, the box \u201cbounces forward\u201d one tile. However, if this push would force a box into a wall, another box, or even the exit (acting as a special kind of wall), the move is canceled (an \u201cundoAll\u201d is triggered), so you have to carefully consider where and how to push a box.\n\u2022 Walls: These are immovable barriers that stop movement.\n\u2022 Holes: Touching a hole is deadly for the avatar (and takes away points), while if a box falls into a hole, it is simply removed from the level.\n\u2022 Exit: The exit is the door you must reach. When the avatar touches the exit, it \u201ckills\u201d the exit sprite (removing it) which triggers the win condition, and it even rewards you with points.\n\nGame mechanics and rules include:\n\u2013 The avatar cannot pass through walls; when encountering one, it steps back.\n\u2013 If you try to push a box and it would land in an invalid spot (against a wall, another box, or the exit), then the entire move is undone.\n\u2013 Stepping into a hole kills your avatar (loss of life and score), while making it to the exit wins the level.\n\u2013 There is also a move limit (timeout after 1000 steps), so you need to be efficient.\n\nOverall Objective:\nGuide your avatar safely from its starting position to the exit door. Overcoming obstacles means working around or rearranging boxes, avoiding holes, and plotting a clear route toward the exit.\n\nGeneral Strategy:\n1. Survey the level layout carefully to find the clearest path from A (the avatar\u2019s starting point) to X (the exit).\n2. Plan how and when to push boxes. Since boxes only move if they can \u201cbounce forward\u201d unobstructed, think ahead about where the box will end up. Avoid pushing a box into a dead-end against a wall or into another box.\n3. Watch out for holes. You must maneuver around them \u2013 or if needed, you might purposely push a box into a hole to remove it (but only if that benefits your route), since a box falling into a hole is removed.\n4. Make each move count because every move counts toward the move limit, and a wrong push may result in an undo that forces you to rethink your route.\n5. Maintain control of your pace: use the undo feature (triggered automatically if a box bump is invalid) as a hint that the push you attempted wasn\u2019t legal, and re-plan accordingly.\n\nBy carefully planning your route, managing the movable boxes and dangerous holes, and using each move wisely, you can reach the exit to win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> a\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
