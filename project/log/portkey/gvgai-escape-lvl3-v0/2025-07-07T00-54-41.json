Additionally, the player must manage their score since falling into holes results in a score reduction.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the exit (SpriteCounter for exit reaches zero).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero) or if the game times out after 1000 moves.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore the Level**: Begin by carefully exploring the level layout to familiarize yourself with the position of walls, holes, boxes, and the exit.\n\n2. **Plan Movements**: Avoid unnecessary interactions with holes and plan the avatar's movements to avoid falling into them. Keep track of how many boxes there are and where they are positioned. \n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Utilize the boxes to create pathways or block holes if possible. Push them towards walls to navigate around tricky areas but be careful of where they end up.\n\n4. **Avoid Timeouts**: Be aware of the time limit. Make decisions quickly but judiciously to avoid reaching the timeout condition.\n\n5. **Score Management**: Aim to keep the avatar safe from holes to maintain your score. The goal is to reach the exit with the highest score possible, so think of ways to maneuver around without risk of damage.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: If a sequence of moves doesn\u2019t lead to success, consider experimenting with different approaches or paths. Understanding sprites' interactions may take multiple attempts.\n\nBy strategically planning movements and leveraging available sprites while being mindful of time and score, players can effectively navigate to the exit and win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> %\nrow=4, col=2 -> %\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
