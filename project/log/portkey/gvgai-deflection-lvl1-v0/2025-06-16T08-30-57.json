    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and game layout, here's a breakdown of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **strategy/puzzle** game with elements of **survival** and **resource management**. It incorporates space-themed sprites and an avatar, suggesting a setting centered around exploration and survival in a cosmic environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites represent the player's avatar, obstacles (like bombs), interactive elements (such as planets and a black hole), and turrets that can have random effects. \n2. **Health Points**: The player's avatar has health points, which can be affected by bombs or encounters with the nebula.\n3. **Transformations**: The avatar can interact with planets to gain health points or transform empty planets into busy ones, potentially representing resource gathering or territory control.\n4. **Black Hole Mechanic**: The black hole serves as a passive element that results in the avatar\u2019s defeat upon contact, but it also provides a score gain if avoided and outlasted.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objectives are:\n- **Survive**: Keep the avatar alive by managing health points.\n- **Transform Planets**: Successfully interact with planets to transform empty ones to busy ones to gain health or score.\n- **Avoid Hazards**: Navigate around bombs and the black hole to maintain health and avoid loss.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if there are no black hole sprites remaining.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game is lost if the avatar\u2019s health points reach zero or if the time limit is exceeded (1000 units).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**: Keep a close eye on the avatar's health points. Look for opportunities to interact with planets to gain health points, especially after engaging with damaging sprites (bombs, nebula).\n   \n2. **Movement and Positioning**: Move the avatar strategically to avoid bombs and black hole interactions. Use the \"a\" spaces (likely indicating accessible spaces) to your advantage and always have an exit plan if you accidentally move too close to danger.\n\n3. **Planet Management**: Focus on transforming empty planets into busy ones as a priority. This not only increases the interaction potential for recovery (adding health points) but may also open up other gameplay elements (like scoring).\n\n4. **Utilize Turrets Wisely**: The turrets have a probability of firing bombs. If the avatar can position itself correctly relative to the turrets and maintain a safe distance, it can capitalize on their cooldowns while managing other threats.\n\n5. **Mind the Clock**: Keep a watchful eye on the time limit as it serves as a de facto win condition together with the health points. Plan actions strategically to avoid rushing, which can lead to poor decisions.\n\nBy employing this strategy, players can more effectively navigate the challenges presented in this game while maximizing their chances of achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To take effective action, I'll need to know my current avatar position, the positions of the black hole, bombs, and planets, as well as any health status and turrets in the environment. If my position hasn't changed since the last action, I will analyze the game state to determine a new action based on the mechanics and strategy provided.\n\nSince I don't have the current state or position details, I will assume I need to move strategically to optimize health points and avoid hazards. \n\nGiven that I need to decide on an action without the specific information:\n\n1. If I'm near a bomb or an edge (risk of the black hole), I should move away from it (either ACTION_LEFT or ACTION_RIGHT if available).\n2. If there are empty planets around, I may want to navigate towards them to transform them.\n3. If I'm facing a threat and have not moved, I will change my facing direction first and then potentially move.\n\nWith no current state provided, I'll initiate an action to the left (if my current facing allows), as it is generally safe to explore and check for nearby interactable objects.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nI expect this action to give me a better assessment of my surroundings and potentially lead to gaining health points or avoiding risks.",
