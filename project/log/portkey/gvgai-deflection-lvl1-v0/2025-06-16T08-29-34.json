Players maneuver an avatar in a space environment, interacting with various sprites and managing resources for survival or victory.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites** are defined with specific characteristics: immovable backgrounds, avatars with health points, stationary turrets that can bomb the player, and mechanics involving planets and black holes.\n- **Avatar Controls**: The player controls an 'avatar' characterized by its speed, health, and ability to interact with other sprites. The avatar can align with empty planets to convert them into busy ones and gain health points.\n- **Interactivity**: \n  - The avatar loses health upon contact with the nebula or bombs.\n  - The black hole is lethal and will kill the avatar upon contact, but it also gives the player points if it manages to kill the avatar, suggesting a possible risk-reward mechanic.\n  - Interaction with planets will yield various outcomes, and the player can transform empty planets into busy ones for health recovery.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to manage the avatar's health while navigating through the level, interacting with planets, and avoiding attacks from turrets and bombs. Winning the game involves reaching a state where there are no black holes left (SpriteCounter for blackholes at limit=0) while ensuring the avatar survives (SpriteCounter for avatars at limit=0 means loss).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win** \n  - All black holes must be eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=blackhole limit=0).\n- **Loss**\n  - The avatar's health reaches zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n  - Time runs out (timeout limit=1000).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Manage Health Wisely**: Always be aware of your health points. Avoid contact with nebulae and bombs, as they will reduce health.\n  \n2. **Planet Utilization**: Use empty planets opportunistically. Align with them to transform them into busy planets to gain health whenever you need it. This can be crucial for sustaining your avatar throughout the game.\n\n3. **Avoid Turrets and Bombs**: Navigate cautiously around turrets that can drop bombs. Staying at a safe distance will minimize health loss.\n\n4. **Eliminate Black Holes**: Focus on finding a strategy to eliminate all black holes if they pose a threat. Since they kill the avatar instantly, staying away is essential until you can deal with them strategically.\n\n5. **Decision Making**: Every action counts. Decide between attacking the black holes or utilizing planets for health. Have a contingency plan based on your current health status.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Keep track of your time limit. If nearing time out, prioritize actions that lead to victory or health recovery.\n\n7. **Positioning**: Maintain a mobile and flexible stance, always ready to align with planets or evade turrets and bombs as new threats appear.\n\nBy strategically navigating the game space, managing health through planet interactions, and eliminating threats like black holes and turrets, players can increase their chances of success while mitigating risks.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To proceed with a strategy that aligns with the game's mechanics, I need to ensure that I am vigilant about my avatar's current position and actions. I will first assess the preceding state and examine if my avatar's position has changed. \n\nSince my previous action may have not yielded movement due to rotational mechanics, I will choose a direction based on the most recent information provided. However, I do not currently have that information available.\n\nI will begin by attempting to check if I can move upward, as this may lead me to a position where I can align with an empty planet or safely navigate around turrets.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should help me determine if I'm able to move and find a viable route for health management based on my strategic focus. I expect to assess my next move accordingly based on whether I successfully changed positions or not.",
