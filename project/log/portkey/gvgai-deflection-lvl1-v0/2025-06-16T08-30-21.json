    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a **2D action-adventure** or **survival game** set in a space environment, where players navigate their avatar (a spaceship) and interact with various sprites on the map.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player controls a spaceship with limited health points that can engage with different objects in the environment.\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Backgrounds like nebulae and planets create a visually immersive space environment.\n   - **Random Bombs**: Turrets can randomly emit bombs that the player must avoid, which adds an obstacle-based mechanic.\n\n2. **Health System**:\n   - The avatar has a health points system with a maximum limit. Interacting with certain objects can either damage or heal the avatar.\n   - The player can gain health points from busy planets but should be cautious of bombs and hazards.\n\n3. **Transformations**:\n   - Interactions with empty planets transform them into busy planets, adding a strategy layer for resource management.\n   - The game includes timers that can affect the state of the planets based on interactions.\n\n4. **Interactions with Dangerous Sprites**: \n   - The blackhole is a significant threat, capable of instantly killing the avatar but also awarding points if it does so.\n   - Nebulae cause damage to the player upon contact, while the active bombs require dodging.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objectives are:\n- Survive by managing health points while navigating the environment.\n- Transform empty planets into busy ones, likely for resource collection or strategic advantages.\n- Avoid fatal interactions with the blackhole and other hazards to continue the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The game is won if the blackhole sprite count reaches zero.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The game is lost if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero (indicating the player's avatar has been killed).\n  - If the game times out after reaching its maximum limit of 1000 time units, it will also result in a loss.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**: \n   - Prioritize avoiding bomb interactions and utilize busy planets to regain health when necessary.\n  \n2. **Map Navigation**:\n   - Explore the layout to find empty planets and convert them into busy ones strategically. The transformation should be balanced with health management since busy planets can offer healing potential.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Keep a safe distance from the blackhole, implementing a strategic retreat when engaging with risky objects like bombard turrets.\n   - Be on the lookout for the bomb emitters and prioritize dodging them to maintain health.\n\n4. **Resource Utilization**:\n   - Focus on converting empty planets while maintaining or advancing health levels. Understanding the layout will be critical to finding safe routes and resources.\n\n5. **Timing and Positioning**:\n   - Pay attention to the timing of bomb drops from turrets; learn their patterns to avoid getting hit.\n   - Time interactions with the atmosphere to allow for a more tactical conversion of the planets when the effect ends.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can maximize their chances of surviving longer while working towards victory by managing their resources effectively and interacting wisely with the various sprites in the game world.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

The strategy focuses on managing health, transforming empty planets into busy ones, and avoiding hazards like bombs and blackholes.\n\nSince your avatar position is pivotal and not moving can indicate a need to change strategy, if you recently faced a hazardous situation, it\u2019s essential to either navigate away from dangers while seeking resources or engage with an empty planet for conversion.\n\nGiven that I need to choose my actions based on these factors, please provide me with the current state of the game, including my avatar's position, health points, nearby objects, and any hazards present. Once I have that information, I can make a tactical decision on which action to take.",
