    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules and level layout provided, here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be an action-adventure game with elements of survival and strategy. It likely incorporates real-time mechanics where players must navigate through a space-themed environment while managing resources and avoiding dangerous interactions.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, such as the player's avatar (spaceship), nebulae, black holes, planets, turrets, bombs, and atmospheres. Each sprite has specific interactions:\n  - The **avatar** can collect health points from planets and must avoid harmful interactions with bombs, nebulae, and black holes.\n  - **Turrets** drop bombs periodically, which the player must observe.\n  - Planets can change states from empty to busy when interacted with by the avatar, influencing gameplay dynamics.\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - **Health Management**: The avatar can lose health from several sources (nebula, bomb) and gain health from planets.\n  - **Transformation Mechanics**: The avatar can transform empty planets into busy ones, suggesting a strategic element of resource control.\n  - **Timer Mechanic**: The atmosphere sprite has a function for creating timers that may alter the states of planets, adding another layer of strategic depth.\n\n### Objectives\nThe primary objectives are:\n- Avoid losing all health points; if the avatar's health reaches zero, the game is lost.\n- Try to eliminate all black holes to win the game.\n- Maintain a timer before a timeout occurs (in this case, 1000 units of time), as failing to do so results in a loss.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins by eliminating all black holes present in the game.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar's health points drop to zero due to interactions.\n  - The timeout limit of 1000 units is exceeded without winning.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Health Management**: Prioritize collecting health from planets to sustain the avatar's health while avoiding damage from bombs and nebulae. Monitor the state of your health regularly.\n  \n2. **Time Awareness**: Keep an eye on the timer and try to complete objectives promptly to avoid a timeout. The avatar must act swiftly yet wisely to achieve goals without rushing into danger.\n\n3. **Planet Control**: Utilize the avatar's ability to transform empty planets. This can be a strategic move to fortify health gain options and potentially create safe zones. Focus on aligning with empty planets whenever possible.\n\n4. **Bomb Awareness**: The turrets can launch bombs, which the player will need to dodge or use strategically to facilitate desired interactions.\n\n5. **Evaluate Black Holes**: Develop a plan to confront or neutralize black holes efficiently, ensuring you do so without compromising your health.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path**: Analyze the level layout and choose movement paths that minimize encounters with hazardous sprites while maximizing health and resource acquisition.\n\nBy applying these strategies, players can enhance their experience and improve their chances of winning in this space-themed action-adventure game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To effectively respond and choose an action with the provided strategies in mind, I must first understand the current scenario, including the avatar's position and surroundings as well as any immediate threats or opportunities. \n\nSince I must ensure my movement is strategic and necessary based on the avatar's current state:\n\n1. If I observe that my avatar isn't changing position, I need to reanalyze the surroundings and assess potential threats or health opportunities.\n2. I should prioritize actions that would either lead toward health-giving planets or away from risks like bombs and nebulae.\n3. Since I don't have the current position or state details, my action will lean towards rotation or movement away from hazards if necessary.\n\nAssuming I need to rotate the avatar and my last action was an attempt to move down but led to no position change, I will take a different approach.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action suggests I will move UP after the last attempt to go DOWN did not yield movement, expecting to position myself better either towards a potential health source or to reassess my surroundings. This aligns with the strategy of managing health and moving towards safer zones.",
