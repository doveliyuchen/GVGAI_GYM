    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to belong to the **action/arcade genre**, with elements of adventure and survival. The presence of various sprites and playful interactions suggests a dynamic gameplay environment. \n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features different types of sprites: the avatar (controlled by the player), immovable objects (nebula, black hole), passive entities (planets), and dangerous entities (bombs, turrets).\n- **Interactions:** The central gameplay mechanic revolves around the avatar navigating the environment, interacting with various entities to gain health or avoid damage, while also managing time and staying alive.\n  - The avatar can gain health by visiting planets or lose it by hitting obstacles (like the nebula) or bombs.\n  - The avatar can transform an empty planet into a busy planet by interacting with it.\n  - The avatar is penalized for engaging with bombs and is killed upon touching the black hole.\n  \n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to survive by managing the avatar's health points, while strategically transforming empty planets into busy ones. You also need to avoid threats and eventually eliminate all black holes to achieve win conditions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:** \n  - All black holes must be eliminated before the conditions outlined below occur.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:** \n  - The avatar's health points reaching zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0) results in a loss.\n  - If the timeout limit of 1000 is reached without completing the objective, the player loses.\n  \n**Possible Strategy:**\n1. **Health Management:** Make sure to frequently visit planets to regain health and avoid areas with bombs and the black hole that can rapidly reduce health or end the game.\n2. **Avoid Damage:** Keep a distance from bombs and nebulae; their interactions can take away health points quickly.\n3. **Transformation Strategy:** Focus on transforming empty planets into busy planets. This can enhance player survivability and reduce damage from certain interactions.\n4. **Use Time Wisely:** Pay close attention to the timer and plan actions in a way that balances health recovery and the elimination of black holes.\n5. **Movement Pacing:** Since the avatar's speed is relatively low, plan movements to avoid turrets and bombs effectively, or develop a route where you can maneuver through the area to minimize risk.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of winning while navigating the game's various threats and opportunities.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To determine the best course of action, I first need to analyze the current state of my avatar's position and the nearby entities, while also remembering my strategic objectives.\n\n1. **Health Management**: I need to ensure I'm near planets to regain health.\n2. **Avoid Damage**: I must steer clear of bombs and the black hole.\n3. **Transformation**: If I am near empty planets, I should prioritize transforming them.\n4. **Time Management**: I need to act quickly, as I am under a timer.\n5. **Movement**: I need to move in a way to minimize damage while making progress towards my objectives.\n\nNow, with this analysis in mind, I will take an action based on the current sprite positions:\n\n- If my avatar is currently stuck or unable to move effectively from its original position, I should rotate first and then take a directional action to effectively navigate away from dangerous obstacles or towards beneficial opportunities.\n\nAssuming the current game state indicates I haven\u2019t moved yet and the last action was a directional one but resulted in me not changing position, I\u2019ll take meaningful directional action afterward.\n\nLet\u2019s take action now.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will direct my avatar to the right. I expect this will help ventilate through possible hidden threats while staying on path towards a more beneficial encounter.",
