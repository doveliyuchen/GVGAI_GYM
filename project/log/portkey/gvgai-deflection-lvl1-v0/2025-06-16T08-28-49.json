    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**:  \nThe game appears to fall within the **action-adventure** genre, possibly with elements of strategy and survival. It involves navigating through a space-themed environment while managing health and interacting with various sprites (game objects).\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**: Various immovable and movable game objects, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can move but has health points.\n   - **Nebula**: An obstacle that deducts health if the avatar interacts with it.\n   - **Blackhole**: A passive object that kills the avatar but rewards score points upon interaction.\n   - **Turret**: Randomly generates bombs that can harm the avatar and force a health deduction.\n   - **Planets**: Both empty and busy planets that affect avatar health positively when interacted with.\n\n2. **Health System**:  \n   - The avatar has a health point system (15/20 HP), and various actions can increase or decrease this health.\n   - Interacting with nebulae and bombs decreases health, while interacting with planets increases it.\n\n3. **Interaction Rules**: The avatar interacts with multiple sprites, leading to various outcomes such as health deduction, alignment, transformation of planets from empty to busy, and receiving bonuses from atmospheres.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe main objective is to survive by maintaining health while navigating the area and transforming empty planets into busy ones to increase health points. The player must avoid hazards like nebulae and bombs, and must strategically interact with planets.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the number of blackhole sprites reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's health reaches zero or the game times out after 1000 units of time with conditions not met.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions:\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Constantly steer clear of the nebulae and bombs as they reduce health. If you must approach them, ensure your health is sufficient for survival.\n\n2. **Health Management**: Prioritize transforming empty planets to busy planets. Busy planets grant health boosts, enabling you to offset the health loss incurred from hazardous interactions.\n\n3. **Utilize Blackholes**: Be aware that blackholes can kill the avatar but also grant points. Depending on the game's scoring system, you might aim to interact with them strategically if it appears beneficial.\n\n4. **Space Navigation**: Since the avatar has limited speed (0.5), plan movements carefully. Avoid unnecessary backtracking and aim to move in a way that maximizes health gain interactions before the player runs into obstacles.\n\n5. **Use Total Time Efficiently**: Keep track of the time limit and prioritize actions that lead to clearing blackholes and converting planets before the timeout occurs.\n\nBy forming a defensive playstyle centered around health preservation and actively converting planets, players can enhance longevity and the potential for clearing blackholes efficiently. Prioritize interactions wisely while remaining aware of the threats present in the environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To provide a coherent action, I need to first analyze the state to identify the avatar's current position and the nearby sprites, noting any potential hazards or health-gaining opportunities. Given the mechanics of the game, it's crucial to ascertain whether the avatar's position is stable or whether it needs movement to avoid hazards or engage with health-boosting bodies.\n\nOnce I confirm that context, I can formulate an action aligned with the strategy of avoiding hazards and prioritizing health management.\n\nGiven that I don't have specific information about the current state, let me assume a placeholder state. In that case, here's a possible action based on the general strategy:\n\n``` Action: ACTION_RIGHT ```\n\nThis action is justifiable as it represents movement away from obstacles while seeking potential health-gaining planets on the right. I expect to verify the avatar's spatial dynamics in subsequent states after this action.",
