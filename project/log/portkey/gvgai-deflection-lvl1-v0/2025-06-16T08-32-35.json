    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided description and rules, the game appears to be a **2D action-adventure puzzle game** with elements of survival and resource management. The game involves navigating a space environment, fighting against hazards, and managing the player's health through interactions with sprites.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Movement & Navigation:** The game involves an avatar that can move around the level. The avatar's speed is relatively slow, which may emphasize careful planning and avoiding hazards.\n- **Health Management:** The avatar has health points (HP) that can be reduced by collisions with a \u201cnebula\u201d or \u201cbomb\u201d sprites. However, it can gain HP by interacting with \u201cplanets\u201d.\n- **Dynamic Interactions:** \n  - Interacting with an \u201cemptyPlanet\u201d transforms it into a \u201cbusyPlanet,\u201d possibly indicating resource acquisition or area control.\n  - \u201catmosphere\u201d can grant a timed effect to transform busy planets back to empty ones, implying resource regeneration mechanics.\n- **Potential Hazards:**\n  - The \u201cbomb\u201d can inflict damage and distract the player, while navigating near a \u201cblackhole\u201d can lead to instant defeat.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be to survive and maneuver strategically within the level to either:\n1. Avoid losing all health points (keep the avatar alive).\n2. Ensure that there are no remaining \u201dblackholes\u201d as it is linked with victory conditions.\n3. Manipulate the space environment by transforming planets to sustain health and resources.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - The player wins if all \u201cblackholes\u201d are eliminated or rendered inactive.\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The player loses if the avatar\u2019s health points drop to zero.\n  - The game also ends in loss if the timer runs out without achieving the win condition.\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize interacting with planets to maintain health, especially if the level is particularly hazardous.\n   - Use the atmosphere to convert busy planets back to empty if they are becoming too dangerous with bomb sprites.\n\n2. **Hazard Avoidance:**\n   - Be cautious and avoid areas with high concentrations of nebulae and bombs. Plan movement patterns that minimize exposure to these hazards.\n   - If a bomb attracts gaze, use this to your advantage to create distance while navigating around other dangers.\n\n3. **Strategic Area Control:**\n   - Transform empty planets into busy planets strategically to create more health-restorative zones.\n   - Control the area around busy planets to ensure safety and replenishment while avoiding frequent damage from hazards.\n\n4. **Timer Awareness:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timeout. Plan moves quickly but carefully to ensure that gameplay is efficient, aiming to defeat blackholes before the timer runs out.\n\n5. **Continuous Movement:**\n   - While the avatar\u2019s speed is slow, maintain steady movement to mitigate the risks of being targeted by bombs or damage-causing sprites. \n\nBy mastering the interactions, managing resources effectively, and using the environment to your advantage, players can navigate the challenges and ultimately achieve victory in this complex space-based adventure.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To make an informed move, I need to analyze the current state of the game, which includes the avatar's position, potential hazards nearby, and any planets I can interact with for health management.\n\nBased on the strategy laid out, I need to prioritize avoiding hazards, managing health resources through interaction with planets, and keeping an eye on the timer.\n\nSince the last action led to no change in the avatar's position, it suggests we might have rotated without moving. To achieve movement in the intended direction (most likely away from hazards and towards beneficial planets), I will assess the layout and choose a smart action based on this understanding. \n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nI believe moving left will help avoid potential bomb hazards, aligning with our strategy of hazard avoidance and resource management. I expect to see a change in position that will improve my situation in the game.",
