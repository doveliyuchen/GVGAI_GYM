    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and descriptions, we can analyze the game in terms of genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fit into the **action-adventure** genre with elements of **strategy** and **survival**. It involves combat mechanics (with various types of sprites interacting through attacks and defenses) and exploration (navigating between planets and avoiding hazards).\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites are present, including avatars, bombs, turrets, black holes, planets, and nebulas. Each sprite has defined behaviors and interactions.\n2. **Health and Scoring**: The avatar has a health system that can be affected by interactions (e.g., nebulas and bombs reduce health, while planets can restore health). The objective is also influenced by score changes related to black holes.\n3. **Movement**: The avatar has a specified speed and is capable of moving and transforming sprites in the game world.\n4. **Environmental Hazards**: Black holes are lethal to the avatar but provide scoring opportunities, while nebulas and bombs pose health threats.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to:\n- Survive by managing the avatar's health against threats.\n- Transform empty planets into busy planets while avoiding hazards.\n- Eliminate or manage black holes to win the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Conditions**: The player wins if the count of black hole sprites reaches zero (you have eliminated the threat).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's health reaches zero or if time expires after 1000 seconds.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Prioritize Health Management**: Keep an eye on the avatar's health during play. Actively seek out planets to replenish health, especially after taking damage from nebulas or bombs.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of bombs and nebulas that can deplete health significantly. Utilize the avatar's speed strategically to evade these threats as much as possible.\n3. **Use the Environment**: Take advantage of the planets available. Transform empty planets by interacting with them to create busy planets, which may offer benefits in terms of health restoration or safety from other hazards.\n4. **Engage with Black Holes**: Balance the engagement with black holes to ensure they are eliminated while also being mindful of the score changes that may affect gameplay strategy.\n5. **Allocate Timer Wisely**: Manage timers provided through interactions to effectively handle transitions between busy and empty planet states, further amplifying your health regeneration capacity.\n\nOverall, the key to winning this game lies in maintaining health, avoiding threats, transforming planets, and effectively navigating the environment while monitoring interactions closely.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
