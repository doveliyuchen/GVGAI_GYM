Each has unique properties, such as being passive, immovable, or having interactive elements.\n  \n- **Movement and Interactions**: The avatar can move and interact with various sprites in the environment. Interactions can lead to health modifications, transformations of planets, and triggering specific effects like damage from bombs or healing from planets.\n\n- **Active and Passive Game Elements**: The avatar functions actively, while other elements like planets and turrets behave passively or randomly (such as the bomb turrets that have a cooldown and a probability of firing).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game seems to be to manage the avatar's health while navigating a grid-like space environment filled with different sprites. The avatar needs to ensure that blackholes do not outnumber their health by:\n\n1. **Collecting health** from planets.\n2. **Avoiding or managing interactions** with harmful elements like nebulae and bombs.\n3. **Transforming empty planets into busy planets** to perhaps gain more resources or health benefits.\n4. **Defeating or bypassing threats** (like bombs and blackholes) to survive.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**: The player wins if the number of blackholes reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if their avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero), or if the game times out after 1000 moves.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement and Exploration**: Actively scout the environment for planets to heal and to turn empty planets into busy ones for later benefits. Careful movement is crucial to avoid damage from bombs and nebulae.\n\n2. **Health Management**: Avoid the area of influence of bombs and nebulae, as they can drain your health points. Focus on gathering health from busy planets whenever necessary.\n\n3. **Using Bombs and Turrets**: Take advantage of the turrets\u2019 random bomb drops. If positioned well, they may inadvertently protect you from or distract threats.\n\n4. **Tactical Engagement with Blackholes**: While eliminating blackholes is part of victory, do so cautiously. Make sure your health is sufficiently high and that you\u2019re not standing in proximity to immediate threats.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Be aware of the timer. Plan your actions wisely to either eliminate blackholes efficiently or gather resources without taking unnecessary damage.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies and understanding the interactions within the game\u2019s mechanics, players can improve their chances of success while navigating this complex environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

Since I do not have the specific state of the game or my current position, I suggest taking a directional action to explore the environment further.\n\nThis will allow me to check if there are any nearby planets to heal from, as well as potential threats like blackholes, nebulae, or bombs that I need to avoid.\n\nGiven that I have no specific prior position or context, I will proceed with an initial move in a direction.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will help to explore what is available to the left and may uncover resources or threats, aligning with the strategy to manage health and navigate the environment efficiently.",
