The presence of different sprites, including the avatar, enemies (thugs and a boss), and resources (like keys and villains), indicates a focus on exploration, combat, and resource management.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Game Components:**\n   - **Sprites:** Each sprite has specific characteristics such as immovability, color, images, and behaviors (e.g., thugs flee, the avatar moves).\n   - **Resources:** The avatar can collect keys and defeat villains to gain points. Each type of villain (red, green, yellow) has different point values.\n   - **Interactions:** Specific interactions determine how the avatar collects resources, deals with enemies, and navigates the environment. For example, colliding with a key increases the avatar's resources, while colliding with a thug will change the resource count for villains and can kill the thug.\n\n2. **Objectives:**\n   - The primary objective for the player (avatar) is to collect resources (keys and villains) and defeat enemies while navigating through the map to eventually defeat the boss.\n   - The player must manage their resources effectively to maximize their score, particularly by targeting certain villains for higher scores.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - The player wins the game by defeating the boss (ensuring that the sprite counter for the boss is zero) and appropriately interacting with the various sprites to collect enough points.\n   - The player loses if the time runs out (timeout limit of 1900 units).\n\n**Level Layout:**\nThe layout indicates a maze-like structure with walls (w), open spaces (.), various sprites like the avatar (A), depot (d), jaildoor (j), and different villain types. The layout suggests strategic paths to navigate, depicting areas to explore.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Exploration and Resource Management:**\n   - **Start by exploring the maze** to familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify where the keys and thugs are located, as well as where the boss is situated.\n   - **Focus on collecting keys early** since they are critical for accessing certain areas (such as the jail) and unlocking doors.\n\n2. **Prioritization of Targets:**\n   - **Target villains strategically.** Given their point values, prioritize defeating red villains for 100 points, followed by yellow (5 points) and then green (2 points).\n   - Taking down thugs will also help in managing villains, as you can convert them into resources while scoring points.\n\n3. **Use Interactions Wisely:**\n   - Utilize the jail and depot effectively; ensure you are spawning the correct sprites and managing your resource limits.\n   - Be mindful about the limits: since red, green, and yellow villains only appear once, plan your kills accordingly.\n\n4. **Timing and Movement:**\n   - Keep an eye on the clock. Make efficient movements to avoid time waste while engaging with enemies. \n   - Avoid getting trapped by walls or being backed into corners by enemies like thugs. Always have a pathway to escape.\n\n5. **Confronting the Boss:**\n   - Prepare for the boss encounter by ensuring you've gathered sufficient resources and points from defeating thugs and collecting villains.\n   - Make sure you understand the boss\u2019 behaviors and patterns from the mechanics presented, allowing you to plan your attack (or avoidance) accordingly.\n\nBy systematically exploring the environment, efficiently managing resources, prioritizing threats, and keeping track of the timer, you can successfully navigate the game\u2019s challenges while aiming for a high score and ultimately defeating the boss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
