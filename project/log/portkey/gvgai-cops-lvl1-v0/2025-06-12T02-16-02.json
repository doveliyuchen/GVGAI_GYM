Since you can only have one key, use it wisely to maximize the potential of spawning resources.\n  \n2. **Enemy Control**: \n   - Focus on eliminating thugs as they provide villain resources upon defeat. Make sure to choose the right moment to engage to avoid being overwhelmed.\n   - Be strategic when engaging different thug types since they spawn specific villains, which give varying points.\n  \n3. **Utilize the Environment**: \n   - Make use of walls to block thugs and create safe paths for the avatar to navigate through the level without encountering multiple enemies at once.\n  \n4. **Timing is Key**: \n   - Monitor the time remaining to ensure you are on track to defeat the boss before running out of time. If you reach the end of your time limit, you lose regardless of your current score or villain resources.\n   \n5. **Plan for Boss Encounters**: \n   - Prepare for the boss; ensure you have enough resources and have managed thugs well to reduce chaos when you initiate the encounter.\n\nBy following this strategic approach, players can maximize their chances of defeating the boss and achieving a win in this engaging action puzzle game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
