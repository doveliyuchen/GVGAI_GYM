    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, we can derive quite a bit about the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, and overall strategies.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **2D action-adventure game** or a **puzzle-platformer**. It features elements such as resource management, character interactions, and possible combat mechanics.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent various objects and characters, including the player's avatar (the cop), villains (thugs), and immovable walls and doors.\n- **Movement and Interaction**: The avatar can move around the level and interact with different sprites. Collisions result in different actions:\n  - Walking into walls causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Collecting keys when interacting with them.\n  - Interacting with jails can lead to resource changes or death if conditions are met, indicating a need to strategize on how and when to interact with them.\n- **Resource Management**: The avatar collects keys and must manage variants of resources (red, green, yellow villains) that seem to derive from defeating thugs.\n- **Score Changes**: Players gain points for defeating specific enemies and interacting with resources positively.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to defeat the boss and the villains within the level while managing time. The game has two termination conditions:\n1. The player loses if the time runs out (1900 seconds).\n2. The player wins if they defeat the boss (sprite limit becomes 0).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Defeat the boss.\n- **Loss Condition**: Run out of time (1900 seconds).\n- Resources gathered (like keys) have limited uses, and players should be mindful of their status to prevent reaching a game-over state.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Collection**: Focus first on collecting keys early in the game, as this will be crucial for opening jaildoors and handling the other sprites effectively.\n2. **Enemy Management**: Prioritize defeating thugs to gain their respective resources. This may require careful positioning and timing to avoid taking damage.\n3. **Plan Interactions**: Determine the order of interactions with the jails, as spawning more resources at the jails (like greentrans, yellowtrans, and redtrans) is essential for maximizing your score and defeating all villains.\n4. **Manage Time**: Keep an eye on the timer; if it becomes a concern, focus on a few high-value targets (like defeating the boss or collecting high-value villain resources) rather than exploring.\n5. **Use Walls Strategically**: Leverage the walls for strategic positioning to avoid attacks from fleeing thugs and block potential routes.\n6. **Watch for Alerts**: The interaction mechanics suggest that specific interactions (like encountering a jaildoor with the key resource) can result in instant effects; ensure the avatar is well-equipped (with the key) when approaching these interactions.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith planning and sequential execution of actions based on resource availability, a player should be able to manage the game's challenges and work toward defeating the enemies and the boss efficiently. Focus on resource management, enemy encounters, and time management for a successful run!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
