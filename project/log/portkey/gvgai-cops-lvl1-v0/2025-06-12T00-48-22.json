    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and layouts, the game can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **action-adventure genre**, with elements of strategy due to resource management and enemy interactions. It combines exploration with combat mechanics, as players control an avatar that navigates through a layout filled with different characters and interactions.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**:\n   - Players control an `avatar` (represented by an image of a cop) that can move through a grid-like structure.\n   - There are obstacles (`walls`, `floor`, `jaildoor`, etc.) and enemies (`thug`, `redthug`, `greenthug`, `yellowthug`, `boss`) that the avatar interacts with.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - The avatar can collect keys, which are a limited resource. The key is essential for progressing through jail doors, which are barriers to achieving objectives.\n   - Defeating enemies generates resource points (villains - colored based on enemy types) and changes the avatar's score based on the type of enemies defeated.\n\n3. **Spawn Mechanic**:\n   - The game has sections where defeating enemies or acquiring resources causes the spawning of transport sprites (redtrans, greentrans, yellowtrans) that correspond to the enemies captured, allowing further resource collection and scoring.\n\n4. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect or change the state of entities in the game through specific interactions:\n     - Collecting keys or defeating thugs changes certain resource values.\n     - Encountering the boss will result in defeat unless managed well.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all bosses (sprite type: `boss`). The game also emphasizes resource management by collecting keys and defeating enemies to score points and gain resources.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player loses if the timeout limit of 1900 seconds is reached.\n- The game is won if all bosses are defeated (i.e., the `SpriteCounter` for the boss reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Control**: \n   - Prioritize collecting the key as early as possible since it is essential for accessing life-giving areas and interacting with jail doors.\n\n2. **Enemy Engagement**: \n   - Focus on picking off thugs one by one to accumulate the corresponding villain resources. This should be done while being aware of the movement patterns of the thugs to avoid unnecessary damage or setbacks.\n\n3. **Plan Routes**:\n   - Make strategic movements through the level to avoid dead ends and traps. Since walls block movement and may push enemies back, use this to your advantage by cornering thugs or leading them into traps.\n\n4. **Resource Utilization**:\n   - Once villains are captured, utilize the transport sprites effectively to maintain scoring momentum; focus on discovering and activating redtrans, greentrans, and yellowtrans to maximize point gains.\n\n5. **Time Management**:\n   - Keep an eye on the timer to ensure that progress is being made efficiently within the time limit; avoid stagnation during exploration or enemy encounters.\n\n6. **Boss Engagement**:\n   - Prepare for the boss encounter towards the end of the level, having gathered sufficient resources and ensuring your health and ability to move within the timeline.\n\nBy utilizing this strategy effectively throughout the game, players will optimize their chances of winning and minimize the risks associated with the various mechanics and interactions present.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

    "content": "Given the current state, your avatar (represented as 'a') is located at (row=6, col=6). It is surrounded by floor tiles, and there are some jail doors nearby as well as other obstacles and enemies further down the map.\n\nFrom the strategic analysis, considering your immediate surroundings and the overall objectives of the game, the goals include collecting keys and defeating enemies to surpass the challenges presented.\n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n- You are currently on a floor tile and have plenty of room surrounding you to move in various directions.\n- The nearest resource (key indicated by 'j') is located in the row 6, column 3, marked as a depot ('#'), but on this specific map layout, it does not directly show a 'j'. \n- Based on your current position, the most beneficial action seems to explore different available paths to collect resources or engage potential enemies.\n\n### Direction Choices:\n1. **UP (row=5)**: This would lead to an empty floor space.\n2. **DOWN (row=7)**: This route also leads to an empty floor, where potentially more tactical options could emerge.\n3. **LEFT (col=5)**: This move stays on the floor, but doesn't seem to lead any closer to an immediate objective of interaction.\n4. **RIGHT (col=7)**: Again, it\u2019s just another empty tile.\n\nEach direction effectively leads to more floor tiles, but I would recommend moving towards more unexplored areas since they may provide new keys or enemies to defeat.\n\nBased on the importance of resource gathering and avoiding stagnation, the most suitable option appears to be moving DOWN towards row 7.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows for better exploration of the area beneath while maintaining options for further movement and interaction with the surrounding space. Expect to see increased resource opportunities and enemy engagements as the encounter progresses.",
