Collecting specific resources (villains) plays an important role in achieving this.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Condition:** The player wins if there are no boss sprites left on the screen (SpriteCounter check).\n- **Losing Condition:** The player loses if a timeout occurs (1900 ticks) or if no successful actions led to defeating the boss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - **Collect Keys Early:** Prioritize collecting keys as they are essential for unlocking jail doors.\n   - **Focus on Villains:** Try to capture as many villains (through defeating thugs) as possible because certain villains provide different resources which can spawn transports that contribute to defeating the boss.\n\n2. **Spatial Awareness:**\n   - **Navigate Carefully:** The layout shows walls that can restrict movement, so plan routes carefully to avoid being cornered by thugs or walls.\n   - **Predict Thug Movements:** Since thugs are fleeing avatars, anticipate their movement patterns to corner and defeat them strategically.\n\n3. **Strategic Engagement:**\n   - **Engage in Combat When Necessary:** Monitor how many villains of each color you have and determine when is the best time to confront the thugs for resource collection.\n   - **Use the Jail and Transport:** Make sure to leverage the jail for spawning various transport resources based on collected villains to increase score and resources.\n\n4. **Plan Before Acting:**\n   - **Consider Actions Before Making Moves:** Make sure that each move is calculated, especially when approaching crucial interactions (like with the boss or jaildoor).\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - **Be Aware of the Clock:** As you have a limited time to defeat the boss sprite, create a balance between gathering resources and attacking thugs while also keeping an eye on the remaining time.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics, the player can effectively navigate through challenges and work towards defeating the boss while efficiently managing resources.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
