Players control an avatar that interacts with various elements in the environment in order to solve puzzles and reach specific objectives, such as collecting keys or reaching goals.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites/Elements**:\n  - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character who can move and interact with other sprites.\n  - **Goal**: The endpoint that the player needs to reach in order to win the game. It requires the avatar to be in possession of a key to be reachable.\n  - **Key**: Allows the avatar to transform from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\", unlocking the goal.\n  - **Boxes**: Can bounce the avatar forward and are involved in several interactions with other sprites.\n  - **Holes**: Dangerous spots that end the game if the avatar falls in.\n  - **Walls**: Impassable obstacles that require strategic movement to navigate around.\n  - **Mushrooms**: Interact negatively with the avatar. Contact results in a loss of life or game state.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the **goal sprite** while managing the key collection and avoiding deadly interactions such as holes and mushrooms. To successfully reach the goal, the player must collect the key and transform the avatar to allow them to \"unlock\" the goal.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully reach the goal sprite with the transformed avatar (withkey) which results in a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game ends if either:\n  1. The avatar sprite count reaches 0 (indicating the player has lost all lives).\n  2. The avatar interacts with certain negative sprites like holes or mushrooms.\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Carefully maneuver the avatar to avoid walls and particularly the holes and mushrooms. Make use of the boxes to bounce off and clear paths when necessary.\n  \n2. **Key Collection**: The player should prioritize interacting with the key sprite when available. This transformation is essential to access the goal sprite and should be planned for.\n\n3. **Moving Strategy**: Since the avatar cannot pass through walls and is actively hindered by holes, movement must be calculated to avoid corner situations where escape is impossible. Once acquiring the key, players should head toward the goal sprite strategically, ensuring that they don\u2019t backtrack unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Stay aware of the available sprites at each level, especially boxes and walls, as these can be used to create pathways or bounce the avatar out of dangerous situations.\n\n5. **Anticipation of Obstacles**: Players should anticipate where interactions might lead to trouble. For example, contacting a mushroom is detrimental, so strategies should be developed to avoid them.\n\nBy employing careful planning and a strategic approach to navigating the level, the player can successfully reach the goal and win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
