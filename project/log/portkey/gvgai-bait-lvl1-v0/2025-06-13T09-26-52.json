    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle game, likely a Sokoban-inspired or block-pushing puzzle game with some added mechanics.\n\n**Objective:** The player's goal is to open the locked goal (door) and ultimately make all goal sprites disappear, leading to a win. This likely involves acquiring a key and then using it to open the door.\n\n**Sprites and Their Roles:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player-controlled character (initially 'nokey').\n*   **Floor:** Invisible background tiles.\n*   **Hole:** A hazard; falling in kills the player.\n*   **nokey:** Avatar sprite without key.\n*   **withkey:** Avatar sprite with key.\n*   **Mushroom:** A collectible that grants points but eliminates the mushroom upon collection\n*   **Key:** Collectible needed to open the goal.\n*   **Goal:** The locked door/exit; the final objective.\n*   **Box:** Pushable blocks; a core mechanic.\n*   **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player moves the avatar.\n*   **Pushing:** The player can push boxes. This is limited, as the player cannot move through boxes.\n*   **Key Collection:** The player needs to pick up a key.\n*   **Transformation:** Picking up a key transforms the player's avatar from `nokey` to `withkey`.\n*   **Obstacles:** Walls block movement; holes are deadly.\n*   **Scoring:** Pushing a box into a hole and reaching the goal with the key grant points.\n*   **Undoing:** If a box is pushed between a wall, another box, and a mushroom, all steps are undone.\n\n**Win Condition:** All of the goal sprites are eliminated. The `SpriteCounter` rule specifies winning when the number of 'goal' sprites reaches 0.\n\n**Loss Condition:** All of the avatar sprites are eliminated. The `SpriteCounter` rule specifies losing when the number of 'avatar' sprites reaches 0, which likely happens from falling into a hole.\n\n**Interactions Breakdown:**\n\n*   **`avatar wall > stepBack`**: Prevents the avatar from moving through walls.\n*   **`avatar hole > killSprite`**: Avatar dies if it falls into a hole.\n*   **`box avatar > bounceForward`**: The avatar can only push one box at a time, and it cannot move through it.\n*   **`box wall box mushroom > undoAll`**: A special condition that reverts the game state. This is a crucial element for puzzle design.\n*   **`box hole > killBoth scoreChange=1`**: Pushing a box into a hole eliminates both and gives the player a point.\n*   **`nokey key > transformTo stype=withkey`**: The avatar transforms into the `withkey` variant when it interacts with a key.\n*   **`key avatar > killSprite`**: The key disappears when the avatar interacts with it.\n*   **`nokey goal > stepBack`**: Prevents the `nokey` avatar from moving through the goal.\n*   **`goal withkey > killSprite scoreChange=5`**: The goal disappears (unlocks) when the avatar `withkey` interacts with it. This also scores points.\n*   **`mushroom avatar > killSprite scoreChange=1`**: The player can move through the mushroom, and it is removed when doing so, and the player scores points.\n\n**Level Analysis (Based on the Provided Layout):**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `.`: Floor\n*   `A`: Avatar (starting position)\n*   `k`: Key\n*   `g`: Goal\n*   `0`: Mushroom\n*   `1`: Box\n\nThe level is small but seems to have a key to be collected and boxes to potentially push into holes or use to create a path. The placement of the mushrooms relative to the boxes and walls is important because it could potentially undo game steps.\n\n**Possible Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** The first priority is to get the key.\n2.  **Box Placement:** The player may have to push boxes into holes to clear paths or to reach the key.\n3.  **Mushroom/Undo Avoidance/Utilization:** The player must be aware of the \"undo\" mechanic and plan moves carefully to avoid unintentionally resetting the level. It may also be a necessary part of the solution.\n4.  **Goal Access:** After getting the key, the player must navigate to the goal.\n5.  **Final Step:** With the key, interact with the goal to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
