    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre**:  \nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**, where the player must navigate a level, solving puzzles, avoiding hazards, and collecting items to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n- The player controls an **avatar** that can move around the screen.\n- Various object interactions are defined; for instance, moving against a wall causes the avatar to step back, while moving into a hole results in losing a life.\n- The avatar can interact with **keys**; they can transform a \"nokey\" sprite into a \"withkey\" sprite, allowing access to the goal.\n- There are also **boxes** that can bounce the avatar, interact with walls, or can be placed in holes for potential scoring.\n- The presence of **mushrooms** which, when contacted by the avatar, also lead to a loss of life, suggests they act as another obstacle.\n  \n**Objective**:  \nThe main objective of the game is to collect the key and use it to reach the goal (closed door), while avoiding hazards like holes and mushrooms, thus ensuring the avatar survives through the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero, signaling that the avatar has successfully reached the goal with a key, earning a score change of 5.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero, indicating the avatar has been \"killed\" (lost a life) due to falling into a hole or touching the mushroom.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Navigating the Level**: \n   - Begin by carefully exploring the layout, avoiding immediate hazards. Make sure to prevent the avatar from stepping into holes or touching mushrooms since they lead to a loss of life.\n\n2. **Key Collection**: \n   - Locate the key marked by 'k' as it is critical for accessing the goal. Plan your route to reach the key and transform the nokey into a withkey.\n\n3. **Puzzles and Blocks**: \n   - Utilize the boxes effectively; if you find you need to clear a path or manipulate how the avatar moves, experiment with box placement. They can be functional tools for bouncing or blocking other sprites.\n\n4. **Maintaining Life**: \n   - Always be aware of the avatar's surroundings. Avoid running into walls or repeat hazards that will 'kill' the avatar. Take your time to navigate around obstacles.\n\n5. **Final Approach to Goal**:\n   - Once you have the key, make a direct approach towards the goal. Ensure that you are not distracted by other elements and focus on the successful transition to the goal with the key in hand.\n\nBy adopting this strategic approach, players should be able to successfully navigate the level, overcome obstacles, and achieve victory by collecting the necessary items and managing their character's life effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
