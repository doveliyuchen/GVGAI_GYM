    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game likely falls into the **puzzle platformer** genre. Players navigate through a 2D environment while solving puzzles, interacting with various objects, and avoiding hazards to reach a specific goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Goal**: Represents the end objective that must be reached to win the game.\n   - **Key**: Allows transformation of the avatar from a 'nokey' state (not holding a key) to a 'withkey' state (holding a key).\n   - **Box**: Can bounce the avatar and interact with walls and other objects.\n   - **Holes and Mushrooms**: Dangerous areas that can kill the avatar upon interaction, which results in losing.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - When the avatar collides with walls or holes, it either steps back or dies, respectively.\n   - The avatar can transform to a 'withkey' state when it interacts with the key.\n   - There\u2019s a scoring system based on interactions with certain objects, such as earning points when the avatar collides with a mushroom or successfully interacts with the goal situation.\n\n### Objectives:\n- The main objective is to reach the **goal** (door icon) using the **key** to transform the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey', allowing it to unlock the goal and win.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they manage to reach the goal with the 'withkey' avatar, as indicated by the SpriteCounter for the goal reaching zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaching zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Navigating the Environment**: Carefully explore the level layout to avoid falling into holes or colliding with mushrooms that can kill the avatar. Utilize walls and boxes to bounce to safe locations.\n\n2. **Collecting the Key**: Prioritize finding and interacting with the key sprite as this is essential for transforming your avatar for the final goal interaction. \n\n3. **Solving Puzzles with Boxes**: The box can be strategically used to reach different areas or navigate around obstacles. Be attentive to its interactions with walls and mushrooms, as they can either help or hinder your progress.\n\n4. **Overall Caution**: Given the lethal aspects of mushrooms and holes, always proceed with caution. Ensure a safe path is available when moving and always be aware of your surroundings.\n\n5. **Planning Ahead**: Since the game incorporates critical collectible behaviors and interactive elements, develop a plan for how you will reach the key and move towards the goal without getting eliminated.\n\nBy carefully managing these aspects of gameplay, players can develop a successful approach to completing the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
