Players control an avatar that can move and interact with various elements in the environment to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game includes several types of sprites (objects) with different properties, such as immovable objects (walls, floors, holes, mushrooms, and goals) and movable ones (the avatar). \n- **Interactions**: The interactions define how the avatar and other sprites react when they come into contact. For example:\n  - The avatar can't pass through walls but will step back if it collides with one.\n  - If the avatar encounters a hole, it dies; hitting a box bounces the avatar forward; the avatar can pick up a key and transforms from 'nokey' to 'withkey' for advanced interactions.\n- **Goals**: The primary objective is to reach the goal using the key. To win, players need to either avoid losing all avatars or reaching the goal while in possession of the key.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal while avoiding deaths (from holes or mushrooms) and successfully transforming the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey' by collecting the key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the goal sprite is reached with the avatar in the 'withkey' state. The score increases by 5 points when this condition is met.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if all avatars are eliminated (when the avatar's limit reaches 0).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigation**: Move the avatar carefully to avoid holes and mushrooms, which can kill the avatar and reduce the chances of winning.\n2. **Key Collection**: Prioritize reaching the key. This is essential to transforming the avatar so it can interact with the goal.\n3. **Use of Boxes**: The boxes can be used strategically to either bounce the avatar forward or provide protection against falling into holes. Be wary of the box's interaction with the wall and mushroom, which may lead to setbacks.\n4. **Planning Your Route**: Look at the layout and carefully plan a route that allows you to get to the key and then the goal while minimizing exposure to hazards.\n5. **Avoiding Dead Ends**: Make sure to avoid isolating your avatar, ensuring there\u2019s always a path to retreat if needed.\n\nBy understanding these mechanics and following the strategies, players will increase their chances of success in this puzzle-platformer game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
