    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game appears to fall under the puzzle-platformer genre, where the player controls an avatar (a character) navigating a two-dimensional environment. The goal involves solving puzzles influenced by various interconnected game mechanics.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** Represent fixed elements such as walls, the floor, holes, and goals.\n   - **Moving Avatar:** The player-controlled character.\n   - **Passive Sprites:** Includes keys and boxes that can interact with the avatar or other objects without movement.\n   - **Kill Interactions:** Certain interactions, like falling into holes or mushrooms, result in the avatar\u2019s exit from the game (failure).\n   - **Transformation:** The avatar can transform from `nokey` (without a key) to `withkey` (after picking up a key).\n   \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, which can push or move the avatar away from static objects.\n   - Collecting a key can grant access to the goal (door), but if the avatar runs into the goal without having the key, it cannot progress.\n   - Interaction with mushrooms leads to the avatar's demise and results in a score change.\n   \n3. **Score System:**\n   - Collecting keys (and possibly other objectives) changes the score, providing motivational incentives for completing levels effectively.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to reach the goal (door) while avoiding hazards (holes, mushrooms) and collecting keys. The player must manipulate boxes wisely to navigate the level efficiently.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there are no goal sprites left (i.e., the player reaches the door using the key).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the number of avatars reaches zero (i.e., the player loses their avatar through falling into holes or getting killed).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify where the holes, walls, and potential keys are positioned.\n  \n2. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious around holes and mushrooms, as they lead to an instant game over.\n   \n3. **Key Management:**\n   - Collect the key as soon as possible\u2014this is crucial for progressing toward the win condition.\n   - Ensure you have the key before attempting to approach the goal.\n\n4. **Utilize Boxes:**\n   - Use the boxes strategically to manipulate your movement through the level. They can provide a bouncing mechanism to potentially avoid pitfalls, or help you navigate around walls.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Always think ahead. Consider the implications of each move, as interacting with certain sprites might lead to losing vital assets or invalidating your path.\n\n6. **Watch for Score Changes:**\n   - Keep track of score changes when interacting with various elements to assess the benefits of specific actions.\n\nBy following these strategies and being mindful of your interactions and the environment, you can successfully navigate through the levels and achieve the goal efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
