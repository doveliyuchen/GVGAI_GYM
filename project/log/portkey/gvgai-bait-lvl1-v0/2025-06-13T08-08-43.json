The emphasis on interactions, limited movement (implied by \"stepBack\"), and specific win/loss conditions points to a puzzle-solving experience.  The level layout further suggests a constrained environment where spatial reasoning is key.\n\n**Objective:**  The goal is to get the avatar to the \"goal\" sprite while carrying the \"key\".\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an \"avatar\". The game world seems to have impassable \"wall\" objects that the avatar can't pass.\n*   **Key Collection:**  The \"nokey\" sprite (presumably the avatar initially) needs to find and pick up a \"key\".  Collecting the key transforms the \"nokey\" into a \"withkey\" sprite. The avatar can also be changed to the \"withkey\" by colliding with the key item.\n*   **Goal Interaction:** The \"withkey\" sprite can interact with the \"goal\" sprite to open it.\n*   **Obstacles:** \"hole\" sprites are instant death.  \"box\" sprites can be pushed, but seem to interact with the environment, including the \"wall\" and \"mushroom\" objects.\n*   **Box Pushing:** The \"box\" can be pushed by the avatar, but is not pushed past walls.\n\n**Win Condition:** The game is won when all \"goal\" sprites are removed from the level (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0). This implies the player needs to reach and \"open\" all goals.\n\n**Loss Condition:** The game is lost when all \"avatar\" sprites are removed from the level (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0). This likely means the player avatar has died, probably by falling into a hole.\n\n**Key Interactions:**\n\n*   **Avatar + Wall:**  Avatar cannot pass through a wall.\n*   **Avatar + Hole:**  Game over.\n*   **Avatar + Key:** The avatar collects the key and can progress.\n*   **WithKey + Goal:** Goal is opened when the avatar has the key.\n*   **Avatar + Mushroom:** Score change of 1 and avatar dies.\n*   **Box + Hole:** Creates score increase.\n*   **Box + Wall + Box + Mushroom:** Undoes all actions, essentially a reset.\n\n**Possible Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key Acquisition:** Find and collect the key as the first priority. This transforms the avatar to \"withkey\".\n2.  **Hole Avoidance:**  Carefully navigate the level, avoiding all \"hole\" sprites.\n3.  **Goal Navigation:** Once you have the key, carefully navigate to the \"goal\" sprites.\n4.  **Box Manipulation:**  Use the \"box\" sprites to strategically access areas or as a bridge. Be careful not to push boxes into dead ends. The box appears to be a crucial element for solving the puzzle because pushing it into a hole gives a score increase.\n5.  **Mushroom Avoidance:** Mushrooms are always bad.\n6.  **Abuse undoAll:** If necessary, abuse the box wall box mushroom interaction to undo and try alternative paths\n\n**In essence, this is a Sokoban-like puzzle game with added elements like the key and the dangerous holes. Planning moves carefully and thinking ahead are crucial for success.**\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
