    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules and mechanics, this game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. The player controls an avatar that must navigate through a grid-based level while avoiding hazards and interacting with various objects to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different sprites represent the avatar, keys, goal, walls, and interactable objects.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the grid, with specific interactions based on what it encounters.\n- **Interactions**: The game has a series of defined interactions:\n  - The avatar can collide with walls and holes, resulting in either stepping back or dying.\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes, which plays a role in navigation and puzzle-solving. \n  - Collecting a key transforms the avatar and allows it to access the goal.\n  - Some items and conditions affect the score.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the **goal** (the closed door) by navigating through the level, avoiding hazards, and collecting a **key** while ensuring that the avatar remains alive.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game if the goal is reached and there are no goal sprites left (`SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar sprite count reaches zero (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0`).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of walls and holes which can lead to losing the game.\n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**: Use boxes to bounce forward and navigate the level; they can interact with other sprites, facilitating movement and problem-solving.\n3. **Collect the Key**: The key is essential. Ensure you collect it after interacting with the `nokey` sprite (transform to `withkey`).\n4. **Reach the Goal**: Once you have the key, navigate to the goal (the closed door) to complete the level. Be cautious of being in the `nokey` state near the goal as it will set you back.\n5. **Plan the Route**: Since the game features a grid layout with walls, plan your moves strategically to avoid getting stuck or trapped.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe gameplay revolves around problem-solving and strategic movement, making the player's decisions crucial to reaching the goal while staying alive. Understanding interactions and planning the right sequence of moves is key to successfully completing levels.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
