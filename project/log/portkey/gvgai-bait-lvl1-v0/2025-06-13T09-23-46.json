    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's my analysis of the game based on the provided rules:\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle Game\n\n**Objective:** Collect the key, then reach the goal while carrying the key. Bonus points can be scored by pushing blocks into holes and collecting mushrooms.\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar (`MovingAvatar`).\n*   **Key Collection/Transformation:** The player starts as `nokey`. Touching a `key` transforms the avatar into `withkey`, indicating they are carrying the key.\n*   **Obstacles:**\n    *   `wall`: Impassable.\n    *   `hole`: Deadly.\n    *   `box`: Pushable, but blocks movement.\n    *   `mushroom`: Scores points and kills the sprite when collected by the avatar.\n*   **Pushing Boxes:** The player can push boxes.\n*   **Goal Interaction:** The player can only pass through the goal while carrying the key (`withkey`).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** All `goal` sprites are removed from the level (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0). This implies there might be multiple goals in some levels, though the provided level layout only has one.\n*   **Loss:** All `avatar` sprites are removed from the level (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0). This happens when the avatar falls into a `hole`.\n\n**Key Sprites and Their Roles:**\n\n*   `avatar` (`nokey`, `withkey`): The player-controlled character. The state (`nokey` vs. `withkey`) determines interaction with the `goal`.\n*   `key`: Transforms the `avatar` into the `withkey` state.\n*   `goal`: The exit. Only accessible with the key.\n*   `box`: A movable block used to solve puzzles, for example, pushing it into a hole.\n*   `hole`: A hazard that instantly eliminates the avatar. Can be filled with boxes.\n*   `mushroom`: An obstacle that grants a small score when collected.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Collection:** The first step is always to find and collect the `key` to transform the avatar into `withkey`.\n2.  **Avoid Holes:** Falling into a `hole` results in immediate failure, so careful navigation is crucial.\n3.  **Box Manipulation:** Use `box` sprites to:\n    *   Fill `hole` sprites for safe passage.\n    *   Potentially create paths or block off areas.\n    *   Avoid getting boxed in.\n4.  **Plan Ahead:** Due to the limited movement and the presence of pushable blocks, think several steps ahead to avoid getting stuck or blocking your own path.\n5.  **Optional: Collect Mushrooms:** If safe and accessible, collect `mushroom` sprites for score.\n6.  **Reach the Goal:** Once you have the key, navigate to the `goal` to win the level.\n\n**Specific Notes on the Provided Level Layout:**\n\n*   The level is small, suggesting a relatively simple puzzle.\n*   'A' represents the avatar's starting position.\n*   'k' represents the key's position.\n*   'g' represents the goal's position.\n*   '0' represents the box's position.\n*   '1' represents the mushrooms' positions.\n\nThe player likely needs to first get the key to the south, then navigate around the central boxes to reach the goal at the north. The mushrooms are located on the opposite sides of the starting position.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
