This is confirmed by the condition that the SpriteCounter for the goal reaches zero.\n- The player loses if the avatar sprite limit reaches zero, which occurs when the avatar dies from falling into holes or colliding with harmful sprites.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Maximize Exploration:**\n   - Explore the level methodically. The layout suggests several routes to obtain the key while avoiding hazards like holes and mushrooms.\n\n2. **Key Acquisition:**\n   - Collect the key as soon as possible. Transforming from nokey to withkey is critical for reaching the goal.\n\n3. **Pace Yourself:**\n   - Use the bouncing mechanic effectively when interacting with boxes. This could provide an advantage in positioning your avatar and avoiding falling into holes.\n\n4. **Avoid Dangerous Sprites:**\n   - Be mindful of your movements near mushrooms and holes, as they can lead to losing your avatar. Always plan your movement ahead.\n\n5. **Score Optimization:**\n   - If scoring is essential, prioritize mushroom collection when it's safe to do so (without risking your avatar's life).\n\n6. **Plan Your Exit:**\n   - Before heading towards the goal, ensure you are in the withkey state. Approach the goal carefully to avoid backtracking unnecessarily.\n\nBy following these strategic suggestions and understanding the game mechanics and objectives, players can effectively navigate the challenges presented in this level and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
