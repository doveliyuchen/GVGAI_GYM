The use of sprites like avatars, keys, and goals, along with wall interactions, suggests a focus on strategic movement and problem-solving.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as walls, holes, keys, boxes, mushrooms, and goals. These sprites have specific behaviors and interactions that define the gameplay.\n2. **Movement**: The avatar can move around the level but is limited in its interactions. The player will need to navigate around obstacles and interact with other sprites.\n3. **Interactions**: The avatar has specific interactions with each sprite:\n   - **Walls**: Stepping into a wall causes the avatar to step back.\n   - **Holes**: Falling into a hole results in the avatar's loss (game over).\n   - **Boxes**: Bouncing off boxes can be used strategically. \n   - **Keys**: The avatar can transform when collecting keys, which unlocks new functionalities.\n   - **Goals**: To win, the player must reach the goal while possessing a key.\n   - **Mushrooms**: Touching mushrooms may penalize the player by losing a life or score.\n\n4. **Score System**: The player can earn score points by interacting positively with other elements (like collecting keys or avoiding danger).\n\n#### Game Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal sprite (the door) after acquiring a key. The player must navigate the level effectively, avoid holes, and manage other sprites to successfully reach the goal with the key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game when there are no remaining goal sprites with the avatar reaching the goal equipped with a key.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's sprite reaches the limit of 0, which implies the avatar interacts negatively with a hole or falls into one.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Assess the level layout before making moves. Identify the location of the key and the goal.\n   \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of holes and mushrooms to prevent losing lives. Use walls strategically to guide your movements back to safety.\n\n3. **Interact Wisely**: Use boxes to bounce around obstacles or to move towards the goal while ensuring you have the key.\n\n4. **Collect the Key**: Make a priority to transform from the 'nokey' avatar to the 'withkey' avatar by collecting the key as soon as possible. This is essential to progress towards the goal.\n\n5. **Strategic Movement**: Move around the edges of the level when possible to minimize danger from walls and holes. If you encounter obstacles, think one step ahead about how the interaction will play out.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Be aware of score mechanics. Collect items that enhance your score, which may help in any potential ranking or scoring system in the game.\n\nBy understanding these rules and strategizing accordingly, players can navigate the levels and ultimately reach their objectives effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
