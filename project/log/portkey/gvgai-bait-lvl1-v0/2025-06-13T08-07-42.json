You achieve this by finding the 'key' and using it to transform your avatar to 'withkey', then reaching the goal. A secondary objective seems to be pushing boxes into holes.\n\n**Sprites and Their Roles:**\n\n*   **Avatar (A):** The player-controlled character (starts as 'nokey').\n*   **Floor (.):** The walkable area.\n*   **Wall (w):** Impassable obstacle. Uses autotiling for visual appeal.\n*   **Hole (0):** Destroys the avatar or boxes.\n*   **Nokey:** The avatar WITHOUT the key.\n*   **Withkey:** The avatar WITH the key, capable of opening the goal.\n*   **Mushroom (1):** Destroys the avatar for a point.\n*   **Key (k):** Transforms the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey'.\n*   **Goal (g):** The exit door, requires the avatar to have the key.\n*   **Box:** Pushable object that can be used to fill holes.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The avatar moves around the level.\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar can push boxes. Pushing boxes into walls, boxes or mushrooms will undo the last action.\n*   **Transformation:** Collecting a key transforms the avatar's sprite.\n*   **Death:** Avatar dies upon entering a hole or touching a mushroom.\n\n**Win Condition:** All 'goal' sprites must be removed (SpriteCounter limit=0). This implies you need to open all the doors.\n**Loss Condition:** All 'avatar' sprites must be removed (SpriteCounter limit=0). This happens if the avatar falls into a hole or touches a mushroom.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n*   +1 point for pushing a box into a hole.\n*   +5 points for opening the goal with the key.\n*   +1 points for touching a mushroom\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Find the Key:** Prioritize getting the key.\n2.  **Avoid Hazards:** Carefully navigate to avoid falling into holes or touching mushrooms.\n3.  **Box Placement:** Plan box pushes strategically. Use boxes to fill holes if necessary. Be careful not to trap yourself or block the key/goal.\n4.  **Open the Goal:** Once you have the key ('withkey' avatar), head for the goal.\n5.  **Solve the Puzzle:** The level layout suggests a Sokoban-style puzzle where you need to manipulate the boxes to create a path or overcome obstacles.\n\nIn essence, this game appears to be a blend of Sokoban-style box-pushing with key-collecting and hazard avoidance. Careful planning and execution of box movements are likely crucial to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
