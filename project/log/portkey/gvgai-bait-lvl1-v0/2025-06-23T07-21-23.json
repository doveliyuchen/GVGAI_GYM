    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle-platformer** genre. It combines elements of both puzzle-solving and platforming, likely requiring players to navigate a series of challenges using environmental elements.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites that serve different roles:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can move around the level.\n   - **Key**: A collectible item essential for interacting with the goal door.\n   - **Goal Door**: The endpoint that needs to be reached with a \"key\" to win.\n   - **Obstacles**: Walls and holes hinder movement and can lead to death if the avatar falls into a hole.\n   - **Boxes**: These can bounce the avatar and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Mushrooms**: Interacting with these leads to scoring but kills the avatar.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game allows for a variety of interactions:\n   - The avatar can step back from walls and holes but dies if it falls into a hole.\n   - Collecting a key transforms the avatar, allowing it to interact with the goal door.\n   - Boxes can be used to propel the avatar forward, but they are also subject to specific interactions with walls and mushrooms.\n\n3. **Scoring System**: Collectibles like mushrooms and hole interactions can affect scoring and avatar status, influencing the game's overall strategy.\n\n### Objectives\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal door (to win) with the key. The player\u2019s secondary objective is to avoid dying (which results in loss) while navigating through the level.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the goal door is reached with the key (score change of 5 points).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's counter reaches zero (the avatar dies).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Plan Movement**: Since the avatar can die from falling into holes, plan each move carefully. Avoid jumping directly into holes or off edges without knowing the surroundings.\n\n2. **Collect Key First**: As the avatar starts without a key, ensure that the key is collected before attempting to reach the goal door.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Utilize boxes to bounce towards hard-to-reach areas but be mindful of how they interact with walls and mushrooms. Avoid unnecessary interactions that might lead to avatar death.\n\n4. **Avoid Mushrooms Initially**: Given that interacting with mushrooms leads to avatar death, it\u2019s best to navigate around them until you have obtained the key and are clear about your path to the goal.\n\n5. **Explore the Level**: Before attempting to reach the goal, explore areas to understand the placements of walls, holes, and the locations of the key and goal.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can maximize their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving the objective of reaching the goal with the key intact.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",

    "content": "Based on the current game state and the described mechanics, here\u2019s my analysis:\n\n1. **Avatar Position and Nearby Entities**:\n   - The avatar's position is not explicitly mentioned, but it is crucial to know where the avatar currently is regarding the key and the goal door for decision-making.\n   - The goal door (represented by `#`) is located at (1, 6).\n   - The key (represented by `%`) is located at (7, 6).\n\n2. **Available Actions**:\n   - Players can move LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, or UP but need to be cautious not to move into holes (represented by `$`) or directly towards walls (represented by `*`).\n   - The presence of boxes (`@`) offers potential bounce and movement options, but we should focus on reaching the key first.\n\n3. **Observing Strategies**:\n   - To win, it is essential to first collect the key before reaching the goal door.\n   - The avatar should explore the vicinity carefully, avoiding obstacles like mushrooms (`m`) or holes (`$`), which may lead to immediate death.\n\nGiven that the specifics of the avatar's position are not provided, let's assume a possible default starting position.\n\nTo create a meaningful action, I will take the strategy of moving towards where the key is located (7, 6). If I\u2019m below or at the same row level with the key, moving downmakes sense to reach it.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action expects to move down potentially towards the direction of the key while being aware of the environment. If it aligns with the strategy of collecting the key first, I could then proceed to move towards the goal door.",
