    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to fit into the **puzzle platformer** genre. Players control an avatar within a defined space, avoiding hazards while solving puzzles, to achieve objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites that players can interact with\u2014including walls, a key, a goal, holes, mushrooms, and boxes.\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include walls, the floor, and the goal (closed door), which remain static throughout the level.\n   - **Moving Avatar**: The player's character can navigate the environment, but may be hindered by walls and hazards.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: Items like keys and boxes can be interacted with to influence gameplay, while mushrooms and holes pose threats.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can lose health or lives when coming into contact with certain sprites (holes, mushrooms).\n   - The avatar can interact with boxes to bounce back, and keys can transform the avatar from a state of not having a key (nokey) to having a key (withkey).\n   - The goal can only be accessed when the avatar is transformed into the state with the key.\n\n3. **Scoring System**: \n   - Collecting keys and certain interactions with holes and mushrooms lead to score changes.\n   - Winning is tied to successfully reaching the goal, specifically when carrying a key.\n\n#### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to reach the goal while solving puzzles and collecting items (keys) that allow progression. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all goal sprites are eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0), indicating that the player has reached the goal with the key.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the number of avatars reaches zero (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0), suggesting that the player has run out of lives or health.\n\n### Level Layout\nThe provided level layout indicates the positioning of the elements:\n- **Walls** (w) create barriers.\n- **Goal** (g) is positioned in a way that is likely accessible only with the key.\n- The avatar (A) starts at a specific point, and the key (k) is located in a strategic but somewhat challenging location.\n- Blocks and holes are arrayed to create potential traps or obstacles.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Learn the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the layout and the location of walls, holes, keys, and the goal.\n\n2. **Careful Movement**: Avoid falling into holes and contact with mushrooms, as they may result in penalties or avatar loss.\n\n3. **Key Collection**: Prioritize reaching the key. Transforming your avatar to \"withkey\" status is critical for accessing the goal.\n\n4. **Utilize Boxes**: Use boxes strategically to bounce away from walls and navigate tight spaces more effectively. Be cautious of their proximity to holes to avoid unnecessary deaths.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path**: Before moving, consider potential consequences of each action\u2014particularly interactions with the wall, key, mushroom, and goal.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Aim for maximizing scores through strategic interactions, especially the key and goal combination (killSprite with scoreChange).\n\nFollowing these strategies can help you navigate through levels efficiently, avoid detrimental interactions, and achieve your objectives successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
