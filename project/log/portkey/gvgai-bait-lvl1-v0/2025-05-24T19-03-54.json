Players must navigate the levels while solving puzzles and avoiding hazards to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n  - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move around the environment.\n  - **Walls**: Barriers that prevent movement in certain directions, causing the avatar to bounce back if encountered.\n  - **Holes**: Instantly kill the avatar if they move into one.\n  - **Boxes and Mushrooms**: Objects that interact with the avatar and each other in various ways, resulting in movement and score changes.\n  - **Keys**: Items that transform the avatar into a different state (with key) and are crucial for opening goals.\n  - **Goals**: Represent the exit or completion point that requires the avatar to have a key to open.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary goal is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while having the \"withkey\" sprite activated to score points and progress through levels. \n- Players must avoid hazards like holes and mushrooms that can cause death, losing the game if the avatar is killed.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - Reach the \"goal\" sprite while transformed to \"withkey\" (transforming from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" by interacting with the key).\n  \n- **Loss Condition**: \n  - The game ends if the avatar is killed (encounters a hole or a mushroom), resulting in a failure to progress.\n\n#### Strategy Recommendations\n1. **Movement and Exploration**: \n   - Carefully explore the level to avoid holes. Use walls and other sprites to navigate safely.\n  \n2. **Utilizing Boxes**:\n   - Leverage the interaction between boxes, the avatar, and walls. Bounce off boxes strategically to avoid deadly sprites and clear paths.\n  \n3. **Key Management**:\n   - Ensure that you interact with the key before trying to reach the goal. The transformation to \"withkey\" is necessary for opening doors.\n  \n4. **Score Optimization**:\n   - Consider how to utilize interactions with mushrooms or holes for scoring without compromising safety. For instance, if there's a safe way to reach one of those that results in score change, utilize that.\n  \n5. **Planning Your Path**:\n   - Prioritize planning a route to ensure you can gather necessary items (key and potentially the box) and make progress toward the goal without getting into a deadlocked situation with hazards.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**:\n   - If possible, use trial and error to learn from past mistakes in proposals, especially regarding how the avatar interacts with different sprites.\n\nIn summary, approach the game methodically, tracking interactions and maintaining awareness of potential hazards as you seek the key to reach the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",

The nearest box (\"@\") is at (4,2) and (4,10).\n\n### Analyzing the Avatar's Options:\n1. The avatar must first collect the key at (7,6) to change its state from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\".\n2. The goal can only be reached once the avatar has the key. \n\n### Safe Navigation:\nConsidering the position of the avatar relative to hazards:\n- Rows (3,5) contain \"hole\" sprites at (5,6) and (6,6) that can cause immediate failure if the avatar moves into them.\n- Avoiding holes is paramount for survival as they are instant loss conditions.\n\nGiven the layout, the safest navigation is to move downward (to (3,1)), considering there are only walls on the sides to block the way, no immediate hazards, and pathways open for further movement toward the key.\n\n### Decision:\nTo initiate movement toward the key, the reasonable first action is to move down to (3,1) as the avatar needs to navigate safely first.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down opens the path and maintains safe distance from hazards while tracking towards collecting the key.",
