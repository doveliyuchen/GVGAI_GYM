Players control an avatar that navigates a level filled with obstacles, items, and interactive elements that require strategic thinking to solve.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites, each with specific functions:\n  - **Floor and Walls**: Act as boundaries.\n  - **Holes**: Represent hazards that can lead to losing the game if the avatar falls into them.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character that moves through the level.\n  - **Key and Goal**: The objective is to collect the key and reach the goal to win.\n  - **Box and Mushroom**: Items that can interact with the avatar and other sprites, affecting movement and status.\n  \n- **Interactions**:\n  - Moving against walls causes the avatar to step back.\n  - Falling into holes results in the avatar's destruction.\n  - Boxes can bounce the avatar forward and can interact with the goal and mushrooms negatively.\n  - Keys transform the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey,\" allowing access to the goal.\n  - Collecting mushrooms gains points but can also lead to losing the avatar if not handled carefully.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to collect the **key** and reach the **goal** (door) while avoiding hazards (holes and mushrooms). The player needs to navigate the level successfully without losing all avatars.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all goal sprites are collected (SpriteCounter for goals reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if all avatar sprites are destroyed (SpriteCounter for avatars reaches 0).\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level, including where the key and goal are placed relative to hazards and walls.\n\n2. **Collect the Key**: The first priority should be to reach the **key**. This allows you to transform from the **nokey** avatar to the **withkey** avatar, which is crucial for accessing the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious of **holes** and **mushrooms**. Try to navigate around these hazards as falling into a hole or coming into contact with a mushroom will eliminate your avatar.\n\n4. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Boxes can be utilized to manage space in the level. Use them to bounce away from walls or even position them to avoid falling into holes.\n\n5. **Check Each Move**: Each action matters, especially interacting with the environment. For example, carefully consider how the avatar interacts with boxes and walls to avoid unintended consequences.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path**: Before making moves, outline a potential path leading from the start point to the goal, considering obstacles.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can enhance their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving the game\u2019s objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",

    "content": "To begin interpreting the game state and determine the next action, I need to first analyze the current position of the avatar, which is represented by '&' at (5, 7), as well as the locations of the available items: the key represented by '%' at (6, 6) and the goal represented by '#' at (1, 6). \n\nAccording to the rules:\n1. The avatar currently does not hold the key and is in the \"nokey\" state.\n2. The avatar needs to collect the key at (6, 6) to move to the \"withkey\" state before reaching the goal at (1, 6).\n3. Hazards are present as certain tiles like '$' (holes) are positioned at (5, 6) and (6, 6), which require caution when navigating.\n\n### Next Steps\nSince the goal is to collect the key located at (6, 6), the avatar must move downwards (ACTION_DOWN) from its current position (5, 7) to (6, 7).\n\nHowever, moving down to (6, 7) leads to a hazard (holes) at (6, 6) where the key is also located. Therefore, I should consider an alternative direction to avoid falling into a hole while aiming to collect the key. Based on the rules, the safest course is to move left to (5, 6) followed by down to (6, 6) to ensure the collection of the key.\n\nThus, my first action will be to **move left to (5, 6)**. \n\n### Decision\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this action to position the avatar safely next to the key, allowing me to make a subsequent move to collect it on the following turn, avoiding any hazards.",
