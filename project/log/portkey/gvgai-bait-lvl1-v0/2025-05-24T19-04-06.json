Players control a moving avatar in a grid-based environment filled with obstacles, enemies, and interactive objects. The goal is to navigate through the level to achieve a specific objective while avoiding death and solving puzzles.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move around the grid.\n2. **Obstacles**: There are immovable blocks (walls, holes, mushrooms) that affect movement.\n3. **Collectibles and Key Mechanic**:\n   - **Keys**: Players must collect a key to unlock the goal.\n   - **Goals**: To complete the level, players need to reach the goal with the key.\n4. **Interactions**:\n   - Interacting with walls causes the avatar to step back.\n   - Colliding with a hole results in the avatar's death.\n   - Colliding with boxes bounces the avatar forward.\n   - Certain interactions can result in scoring points or transforming the avatar.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the goal (represented by the \"goal\" sprite) with the key in hand while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The player must navigate through the level, collect the key, and then reach the goal to win.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they manage to reach and interact with the goal while possessing the key. This is represented by the \"goal withkey\" interaction, which grants a score increase and completes the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's count reaches zero (indicating the avatar has died). This can occur if the player falls into holes or interacts with mushrooms that kill the avatar.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Familiarization**: Understand the layout of the level before making moves. Laying out paths and potential interactions in advance can help in planning your route.\n  \n2. **Collect the Key**: Prioritize finding and collecting the key as it is necessary to unlock the goal. Avoid interactions that may lead to losing the avatar before collecting it.\n  \n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious around holes and mushrooms. Plan your movements carefully to avoid situations where the avatar could be killed.\n  \n4. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Leverage the box mechanics to bounce forward or create safe pathways. If boxes are adjacent to holes, move them strategically to ensure safe routes.\n  \n5. **Clear Path to Goal**: Once the key is collected, ensure that you can access the goal without backtracking unnecessarily. Consider the avatar's movements carefully to avoid wall collisions and potential hazards near the goal.\n\n6. **Score maximizing**: If you wish to increase your score, try to interact with mushrooms before reaching the goal, as they add score when the avatar is killed.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the level while minimizing the risk of losing the avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",
