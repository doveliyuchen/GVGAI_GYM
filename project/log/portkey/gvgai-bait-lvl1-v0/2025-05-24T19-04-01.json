The objective revolves around solving spatial challenges with strategic movement and interactions with various elements in the environment.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - The game includes various static and dynamic sprites like the 'avatar', 'hole', 'goal', 'key', and 'box'.\n   - The 'avatar' is controlled by the player and can move around the level, while other sprites have specific interactions with the avatar, such as:\n     - The avatar bounces off walls and boxes.\n     - Falling into a hole results in losing a life.\n     - Collecting a key transforms the avatar, giving it access to the goal.\n     - 'Mushroom' and 'hole' can kill the avatar or boxes depending on their interaction.\n\n2. **Objectives:**\n   - The primary objective is to reach the goal (the closed door) while avoiding hazards.\n   - To unlock the goal, the player must obtain a key, transitioning the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey'.\n   - Collecting or interacting with specific sprites also yields score changes, adding an element of reward for exploration.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - The player wins by eliminating all instances of the goal sprite (which presumably means reaching it with the key).\n   - The player loses if the avatar sprite is eliminated (by falling into a hole, for instance).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Explore First:**\n   - Start by exploring the level to understand the layout and locate the key and goal. Note how the box and the mushroom interact in their environments, as they may offer strategic opportunities.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Move the avatar to the location of the key while avoiding the dangers posed by holes and mushrooms. Once the key is obtained, the avatar transforms to 'withkey'.\n\n3. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - With the key in hand, navigate towards the goal. Be cautious of tiles or sections that might induce danger like holes or mushrooms.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Always navigate carefully around walls and take note of the potential pitfalls or traps like falling into the hole or being killed by the mushroom. Utilize the bouncing mechanic to your advantage to traverse the map while keeping an eye on potential hazards.\n\n5. **Score Management:**\n   - While the primary goal is to reach the exit, collecting score items may serve as a secondary objective. Keep track of your score and see if engaging with various objects can boost it.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can maximize their chances of successfully completing the level while avoiding unnecessary losses. Understanding sprite interactions thoroughly will also greatly enhance gameplay.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnokey floor -> 'A'\nhole floor -> '0'\nbox floor -> '1'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nmushroom floor -> 'm'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nkey -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> *\nrow=1, col=2 -> *\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> *\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> *\nrow=1, col=10 -> *\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> *\nrow=2, col=2 -> *\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> *\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> *\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> *\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> &\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> *\nrow=5, col=2 -> *\nrow=5, col=3 -> *\nrow=5, col=4 -> *\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> *\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> *\nrow=5, col=11 -> *\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> *\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> *\nrow=6, col=5 -> *\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> *\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> *\nrow=6, col=10 -> *\nrow=6, col=11 -> *\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> *\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> *\nrow=7, col=5 -> *\nrow=7, col=6 -> %\nrow=7, col=7 -> *\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> *\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *",

Moving Up would return to 'A' (nokey floor), Left leads to '.', and Right leads to another '@' (box), which does not help in collecting the key.\n\nA logical action to take that aligns with our strategy of collecting the key first is to move **Down**. This immediate exploration is crucial as collecting the key will facilitate enabling movement towards the goal afterwards.\n\nHence, I will perform the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is expected to allow the avatar to collect the key, which will transform its state and enable progressing towards the goal.",
