The player controls an avatar, navigating a grid-like environment filled with various interactive sprites, aiming to achieve specific goals through manipulation of these elements.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Different types of sprites are present, including immovable walls and floor tiles, blocks, boxes (which can change state), and a moving avatar. Each sprite type has unique properties, such as behavior and interactions.\n- **Avatar Movement:** The avatar can move and interact with the environment, but it cannot pass through walls.\n- **Interactions:** The avatar can interact with boxes to bounce forward, and various combinations of boxes can transform into different colored blocks, earning the player points. However, if the avatar steps into a hole, it results in a penalty of -1 score.\n  \n**Objective:**\nTo win the game, the player must eliminate all boxes from the environment while ensuring that the score remains favorable (not allowing broken boxes to accumulate and reducing penalties). The game ends with a win condition when the box counter reaches zero.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - All boxes must be eliminated (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches zero).\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar is \"killed\" (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n  - One or more broken boxes exist (MultiSpriteCounter for broken boxes reaches 1).\n  - The game times out (timeout limit of 1500).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Moves Carefully:** Each move should be calculated to avoid stepping into holes, as this results in a score penalty. Keeping track of your score is crucial.\n2. **Utilize Color Transformation:** Make use of the interaction mechanics between boxes and colored blocks strategically to increase your score. Transforming boxes into blocks earns points, which can be favorable in case penalties occur later.\n3. **Avoid Broken Boxes:** Monitor the situation closely to avoid allowing too many broken boxes to accumulate, as they lead to a loss condition. Utilize the interaction patterns to transfer boxes into broken boxes if they must be disposed of strategically.\n4. **Create Paths:** Use boxes to create paths or bounce back into advantageous positions when necessary, particularly if surrounded by walls or imminent danger from holes.\n5. **Use Time Wisely:** Since there's a timeout limit, act decisively to clear levels\u2014plan ahead and ensure each action contributes towards eliminating boxes or gaining score-related advantages.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can effectively navigate the puzzle, work towards achieving their goals, and potentially win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> a\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, let's first identify the position of the avatar and nearby entities:\n\n- The avatar (`a`) is currently located at (5, 6).\n- Surrounding the avatar at (5, 6), we have:\n  - (5, 5): Empty space (`.`)\n  - (5, 7): Blue box (`#`)\n  - (5, 8): Hole (`$`)\n\nThe immediate threat to the avatar is the hole directly to the right (5, 8). Moving into this hole would result in a penalty, which we want to avoid.\n\nGiven this positioning, the potential actions from (5, 6) involve only moving left (to (5, 5)), right (to (5, 7) where the blue box is), down (to (6, 6), which is also empty), and up (to (4, 6), also empty). \n\nTo minimize risk and adhere to the strategy of planning moves carefully and maximizing score, the best action would be to interact with the box located at (5, 7) to the right. Since interacting there ensures continued clearing of the boxes and avoids stepping into the hole, I will choose:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action moves the avatar right to (5, 7), where it interacts with the box. My expectation is that this action will help progress towards clearing the boxes while ensuring no penalties are incurred from stepping into a hole.",
