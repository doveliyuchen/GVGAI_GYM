It includes elements typical of puzzle-solving, navigating through a grid-based layout while interacting with different block types and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Objects**: The game features various movable and immovable sprites including the player (avatar), blocks (colored boxes), walls, holes, and different states of boxes (e.g., broken box).\n- **Movement**: The avatar moves around the level while interacting with blocks and walls, which influences its position and the state of other blocks.\n- **Interactions**: Specific interactions include:\n  - The avatar bouncing off boxes.\n  - Transforming specific colored boxes into block types that may grant points.\n  - Undoing interactions based on combinations of box types.\n  - Hazards: Falling into a hole results in losing points and potentially failing the level.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to clear all 'box' sprites from the level before the timeout runs out. The avatar must maneuver and interact with various blocks to achieve this. \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: You win by eliminating all 'box' sprites from the game.\n- **Loss Conditions**: You suffer a loss if:\n  - The avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter reaches zero).\n  - A 'brokenbox' sprite appears on the field.\n  - The time runs out (reaches limit).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understanding Block Transformations**: Leverage the interactions between different box types wisely. For example, transforming 'bluebox' to 'blueblock' grants points that can be beneficial. \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious of the holes in the level, as falling in will lead to penalties and potentially a loss condition.\n3. **Plan Moves**: Calculate your movements to avoid pushing boxes into walls or other boxes, which can cause undesirable outcomes or undo beneficial actions.\n4. **Open Pathways**: Try to strategically clear pathways to access boxes more easily, especially towards the end of the level where box removal becomes critical.\n5. **Manage Time**: Keep an eye on the timer; your moves should be efficient enough to clear all boxes before time is up.\n6. **Utilize Power-ups**: Take advantage of the special block interactions to transform boxes and gain points, which may support your end goal.\n\nBy employing these strategies and carefully observing the block interactions, players can maximize their chances of achieving the winning condition while minimizing risks associated with the loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> a\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> &\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",
