Players control an avatar and must navigate through a grid-like environment to solve puzzles, manipulate blocks, and reach specific objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Different types of blocks and boxes (red, blue, green) that interact with the avatar in various ways.\n- **Movement:** The player controls the 'avatar' using movement commands, which interact with walls, blocks, and other objects on the screen.\n- **Transformations:** The game features a variety of interactions that allow certain boxes to transform into blocks, affecting the gameplay and scoring.\n- **Scoring:** Players earn points by transforming boxes into blocks (each successful transformation scores points). \n- **Interactions:** The avatar can bounce off boxes, step back from walls, and fall into holes (which results in a loss of points). \n- **Undo Mechanic:** Certain combinations of boxes can cause all involved boxes to revert to their original states (designated as \"undoAll\").\n- **Game Environment:** The level is bounded by walls, and players must navigate through open spaces marked by dots.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to eliminate all the active boxes (represented by numbers) by transforming them into blocks through interaction, thereby causing them to eventually disappear or be counted down. The avatar must avoid falling into holes and must efficiently interact with blocks and boxes to clear the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when all the boxes are transformed and eliminated from the screen.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The game ends unsuccessfully if the avatar is eliminated (sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0), if a broken box is transformed (which leads to failure), or if time runs out.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Assess the layout of boxes, their colors, and the walls. Plan a sequence of moves to ensure that you are maximizing interactions that lead to box transformations.\n\n2. **Utilize Bouncing:**\n   - Use the bouncing mechanic to your advantage when moving your avatar towards boxes. Ensure that you control the movement to guide boxes towards each other for transformation.\n\n3. **Manage Interactions Wisely:**\n   - Be strategic about which boxes to interact with at any point. Try to group boxes of the same color together to achieve transformations efficiently.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes and Wall Collisions:**\n   - Always keep an eye out for walls and holes. Colliding with walls results in setbacks and falling into holes results in point loss. Maintain a safe distance from these obstacles while working through the level.\n\n5. **Deal with Undo Mechanic:**\n   - Be cautious of the transformations that lead to the undo mechanic. Keeping track of when you might be set back by the undo and devising a way around it is crucial.\n\n6. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the time limit (1500 units). Optimize your movements to clear boxes quickly and avoid getting stuck, which could lead to a timeout loss.\n\nBy following these strategies and keeping the mechanics and objectives in mind, players can effectively navigate through the game's puzzles to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar ('a') is positioned at (row 6, col 8). The surroundings consist of several boxes and blocks which may be manipulated.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- There are two blue boxes at (row 2, col 3) and (row 2, col 4), and two red boxes at (row 2, col 8) and (row 4, col 10). \n- The avatar can interact with these boxes to transform them into blocks and earn points according to the objective. \n- It's essential to ensure that the avatar moves strategically to avoid falling into holes (notably the one at (row 5, col 8)).\n\n### Possible Actions:\nConsidering that the avatar's current position is surrounded by empty spaces in various directions, I need to decide on a suitable action. \n\nSince the avatar can move:\n- **Left (col 7)**: This would lead to an empty space, which is non-impactful.\n- **Right (col 9)**: This also leads to an empty space and doesn\u2019t assist in transformations.\n- **Up (row 5)** or **Down (row 7)**: Both options lead to empty spaces as well.\n\n### Selection of Action:\nConsidering there is no advantageous immediate action that leads to a box transformation due to all adjacent positions being empty, the avatar should try to move to an area with more potential interactions.\n\nThus, I will move the avatar **up** to check if it can assess potential new interactions from (row 5, col 8) or (row 5, col 7).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to explore new potential configurations while keeping it safe from the nearby hole below it.",
