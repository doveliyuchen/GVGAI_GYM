It involves movement, spatial reasoning, and interaction with various objects (sprites) to achieve a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites**: Different types of immovable and movable blocks, holes, walls, and an avatar (player character).\n- **Movement**: The avatar (player) can move and bounce off certain sprites but collision with walls results in a step back.\n- **Transformations**: Interactions between different blocks result in transformations. For example, a bluebox can transform into a blueblock, and certain combinations of colored boxes can undo previous transformations.\n- **Scoring**: Players can gain scores by transforming blocks and possibly lose scores by colliding with holes. \n- **Time Constraint**: There is a timer that limits playtime to 1500 ticks.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to eliminate all **boxes** (sprite type \"box\") by transforming them into broken boxes (sprite type \"brokenBox\"). \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the number of boxes reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is destroyed, if a broken box appears (indicating failure to manage boxes appropriately), or if the time runs out.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since the layout includes walls and holes, plan your moves carefully to avoid unnecessary collisions that could send you back or kill your avatar.\n\n2. **Utilize Bouncing**: Use boxes effectively to bounce off and create opportunities for transformations. Work towards the goal of turning boxes into the broken state which contributes to your win condition.\n\n3. **Manage Combinations**: Be mindful of the interactions between different colored boxes. Certain combinations undo your actions, which may set you back, so keep track of what you are carrying and the current state of the blocks.\n\n4. **Prioritize Box Usage**: Focus on eliminating boxes quickly as that is your main win condition. Every interaction with boxes that results in a transformation is crucial for progressing toward victory.\n\n5. **Monitor the Timer**: Keep an eye on the 1500-tick limit. Plan your moves to ensure that you\u2019re making progress toward the objective within this timeframe.\n\n6. **Avoid Holes**: Steer clear of holes since they cause the avatar to lose life and score. \n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can effectively navigate the mechanics and layout of the game to achieve the objective of eliminating all boxes before running out of time or losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",
