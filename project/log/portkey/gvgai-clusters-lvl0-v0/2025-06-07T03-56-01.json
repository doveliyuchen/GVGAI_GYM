    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Genre:\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle platformer** genre. It involves navigation through a grid-like environment where players must solve puzzles and obstacles to achieve objectives.\n\n### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Types**: The game features various immovable and movable sprites, including platforms (floor), hazards (hole), blocks (different colors), and an avatar. Each sprite has specific interactions that affect gameplay.\n- **Movement Interactions**: The avatar can interact with walls, blocks, and boxes. Upon collision with certain elements (like walls or holes), the avatar either steps back or perishes (in the case of the hole).\n- **Transformation**: Players can combine two blocks of the same type, which results in a transformation to score points, while combinations of different block types lead to reversing or negating previous actions.\n- **Box Mechanics**: Boxes can bounce the avatar forward and can change into a broken box if they fall into a hole.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to eliminate all boxes (referred to as \"box\") present in the level. This is indicated by the sprite counter for the box type reaching zero, which results in a win condition. Failure to manage the boxes or losing the avatar results in a loss.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The player wins if all boxes are removed from the level.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar counts drop to zero (suggests that the avatar can die), if a broken box exists (a failed sprite), or if time runs out after 1500 ticks.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movements**: Before taking actions with the avatar, think ahead about how movements will affect the environment. Certain blocks can undo previous actions, which can lead to wasted movements if not planned sequentially.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Box Management**: Focus on transforming or removing boxes strategically to reach the goal. Given the interactions, it may be beneficial to work on pairs of boxes of the same color first to gain easier control of the board.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards and Stepbacks**: Always be cautious of the wall and hole sprites that can either lead you to step back (wasted moves) or result in a game over (if hitting a hole).\n\n4. **Use Bouncing Effect**: Make effective use of the passive box sprite that can help bounce the avatar forward to navigate obstacles and control movements effectively.\n\n5. **Track Interactions**: Keep a mental or written note of the interactions that you perform, especially the combinations that lead to the undoing of your previous steps. This will help in avoiding backtracking unnecessarily.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Monitor the time limit closely to ensure that you are progressing towards completing the level without running out of moves or time.\n\nBy following these strategies and remaining cautious of interactable elements, players can navigate the puzzle effectively and reach the game's objectives with a greater chance of success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> #\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> &\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> a\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",

The surrounding elements include:\n\n- A red box (`&`) in (row 2, col 9) and (row 2, col 10).\n- Several other blocks and floors within the grid.\n\nThe immediate action options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, but we need to ensure that our avatar can navigate without hitting any obstacles, and we need to prioritize box management to achieve the objective of eliminating all boxes.\n\nSince the avatar is currently in a position with available spaces around, a strategic move would be to attempt to push or interact with a box. \n\nGiven that the only immediate interaction with the boxes would require moving towards them, and there's a box directly upwards at (row 7, col 3) which is empty (.) and can potentially be manipulated with the correct moves:\n\nThe next logical step is to move UP.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action will help me explore the upper section for potential box management or further interactions. I expect this aligns with the strategy of prioritizing box management.",
