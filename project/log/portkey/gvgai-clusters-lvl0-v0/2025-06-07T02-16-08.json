    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game appears to belong to the **puzzle** genre, incorporating elements of strategy and possibly platforming due to the avatar movement and interactions with various blocks and obstacles.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game features several types of sprites, including the player avatar, blocks of different colors, boxes, walls, and holes.\n- **Interactions:** The game involves multiple interactions based on the player avatar's position and movement:\n  - The avatar can bounce off boxes, step back from walls, or be harmed by holes (losing points).\n  - Blocks of the same color can transform into each other and provide score changes when manipulated.\n  - Different colored boxes can change into blocks, while boxes can also be transformed into broken boxes when they fall into holes.\n- **Movement:** The avatar moves through the environment while interacting with these objects, and strategic movement appears crucial.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The main objective is to eliminate all the boxes (indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`), transforming them as necessary to achieve the desired interactions.\n- A secondary objective is to avoid losing the avatar (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n- The player must navigate within a set time limit (`Timeout limit=1500 win=False`).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The player wins if all boxes are eliminated.\n- **Loss:** The player loses if the avatar is eliminated or if time runs out. Additionally, transforming a box into a 'broken box' is detrimental to winning.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Moves:** As the avatar, carefully plan each move to ensure optimal interactions with the boxes and blocks. Consider how colors change and which blocks can be transformed.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Box Management:** Focus on managing the boxes strategically. Aim to have multiple boxes interact to transform them into blocks of the same color for easier manipulation.\n   \n3. **Avoid Holes and Walls:** Be cautious of the holes which will eliminate the avatar and walls that cause setbacks. Map out a path that avoids unnecessary risks.\n   \n4. **Utilize Bouncing:** Use the bouncing feature of boxes effectively to manipulate their positions without causing harm to the avatar. Think several moves ahead to create beneficial configurations.\n   \n5. **Time Efficiency:** Keep track of the time limit. While strategizing, ensure that each action moves you closer to eliminating boxes without wasting turns.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can maximize their chances of successfully completing the game while avoiding pitfalls that lead to loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> @\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",

Therefore, repeating the desired action to move the avatar into action is necessary. Moving **up** would help to interact with the blue box directly above.\n\n### Expected Action\nI will choose to move the avatar **UP** to interact with the blue box above.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to position the avatar directly on the blue box to prepare for a possible transformation in the next turn.",
