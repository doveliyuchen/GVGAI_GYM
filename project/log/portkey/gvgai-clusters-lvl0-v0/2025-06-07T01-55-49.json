    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and layout, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fall into the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players navigate through levels, solving spatial puzzles and avoiding hazards to achieve a specific goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - Players control an **avatar** that can interact with various blocks and obstacles.\n   - There are **Immovable Sprites** (floor, wall, hole, regular blocks) and **Passive Sprites** (boxes) that change state when interacted with.\n   - The avatar can \"bounce\" off boxes and is killed by holes, losing points.\n   - Three types of blocks (blue, red, green) can transform when interacted with corresponding boxes, leading to a score change and possibly facilitating movement through the level.\n   - The concept of \"undoing\" interactions indicates the possibility of backtracking or correcting mistakes in block placement.\n\n2. **Goals and Scoring**:\n   - The primary objective is to ensure that all boxes are transformed or moved through the level.\n   - Winning requires the total removal of boxes (SpriteCounter limit for boxes must hit 0).\n   - Players can score points by transforming blocks and need to avoid the hole (which results in a score decrement).\n\n### Objective:\n- The main objective is to eliminate all **boxes** from the board.\n- The player must carefully navigate and manipulate objects to reach this goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning**: Achieved when the count of boxes reaches zero.\n- **Losing**: Occurs under the following conditions:\n  - The player's avatar is eliminated.\n  - One broken box exists on the field.\n  - Time runs out (1500 seconds).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before engaging, observe the layout. Decide the order in which you'll interact with boxes to prevent getting stuck. \n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Keep the avatar away from holes to maintain your score and avoid premature loss. \n\n3. **Utilize and Transform Blocks Wisely**: As blocks can transform into other types, manage these interactions to clear space for movement and positioning.\n\n4. **Incremental Progress**: Work to transform blocks step-by-step rather than trying to eliminate them all at once. Every score gained through transformations can act as a buffer if mistakes happen.\n\n5. **Watch for Backtrack Opportunities**: If a wrong move is made, adapt quickly. Use the ability to \"undo\" unnecessary or obstructive placements strategically.\n\n6. **Manage Time Effectively**: With a time limit in place, be aware of your progress relative to the clock and prioritize interactions that will lead to quicker box elimination.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can navigate through the levels more effectively and increase their chances of winning.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> a\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game map, your avatar (represented as 'a') is located at row 4, column 8. There are some boxes nearby: two green boxes (located at (2, 8) and (4, 10)), and several blue boxes scattered in the vicinity, which can be transformed.\n\nFollowing the strategy rules, here's the updated analysis:\n\n1. The avatar is surrounded by a variety of obstacles but can directly access the green box to the left.\n2. Transforming available boxes will help bring the box count down, which aligns with the scoring strategy.\n3. The nearby hole located at (5, 8) is a hazard that you must avoid, as falling into the hole will decrease your score and could lead to losing conditions if it results in your avatar being eliminated.\n\nGiven this, a logical move would be to interact with the green box (moving right towards column 9) so I can start the transformation process nearby to clear the level effectively.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves down and allows me to interact with the green box, facilitating my goal of eliminating boxes from the board, keeping the focus on avoiding hazards as outlined in the strategy.",
