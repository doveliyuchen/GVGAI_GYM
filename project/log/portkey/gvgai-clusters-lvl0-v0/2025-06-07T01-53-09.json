    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. It requires players to navigate a maze-like environment while interacting with various objects and sprites to solve puzzles.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: There are different sprites including walls, blocks, boxes, and your avatar, which can react in specific ways to one another. The avatar can move, while most other objects are immovable and act as barriers or aid in gameplay.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can interact with boxes and blocks, either bouncing off them, transforming them into new types, or performing other designated interactions. Certain combinations can lead to undoing actions, adding complexity to the gameplay.\n- **Environment**: The level is structured with walls that the avatar cannot pass through. Holes in the environment act as traps that cause the avatar to lose a life, while certain boxes can shrink or transform into broken boxes if falling into holes.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game can be summarized as follows:\n- **Win Condition**: To win, the player must eliminate all \"boxes\" (find a way to make the box sprites disappear).\n- **Scoring**: Interactions that transform boxes into block types can add to the player\u2019s score, suggesting that part of the strategy involves not just removal but also maximizing score throughout the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: When the count of the boxes reaches zero.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar is \"killed\" (interacts with a hole).\n  - Broken boxes exceed one in count.\n  - The time limit of 1500 runs out.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since moving the avatar can lead to various interactions, think several steps ahead. Predict how blocks will transform and plan moves accordingly.\n  \n2. **Manage Transformations**: Utilize boxes to transform into block types. Since transformations offer score incentives, focus on strategic placements of boxes to maximize their conversion into the desired blocks.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Always be aware of holes on the battlefield. Moving too close can lead to a 'kill' interaction, so strategically avoid areas that could trap your avatar.\n\n4. **Use Undo Mechanics Wisely**: The undo mechanic suggests that connections matter. If multiple boxes are combined or if missteps happen, leverage these to reset your strategy and test new approaches.\n\n5. **Pacing**: With a time limit, maintain a steady pace. Be strategic about when to take risks or reposition the avatar. Balancing speed and caution will be key to success.\n\n6. **Exploration and Exploitation**: Explore the level layout fully to identify possible interactions between boxes and blocks, examining how many transformations can happen in a single move.\n\nBy following these strategies and systematically navigating through the puzzle, players can work towards effectively eliminating all boxes while achieving the highest possible score within the provided time limit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nredblock -> '%'\nredbox -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> &\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> &\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=9, col=0 -> *\nrow=9, col=1 -> *\nrow=9, col=2 -> *\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> *\nrow=9, col=5 -> *\nrow=9, col=6 -> *\nrow=9, col=7 -> *\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> *\nrow=9, col=10 -> *\nrow=9, col=11 -> *\nrow=9, col=12 -> *",
