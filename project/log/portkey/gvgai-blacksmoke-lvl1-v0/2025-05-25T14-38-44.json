    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, the game can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer** genre with elements of exploration and resource management. \n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features several types of sprites, including:\n   - **Immovable Obstacles**: Such as walls, ground tiles, and locks.\n   - **Resources**: Collectibles like keys and shovels that have specific interactions and limits.\n   - **Spawn Points**: Which spawn smoke that provides a shield mechanic.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can interact with various elements in the game.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player can use the avatar to collect keys and shovels, which are essential for progressing through the game.\n   - Certain sprites provide barriers (walls) while others can be interacted with (e.g., locks that prevent or allow access depending on the resources collected).\n   - Smoke provides temporary invulnerability to a specific type of sprite (death) when interacted with.\n   - Interaction with the exit sprite allows the player to win the game.\n\n3. **Sprites' Constraints**:\n   - The avatar can carry only one key or shovel at a time.\n   - Interaction constraints (e.g., the lock kills the player if they have more than one key).\n\n### Objective:\n- The main objective is to reach the exit sprite, ensuring to manage resources like keys and shovels effectively to navigate through obstacles (e.g., locks, walls) while avoiding the 'death' sprite.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game upon interacting with the exit sprite while having defeated all obstructions.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar collides with the 'death' sprite or if the avatar is unable to progress due to resource constraints.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore Carefully**: As you navigate the level, always be aware of your surroundings to identify useful resources (keys and shovels) and potential hazards (locks and death).\n   \n2. **Resource Management**: Collect the key and shovel promptly, prioritizing them based on your immediate needs. Always have a plan on how to use these resources to advance (for example, unlocking a lock).\n\n3. **Use Smoke Wisely**: The smoke can provide valuable protection from the death sprite. Timing your interaction with smoke spawn points can allow you to maneuver through challenging areas safely.\n\n4. **Avoid Locks if Below Required Resources**: If carrying no key or already having the key, avoid locks to prevent instant death. \n\n5. **Plan Your Path**: Given the layout of the level, identify a clear path to the exit. You should recognize areas where you might need to backtrack or use specific resources before proceeding.\n\nBy leveraging exploration, resource management, and strategic planning, players can navigate the complex environment of the game to ultimately reach the exit and win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox death
