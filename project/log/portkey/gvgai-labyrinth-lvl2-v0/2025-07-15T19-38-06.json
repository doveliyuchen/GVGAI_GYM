Players navigate through a layout filled with various sprites, including walls, traps, and an exit.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes several types of sprites:\n   - **Floor**: The ground where the avatar can move.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers that block movement.\n   - **Traps**: Objects that, when collided with, result in a score deduction.\n   - **Exit**: The target object the player must reach to win the game.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that navigates the level.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can step back when hitting a wall.\n   - Successfully reaching the exit increases the score and allows for a win condition.\n   - Colliding with traps decreases the score and can ultimately lead to a loss if too many traps are hit.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level, avoiding traps and walls, and successfully reaching the exit door (green door sprite) to win. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - The player wins by reaching the exit, which leads to a score change of +1, resulting in victory.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player loses if the avatar's score reaches 0 due to hitting traps (score change of -1 per hit).\n  - The game ends in loss if the time limit of 1000 units is reached without reaching the exit.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the layout before moving. Determine potential routes to the exit while identifying trap locations. Avoid paths that lead directly to traps.\n\n2. **Exploration**: Move cautiously and explore the mazes. If possible, map out the accessible paths to keep track of the safe routes.\n\n3. **Positioning**: Utilize walls for protection against traps. If you encounter a dead end or the wall, step back to re-evaluate your path.\n\n4. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Make sure to move efficiently to avoid running out of time while still being cautious about traps.\n\n5. **Trap Avoidance**: Prioritize careful movement as hitting traps will increase the risk of losing. If you encounter a trap, reconsider your strategy or path and try to find alternative routes to the exit without hitting more traps.\n\nBy applying the above strategy, players can optimize their chances of successfully navigating through the maze and reaching the exit while minimizing score loss from traps.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit -> '@'\ntrap -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> $\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> $\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> $\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> #\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> $\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> $\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> $\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> $\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> $\nrow=9, col=8 -> a\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> $\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> $\nrow=9, col=14 -> $\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> $\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=10 -> $\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> $\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> $\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> $\nrow=12, col=10 -> $\nrow=12, col=11 -> $\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> $\nrow=12, col=14 -> $\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",
