The main ones include:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character, represented by the 'avatar' sprite.\n   - **George**: A chaser sprite that threatens the player by attempting to catch them.\n   - **Citizens**: Passive NPCs represented as sprites, which can interact with the game's mechanics.\n   - **Annoyed and Quiet NPCs**: Different states of NPCs that can impact gameplay based on player interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can kill George, leading to a score decrease.\n   - George transforms into Annoyed when it interacts with a Quiet character.\n   - Annoyed characters can become Quiet again when they interact with Cigarettes.\n   - The human character can only step back when encountering walls.\n\n3. **Level Layout**: The game features a grid-like layout where walls are immovable, and the player navigates through an area filled with citizens and potential hazards (i.e., George).\n\n**Objectives**:\n- The primary objective appears to involve managing interactions between different NPCs (citizens, George) while avoiding being caught by George and manipulating their states to earn a score or benefit.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- The player loses if the avatar is caught by George or if the number of Quiet characters reaches zero (along with the Avatar).\n- The player wins if they manage to survive within the time limit of 1000 units while potentially keeping a certain number of NPCs in their desired states.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Stay Mobile**: Keep the avatar moving to avoid being caught by George. Use the walls for cover and to create distance from the chaser.\n\n2. **Manipulate NPCs**: Balance the transitioning states of the citizens and the annoyed NPCs. Utilize interactions strategically to maintain a certain number of Quiet NPCs while minimizing the presence of Annoyed ones.\n\n3. **Time Management**: Be mindful of the 1000-time unit limit. Engage in actions that quickly help shift George to Annoyed (which could give a bit of breathing room) whilst consistently targeting objectives that maintain the number of sprites needed for victory.\n\n4. **Avoid Negative Score Points**: Direct engagements with George could lead to a score decrease. Assess when it's necessary to confront him versus when to evade and manipulate the environment and NPCs.\n\n5. **Use Cigarettes Wisely**: Ensure to collect and use Cigarettes strategically as they can assist in transforming Annoyed NPCs back into Quiet states, contributing positively towards your win condition.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players should be able to navigate through the game's mechanics successfully, manage interactions, and potentially achieve the winning conditions while avoiding loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->

I expect this aligns well with our strategy of staying mobile to avoid confrontation.",
