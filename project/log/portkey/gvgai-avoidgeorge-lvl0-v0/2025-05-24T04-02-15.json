Players navigate a map, interact with different characters and items, and must solve problems to achieve their objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - There are different types of entities (sprites) you can interact with such as:\n     - **Immovable objects**: Walls and the floor.\n     - **NPCs**: Including the annoyances and citizens.\n     - **Avatar**: Your character that the player controls.\n     - **Items**: In this case, a cigarette, which can stick to certain interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The game features a variety of interactions:\n     - The \"quiet\" NPC can be transformed into an \"annoyed\" state by another NPC (George).\n     - The avatar can interact with George to \"kill\" him (likely a way to eliminate obstacles).\n     - The annoyed sprite can be transformed into a \"quiet\" state by touching the cigarette, which gives a score bonus.\n     - The player is restricted by walls and can only step back when hitting them.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends if you run out of the \"sprites\" for the avatar or quiet NPCs, or if the set time limit of 1000 is reached.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is likely to manage interactions in such a way that you maximize the number of 'quiet' sprites or keep your avatar in play while navigating through the level before the time limit is up. Each interaction can either gain or lose points, effectively giving rise to strategic choices.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the count of the avatar or quiet sprites reaches zero.\n- **Win**: A win seems possible if the player reaches the timeout limit of 1000 without losing all their avatars or quiet sprites, suggesting a focus on survival and manipulation of NPC states.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Utilize Transformations**: Focus on using the \"cigarette\" effectively. Turning \"annoyed\" NPCs into \"quiet\" ones will be essential since quiet sprites contribute positively to your score.\n\n2. **Control George**: Since George can transition into the annoyed state, finding ways to use him to generate quiet sprites can be a key tactic. You may want to engineer situations where you can freely interact with him without losing your avatar.\n\n3. **Movement Optimization**: Be cautious around walls to minimize wasted moves. Step back when running into them to reposition yourself strategically, giving you more favorable options in approaching sprites.\n\n4. **Timing and Management**: Since there is a timeout limit, manage your actions wisely. Aim to balance between taking actions that improve your sprite counts while keeping track of the time.\n\n5. **Observation**: Keep an eye on the patterns of NPCs, especially their speed and transformation events, to plan out your moves efficiently throughout the level. This will allow you to set up beneficial interactions rather than reacting spontaneously.\n\nRemember, the goal is to adapt and make the most out of each interaction while being mindful of the winning conditions. Utilize your resources effectively to score points and keep your avatars alive as you work through the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngeorge ->
