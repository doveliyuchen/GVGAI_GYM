    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the **puzzle-platformer** genre. Players must navigate through the level, using their avatar to interact with various items while solving spatial puzzles and avoiding enemies.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent different elements within the game, including immovable objects (floor, wall, hole), active elements (moving objects, the avatar), and collectables (coins).\n- **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can move around the level freely, avoiding obstacles and engaging with other sprites.\n- **Interactions**: Interaction rules dictate how the avatar interacts with these sprites:\n  - The avatar can collect coins and activate switches.\n  - There are enemies (piranha) that can kill the avatar if contacted.\n  - Boxes can be used to manipulate the environment (e.g., bounce the avatar or block paths).\n  - The switch can spawn walls, affecting the layout of the level.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective appears to be:\n- Collect all the boxes in the level (to reach a limit of 0, which signifies win condition).\n- Avoid the piranha and strategize around movement to organically clear obstacles.\n- Collect coins for additional score points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game once the number of box sprites reaches zero.\n- **Lose Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar's count reaches zero (when it gets killed by piranhas or possibly other mechanisms) or if the time limit (1000 units) expires, which signifies failure.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid the Piranha**: Keep moving to dodge the piranha, using the walls and boxes as shields.\n2. **Box Management**: Use boxes to create pathways or barriers to control piranha movements. When a box falls into a hole, it adds to the score, so plan moves carefully.\n3. **Switch Utilization**: Strategically use the switches to modify the level's layout and create new paths or block piranhas' movements if necessary.\n4. **Collect Coins**: While moving through the level, gather coins for extra points, though focus primarily on fulfilling the primary objective of collecting boxes.\n5. **Time Management**: Monitor the timer to ensure you are making progress. If nearing the time limit, prioritize actions that will lead directly to obtaining boxes rather than exploring unnecessary areas.\n\nBy effectively navigating the complex level layout and utilizing interaction mechanics thoughtfully, players can work towards achieving the objective while maintaining safety from enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> .\nrow=2, col=22 -> .\nrow=2, col=23 -> .\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> w\nrow=3, col=18 -> w\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> w\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> .\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> .\nrow=4, col=22 -> .\nrow=4, col=23 -> .\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> 0\nrow=5, col=21 -> @\nrow=5, col=22 -> a\nrow=5, col=23 -> .\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar (a) is located at (5, 22). The possible actions include moving left (to (5, 21)), right (to (5, 23)), up (to (4, 22)), and down (to (6, 22)). \n\nSince I'm currently on a box (represented by '@'), my priority should be to either interact with the surrounding elements (potentially avoiding enemies) and continue collecting boxes. The wall (w) is obstructing movement to the left, up, and down.\n\n1. **Moving Left (to (5, 21))**: This position is on a floor with a '.' which does not directly lead to new interaction but is blocked by a wall above. \n2. **Moving Right (to (5, 23))**: This position is also a floor with '.' but leads further away from the box at (5, 21).\n3. **Moving Up (to (4, 22))**: This position is valid as it could provide an area to explore.\n4. **Moving Down (to (6, 22))**: This moves to the floor, but looks like it doesn't lead anywhere useful.\n\nSince I am aiming to collect the boxes and maximize movements that will lead to progress while avoiding proximity to enemies, I will move to the left. I expect that this will situate me closer to available further actions consisting of exploring upward, which appears to be free from nearby enemies and could lead to the box (1) to help achieve the game objective.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis move should align with my overall strategy of box collection while keeping safe from piranhas if they appear.",
