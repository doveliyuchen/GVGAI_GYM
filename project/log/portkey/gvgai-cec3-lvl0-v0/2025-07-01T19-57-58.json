Players likely navigate a character through a two-dimensional space while solving challenges.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include walls, floors, holes, and coins, which are static and serve different purposes within the game.\n   - **Moving Avatar:** Controlled by the player, represented as a knight, which can navigate through the level.\n   - **Piranha:** Acts as an enemy (chaser) that kills the avatar upon contact.\n   - **Boxes:** These can be moved by the avatar and can interact with the environment (they bounce off walls, and will be destroyed if they fall into holes).\n   - **Switches:** Trigger specific events when the avatar interacts with them (like spawning walls).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player controls the avatar to collect coins and boxes while avoiding the piranha.\n   - Boxes can be manipulated by the avatar and affect the environment when used in conjunction with holes or walls.\n   - The avatar can also act on switches, which may lead to new paths or changes in the level.\n\n#### Objectives\n- **Primary Objective:** The player must collect all the boxes to win the game, indicated by the condition that all boxes must be removed from the screen for a win.\n- **Secondary Objective:** Collecting coins may provide additional score points, although their collection does not affect the win state directly.\n  \n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** All boxes must be removed (count reaches zero).\n- **Loss Conditions:** \n   - The avatar dies (SpriteCounter hits zero).\n   - The player time limit is exceeded (timeout limit of 1000).\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Movements:** Before moving, look ahead to determine how to navigate boxes and avoid the piranha.\n   \n2. **Utilize the Boxes:** Use boxes to manipulate the environment; for example, pushing boxes towards holes to remove them from the level. Be cautious of their position to avoid getting them stuck.\n\n3. **Avoid Piranhas:** Keep a safe distance from the piranha. Understand its attack pattern, and make your movements planned and deliberate to minimize encounters.\n\n4. **Utilize Switches Wisely:** Activate switches carefully to manipulate walls for new pathways or temporarily block the piranha.\n\n5. **Timing and Patience:** Since there is a time limit, but you also want to avoid losing the avatar, take your time to think ahead and avoid hasty moves that lead to mistakes.\n\n6. **Coin Strategy:** While coins may not affect the win state, collecting them can be a fun extra goal\u2014try to collect them without compromising your main objectives.\n\nBy applying these strategies and closely monitoring the game's mechanics, players can effectively navigate the levels, solve puzzles, and achieve the objective of collecting all boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> .\nrow=2, col=22 -> .\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> w\nrow=3, col=18 -> w\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> w\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> .\nrow=4, col=22 -> .\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> a\nrow=5, col=21 -> @\nrow=5, col=22 -> 0\nrow=5, col=23 -> #\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your character (the knight represented as 'a') is located at (5, 20). There is a box ('@') at (5, 21) and a hole ('0') at (5, 22). Additionally, there are coins ('#') at (5, 23) and one immovable wall ('w') surrounds the area.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n- **Moving Left (ACTION_LEFT, 1):** This move would take the knight to (5, 19), which is a floor tile ('.') and thus a valid move.\n- **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT, 2):** This would take the knight to (5, 21), where the box (@) is located; this is also a valid move because boxes can be moved.\n- **Moving Down (ACTION_DOWN, 3):** This would take the knight to (6, 20), but all tiles in the row are walls, making this move invalid.\n- **Moving Up (ACTION_UP, 4):** This would take the knight to (4, 20), where there is a wall ('w'), making this move invalid.\n\n### Best Action:\nThe best action is to **move right**, as it allows the knight to push the box from (5, 21) to (5, 22), which is a hole that will remove the box from the level, thus progressing towards the primary objective of collecting all boxes.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis move is expected to successfully push the box into the hole and decrease the box count, aligning perfectly with the strategy of utilizing boxes effectively to manipulate the environment.",
