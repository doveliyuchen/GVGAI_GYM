Players control an avatar (likely a character or object) navigating through a level filled with obstacles, entities, and items to interact with.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites including:\n   - **Immovable**: Floor, walls, holes, and switches are fixed in place (cannot be moved).\n   - **Passive**: Boxes can be moved by the avatar but do not self-move.\n   - **Chaser**: The piranha actively pursues the avatar and can kill it.\n   - **Moving Object**: Indicated but not specified.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can be harmed by the piranha.\n   - Boxes can bounce the avatar forward when touched.\n   - Boxes that fall into holes lead to a loss of a sprite (possibly a life or score increment).\n   - Collecting coins adds to the score.\n   - Switches spawn walls that are dynamically placed in the level.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends unfavorably if the avatar reaches zero lives or if the timer runs out.\n   - The player wins when all boxes are cleared from the level.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to clear the level of all boxes while avoiding being killed by the piranha and managing any interactions with the environment, such as switches and holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by ensuring that there are no boxes remaining in the level.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses either by running out of avatars (lives) or by exceeding the time limit of 1000 units.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid the Piranha**: Since the piranha chases the avatar, maintain distance, and maneuver carefully to stay alive. Use walls and environments as barriers to block its path.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Move boxes strategically to possibly bounce onto platforms, clear paths, or position them to serve as barriers against the piranha. Ensure to keep an eye out for boxes that could fall into holes.\n\n3. **Collect Coins**: Whenever possible, collect coins for additional points. This might be beneficial for score-based objectives if they exist.\n\n4. **Engage Switches Mindfully**: Use switches sparingly and only when needed, as they spawn additional walls that could obstruct movement or create traps.\n\n5. **Plan Moves**: Before moving, assess the layout and plan out several moves ahead. This includes avoiding getting trapped or cornered by the piranha or moving walls.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Keep track of the timer, and make sure you are not wasting turns in areas without movement or progress toward eliminating boxes and collecting coins.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, players can efficiently navigate through the challenges posed by the level and work towards achieving a win condition while avoiding loss scenarios.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> .\nrow=2, col=22 -> .\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> w\nrow=3, col=18 -> w\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> w\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> .\nrow=4, col=22 -> .\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> a\nrow=5, col=21 -> @\nrow=5, col=22 -> 0\nrow=5, col=23 -> #\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",
