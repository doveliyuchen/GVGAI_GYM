Players navigate a 2D environment consisting of various sprites and utilize mechanics to overcome obstacles and achieve objectives.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites & Terrain**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: The game features objects like 'floor', 'hole', 'wall', and 'coin' that do not move, serving as environmental elements.\n   - **Passive Sprite**: The 'box' can interact with the player and other elements but does not move by itself.\n   - **Moving Characters**: The player controls an 'avatar' (knight), while a 'piranha' sprite chases the player.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins for points and must avoid or defeat the chasing piranha.\n   - Boxes can be used to bounce the avatar forward, which suggests puzzle solving may involve manipulating these boxes.\n   - When the avatar touches a switch, it spawns a wall behind it, indicating environmental changes that can affect navigation.\n   - The game includes killing conditions, both through player actions (e.g., touching boxes that fall into holes) and through sprite interactions (e.g., being caught by a piranha).\n\n### Objectives\n- **Primary Objective**: The main goal is to eliminate all 'box' sprites (limit = 0), which represent either obstacles or enemies in some contexts.\n- **Secondary Objectives**: Collect as many coins as possible while avoiding the piranha and navigating through the level.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the number of 'box' sprites reaches zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches a limit of 0) or if the timeout limit of 1000 units is reached without winning.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Navigate Carefully**: Use the layout to avoid the piranha while making your way towards the boxes. The piranha has a cooldown, giving the player a brief window to act without immediate threat.\n  \n2. **Box Utilization**: \n   - Use the boxes to move strategically; they can bounce the avatar and potentially knock them into advantageous positions in relation to holes or obstacles.\n   \n3. **Coin Collection**: Keep an eye out for coins while maintaining focus on the primary objective of removing boxes. Collecting coins boosts the score, which may be crucial depending on game objectives or levels.\n\n4. **Switch Management**: When encountering switches, be strategic about when to activate them. They create walls that could obstruct the piranha or allow for further navigation, but can also limit your paths if activated at the wrong moment.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Monitor the time-based limit (1000 units). Aim to achieve objectives efficiently. If progress stalls or challenges arise, focus on finding new paths or alternative routes to reach boxes.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can effectively engage with the game and navigate through its challenges while optimizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> .\nrow=2, col=22 -> .\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=13 -> w\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> w\nrow=3, col=18 -> w\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> w\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> .\nrow=4, col=22 -> .\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> a\nrow=5, col=21 -> @\nrow=5, col=22 -> 0\nrow=5, col=23 -> #\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",
