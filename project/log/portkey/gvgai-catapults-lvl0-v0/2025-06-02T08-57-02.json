    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here's a detailed analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy: \n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-oriented strategy game, likely with elements of exploration and navigation. The presence of sprites (game elements) like walls, water, and various types of avatars indicates it includes tactical decision-making with some action-based elements.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites such as walls, water, catapults, and avatars. Each sprite has specific properties (e.g., immovable, movable) and interactions with other sprites.\n2. **Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can change its orientation and avoid obstacles by moving in different directions (north, south, east, west). This suggests grid-based movement akin to classic puzzle games.\n3. **Interactions**: Different interactions define how sprites engage. For example:\n   - Bullets can destroy walls but result in a backward step for the moving wall.\n   - The catapult has the ability to kill the avatar, which indicates it may serve as a trap or a means of progressing through levels.\n   - The goal (a green door) can end the game and the avatar can navigate towards it.\n4. **Killing Mechanisms**: Interaction with sprites like water and catapults can result in the avatar's elimination, making navigational strategy essential.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate the avatar through the level towards the goal while managing interactions with other sprites (such as avoiding the catapult and navigating around walls). The avatar must reach the goal before all possible avatar instances are eliminated.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when there are no more goal sprites left, indicating all goals have been achieved.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (if it runs out of avatar sprites).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Mapping the Level**: Understand the layout of the level. Identify the location of walls, water bodies, catapults, and the goal. This assessment is crucial for planning movements.\n2. **Prioritize Movement**: Choose paths carefully to avoid lethal sprites, such as catapults and water. Utilize walls wisely to create a path forward.\n3. **Maximize Avatar Use**: Preserve avatar sprites by avoiding unnecessary confrontations with the catapult. Use the environment to stay safe and minimize risks.\n4. **Projection and Planning**: Consider the next few moves ahead. Since interactions like \"transform to\" indicate that movement direction significantly alters how interactions occur, always think about subsequent states when making a move.\n5. **Timing and Precision**: If there are active projectiles (bullets) in the game, time your movements to coincide with their trajectory to avoid collisions.\n\nThis strategic outline will help a player navigate and succeed in this puzzle-oriented game, balancing exploration, precise movement, and strategic interactions with the sprites.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, we need to determine the best action for the avatar based on the layout and rules provided. \n\n### Current Analysis:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar positions are represented by '@' and are located at (3, 1), (3, 3), (12, 5), (14, 7), (14, 8), and (14, 9). The goal (represented by '#') is located at (14, 15).\n2. **Obstacles and Features**: \n   - There are walls ('&') blocking various paths.\n   - Water ('*') is present in several areas which could be harmful if the avatar interacts with it.\n   - Moving floors ('$') at (1, 3) and other positions could present another layer of complexity in movement.\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n- The immediate goal is to navigate successfully towards the goal at (14, 15) while avoiding potential hazards.\n- There are moving pieces directly adjacent to the avatar and more complex systems further down, such as multiple avatars existing in different rows that can interact with the environment.\n\n### Plan of Action:\nTo strategize effectively:\n- Identify the safest path by keeping the avatar away from walls and water.\n- Utilize the multiple avatars wisely as a safety net since they can help navigate hazards.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nThe avatar at (12,5) is somewhat safe when considering movement opportunities. However, since there may need to be directional movement towards the goal (14, 15), the avatar should either move towards the right/right orientation if it is not blocked by any other sprite.\n\n**Recommended Action**:  \nGiven that the current state seems to suggest movement towards the right is optimal (specifically for avatars at (12,5) moving closer to the goal), I will perform the RIGHT action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to keep the avatar on a safe path while moving closer toward the goal, aligning with the overall strategy of cautious navigation.",
