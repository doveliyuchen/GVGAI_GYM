Players control an avatar navigating a grid-based layout while interacting with various sprites and obstacles.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include 'floor', 'water', 'catapult', 'walls', and 'goal'. They serve as obstacles or boundaries in the game.\n   - **Moving Sprites**: The 'avatar', 'moving', and 'bullet' sprites suggest there are dynamic elements that the player has to engage with.\n   - **Orientation Sprites**: There are specific directional indicators (north, south, east, west) that may aid the player in navigation.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The 'avatar' can transform based on interactions with the directional sprites (e.g., turning to face north, south, east, or west).\n   - When the avatar interacts with the 'catapult', it gains the ability to 'gaze' or focus, potentially aiming projectiles at enemies or obstacles.\n   - The game includes strategic interactions, like bullets that can knock over walls or make them retreat.\n\n3. **Goal and Scoring**:\n   - The primary objective is for the avatar to reach the 'goal', which is marked by a green door.\n   - Players can score points by navigating through the map, avoiding or eliminating obstacles using the 'catapult'. \n   - The player loses if the avatar is killed and must manage interactions to prevent this.\n\n#### Objective\nTo win, the player must:\n- Navigate the avatar through the level, avoiding hazards (like water), and reach the goal without losing all avatar sprites.\n- Remove or evade the 'catapult' sprites as part of their progression, as these can kill their avatar.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when all 'goal' sprites are collected or nullified, indicated by the SpriteCounter for 'goal' being 0.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when all 'avatar' sprites are eliminated (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' reaching 0).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls, floors, and goal locations \u2014 the arrangement greatly influences movement and strategic planning.\n\n2. **Utilize Visual Cues**: Pay attention to your avatar\u2019s directional facing. Use this to manage how you interact with the sprites, particularly in relation to the 'catapult' which can be crucial to your score and survival.\n\n3. **Manage Projectiles Wisely**: Use bullets effectively to interact with walls and eliminate them strategically. This can clear paths and create new routes towards the goal.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of water areas as they cause instant loss of your avatar. Ensure you're assessing routes and alternatives to prevent falling victim to environmental hazards.\n\n5. **Plan Movements**: Since you can change direction based on certain sprites, plan your moves considering the sprite configuration and how that affects your route to the goal.\n\n6. **Score Maximization**: Engage with catapults only when necessary. They can improve your score but also pose a threat if overused. \n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate challenges effectively towards achieving victory in the puzzle-platformer, maintaining a careful balance between scoring and survival.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
