It involves navigating an avatar through a maze-like environment with specific rules governing interactions and movement. The presence of different sprites and their interactions suggests a gameplay focused on spatial reasoning and tactical decisions.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites are used, including walls, water, a catapult, and a goal, each having specific functions (e.g., walls block movement, water is lethal, and the catapult attracts the avatar).\n2. **Movement and Orientation**: The avatar can orient itself in four directions (north, south, east, west) and interacts with the environment differently based on its orientation.\n3. **Interactions**: Key interactions include:\n   - Moving toward a catapult can lead to the avatar being \"killed\" for a score change, suggesting that netting a higher score is a game objective.\n   - The avatar can face different directions to transform its type, which seems crucial for navigating the maze.\n   - Water is a lethal hazard, which discourages movement into those spaces.\n4. **Goals**: The ultimate goal is to reach the green \"goal\" sprite, while trying to manage the avatar count, suggesting a resource management element.\n\n#### Objective\n1. Reach the goal sprite (green) while ensuring the avatar count is not zero.\n2. Potentially score points by interacting with catapults and possibly other sprite types.\n3. Solve the layout puzzle, navigating efficiently to avoid hazards and maximize movement.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no avatars left on the field (SpriteCounter for the avatar type reaches 0) and the goal is reached.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the number of avatars reaches zero before reaching the goal.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Careful Movement**: Survey the environment carefully before moving. Avoid paths that lead to water sections or increase avatar decrement.\n2. **Utilize Catapults Wisely**: Consider using catapults as necessary to score points while maintaining a healthy avatar count.\n3. **Plan Orientation Shifts**: Change the avatar's orientation strategically to navigate walls and obstacles efficiently. Knowing where you want to go next is critical for minimizing backtracking.\n4. **Prioritize the Goal**: Focus on navigating to the goal first, as completing this objective is integral to winning. Avoid unnecessary engagements that don't lead to progression toward the goal.\n5. **Map Awareness**: Develop an understanding of the level layout, identifying safe pathways and potential traps, which may require thoughtful planning before proceeding.\n\nThrough the balanced execution of these strategies based on the game's mechanics, players can effectively work toward achieving the game's objectives while mitigating risks from environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "The current game configuration indicates that the avatar is situated on a space that is vibrant with various sprites. Notably, there are walls ('&') around the borders of the grid, water ('*') poses as a hazard, catapults ('@') might draw the avatar towards them, and the goal ('#') is located at (14, 15).\n\nGiven the sprite layout around the avatar's position, I need to establish a useful action that can move towards the goal while ensuring the risk of encountering hazards, such as water, is minimal.\n\nSince no specific avatar position was provided in relation to the instructions, I will assume it's essential to execute a movement action that reinforces exploration without directly moving into water or away from the goal.\n\nThus, as a priority, I will check the immediate possible movements. Moving right from any current position would potentially advance towards the goal, provided that the next cell isn't occupied by water.\n\nTherefore, I will choose:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is aimed at moving right and assessing paths further while aligning with the overall strategy of approaching the goal.",
