Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Feel:\n\u2003\u2013 A puzzle/strategy game where you move an avatar around a maze\u2010like level.\n\u2003\u2013 It involves spatial reasoning and careful planning as you maneuver objects (boxes) to achieve the objective.\n\n\u2022 Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 You control an avatar that can move around, but when it runs into walls it bounces back.\n\u2003\u2013 Boxes (shown with one sprite image) can be pushed around by the avatar.\n\u2003\u2013 When a box contacts a \u201chole\u201d tile (an immovable dark blue tile), it transforms into another version of itself (called \u201cboxin\u201d) and you gain a point.\n\u2003\u2013 However, if that transformed box (\u201cboxin\u201d) then touches \u201cground\u201d (a different immovable tile, marked by floor images), it reverts back into the original box while subtracting a point.\n\u2003\u2013 There is also a \u201cbbox\u201d sprite that interacts with the avatar and walls in ways that cause the avatar to bounce or even undo moves in certain chain reactions, although these are more like background or helper interactions.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your goal is to remove all the regular boxes from the level. The win condition is met when the sprite count for the box (stype=box) reaches zero.\n\u2003\u2013 In practice, you must \u201csink\u201d these boxes by pushing them into holes so that they are transformed into the boxin state (which aren\u2019t counted as boxes for the win condition).\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s crucial that once a box is sunk (turned into boxin), it stays over the hole rather than being moved onto a ground tile, which would undo your progress by reverting it back to a box.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Identify the boxes and the holes in the level. The layout gives you hints \u2013 walls form the boundaries, holes are represented (perhaps as \u201co\u201d in the layout), and boxes are likely the \u201c*\u201d symbols.\n\u20032. Plan your moves so that you push the box directly into a hole. Be careful with your pushes; once a box reaches a hole and transforms (to boxin), don\u2019t accidentally nudge it off onto a ground tile.\n\u20033. Work slowly and methodically: determine which box can go to which hole without blocking future moves.\n\u20034. Since walls block movement and sometimes cause your avatar to bounce back or even trigger undo actions (as seen in the interactions with bbox), think ahead about how you\u2019ll position yourself and the boxes.\n\u20035. Remember, if you mistakenly push a boxin onto a ground tile, it turns back into a box, potentially setting you back. Accuracy and planning are key.\n\nIn simple terms, the game challenges you to solve spatial puzzles by strategically moving boxes so that they \u201cdisappear\u201d (all become boxin resting in holes). Manage your moves carefully to avoid accidentally undoing your progress and ultimately clear all the boxes to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> %\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> a\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $",
