This is the key \u201cconversion\u201d move.  \n\u2003\u2013 However, if that transformed box (boxin) later touches the ground, it reverts back to a regular box with a score penalty.  \n\u2003\u2013 There are additional collision reactions (for example, the avatar bounces back when colliding with walls, and certain interactions between boxes and walls can trigger an undo of moves).\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win Condition:  \n\u2003\u2013 The goal is to eliminate all regular boxes on the board.  \n\u2003\u2013 The game checks that the number of boxes (stype=box) is zero to declare a win.  \n\u2003\u2013 This essentially means you want to convert every box into a boxin and keep them there, ensuring they don\u2019t accidentally revert to the standard box state by touching the ground.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:  \n\u20031. Plan Your Moves:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Study the level layout to identify where the holes are relative to the boxes and your avatar.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Think ahead to avoid dead-end moves or situations where a box might become stuck against walls.  \n\n\u20032. Convert Boxes Carefully:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The primary mechanic is to push a box onto a hole so it turns into a boxin (and counts toward your progress).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Make sure that once a box has been converted, it stays in a safe spot where it won\u2019t accidentally slide onto a ground tile, which would reverse the conversion.  \n\n\u20033. Manage Movement Reactions:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Understand that collisions (for example, with walls) cause your avatar to step back, and collisions involving boxes can trigger \u201cbounce\u201d or even complete undo of moves if a box hits a wall in a certain way.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use these reactions to your advantage by planning pushes so you can control the boxes\u2019 positions precisely.  \n\n\u20034. Avoid Undo Mishaps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Be cautious of any sequence that might cause the undoAll trigger (for instance, a box colliding with a wall in a problematic way), as this could set you back substantially.  \n\n\u2022 In Short:  \n\u2003\u2013 Navigate the level with careful movements, pushing boxes toward the holes where they convert and \u201cdisappear\u201d from the box counter.  \n\u2003\u2013 Hurry to lock in the positive transformation by ensuring transformed boxes don\u2019t accidentally hit ground tiles and revert.  \n\u2003\u2013 Solve the puzzle by converting all boxes (reducing the box counter to zero) while managing the unique physics and collision rules.\n\nThis overall approach\u2014meticulous planning, precise pushes, and careful control of the transformation mechanics\u2014is the key to mastering this puzzle game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> a\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> %\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> %\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $",
