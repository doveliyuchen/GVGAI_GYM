Game Type and Genre:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a grid\u2010based puzzle game with elements of block pushing similar in spirit to classic \u201cSokoban\u201d puzzles.\n\u2003\u2022 The focus is on moving objects around the level while managing transformation rules, meaning every move can change the state of certain objects.\n\n2. Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 You control an avatar that moves on a grid.\n\u2003\u2022 The level is set up with walls (impassable), floors, and special tiles like \u201chole\u201d and \u201cground.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 There are two key box types: \u201cbox\u201d and \u201cboxin.\u201d A \u201cbox\u201d pushed onto a \u201chole\u201d transforms into \u201cboxin\u201d (and you gain a little score). But if a \u201cboxin\u201d then goes onto \u201cground,\u201d it turns back into a \u201cbox\u201d (and you lose a bit of score).\n\u2003\u2022 Other interactions include bouncing (for example, when a moving passive item labeled \u201cbbox\u201d hits the avatar) and an odd undo mechanic when these \u201cbbox\u201d objects collide with walls in a certain way.\n\u2003\u2022 Collisions with walls make your avatar step back, so you have to plan your moves carefully.\n\n3. Objective:\n\u2003\u2022 The win condition is met by eliminating all \u201cbox\u201d sprites from the level \u2013 the game ends (and you win) when the sprite counter for boxes reaches zero.\n\u2003\u2022 In other words, you want to remove boxes from play by using the transformation interaction (by pushing them into holes).\n\n4. Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 Win: You clear all the boxes.\n\u2003\u2022 Loss isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned here, but making the wrong moves (such as accidentally turning a \u201cboxin\u201d back into a \u201cbox\u201d or triggering unwanted undo moves) could force you into an unsolvable position.\n\n5. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Carefully plan your moves. Since boxes can change state depending on where they are (hole versus ground), you must precisely control where you push them.\n\u2003\u2022 The basic goal is to push each box onto a hole so it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d (gaining a little score) and eventually clear them from the board. However, be cautious: if a \u201cboxin\u201d moves onto a ground tile unexpectedly, it reverts back to a \u201cbox\u201d (and you lose some progress/score).\n\u2003\u2022 Work from the outer edges of the level inward (or vice versa) in a thoughtful sequence so that you don\u2019t block yourself or accidentally trigger the undo mechanic with bounce effects.\n\u2003\u2022 Utilize the environment \u2013 use walls and the layout to help reposition boxes without unwanted bounces.\n\u2003\u2022 Think a few moves ahead: every push might have a ripple effect (especially with interactions like the \u201cbbox wall bbox\u201d undo action), so planning and spatial awareness are key.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re solving a spatial puzzle where your timing and move order determine whether you ultimately clear all the boxes by carefully directing them into holes. Good planning and anticipation of chain reactions in tile behavior will win the day!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> %\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $",
