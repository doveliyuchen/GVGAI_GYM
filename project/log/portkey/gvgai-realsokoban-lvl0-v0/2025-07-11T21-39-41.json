    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game:\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle game, likely a Sokoban variant (box-pushing puzzle).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The 'avatar' can move.\n*   **Pushing:**  The 'avatar' probably pushes 'box' sprites.\n*   **Immovable Obstacles:** 'wall', 'floor', 'ground', and 'hole' sprites cannot be moved.\n*   **Special Interaction 'bbox':** The role of 'bbox' is to set the condition for \"bounceForward\" when interacting with the avatar. Additionally, 'bbox' sprites are removed when it interacts with a 'wall', and another 'bbox' sprite.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The player must get all of the 'box' sprites into 'hole' sprites.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The player wins when the number of 'box' sprites remaining in the level is zero. (All boxes are in holes)\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   Implicit:  The player likely loses if they get a 'box' stuck in a corner or against a wall in a way that it can no longer be moved into a 'hole'. There's no explicit loss condition defined, so unsolvable states are handled implicitly.\n\n**Sprites Role:**\n\n*   **'floor'/'ground':** Likely the walkable areas of the level. The difference between them is only relevant when interacting with the 'boxin' sprite.\n*   **'hole':** The target locations for the 'box' sprites.\n*   **'avatar':** The player-controlled character.\n*   **'box':** The crates that must be pushed into the 'hole' sprites.\n*   **'boxin':** The state of a 'box' sprite when it is in a 'hole'.\n*   **'wall':** The boundaries of the level and obstacles.\n*   **'bbox':** Passive boundaries that interacts with the player avatar, and the 'wall' to undo all moves when 'bbox' get stuck between 'wall' and other 'bbox' sprite.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban games require careful planning.  Think several moves ahead to avoid getting boxes stuck.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:**  Once a 'box' is in a corner, it's usually impossible to get it out.\n3.  **Use Walls to Your Advantage:** Walls can be used to control the movement of the boxes.\n4.  **Prioritize Boxes:** Some 'box' sprites might be easier to move into their respective 'hole' sprites than others. Tackle the easier ones first.\n5.  **Undo System:** Since the game has 'bbox' sprite mechanic to bounce the avatar and undo all moves when getting stuck, use it wisely.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> a\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $",
