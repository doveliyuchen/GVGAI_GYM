    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here is an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game fits the **puzzle** genre, likely resembling a variant of classic games like **Sokoban** or block-pushing puzzles. Players manipulate game elements (boxes) to achieve certain goals within a constrained environment.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game contains various sprites such as walls, floors, holes, an avatar (the player's character), and boxes. These elements interact uniquely with one another.\n2. **Movable Elements**: The 'avatar' can be moved by the player, while 'boxes' can be pushed toward certain objectives (like holes).\n3. **Immovable Elements**: Walls and certain types of boxes act as barriers and cannot be moved, affecting how players navigate the level.\n4. **Interactions**:\n   - The **avatar** can\u2019t go through walls and will step back if it collides with one.\n   - Pushing a box into a hole transforms it into a different sprite (boxin) and grants points (scoreChange=1).\n   - A box that is \"in\" the hole can be pushed onto the ground, reverting it back and deducting points (scoreChange=-1).\n\n### Objective\nThe main goal is to eliminate all normal boxes ('box') in the level, indicated by having a limit of zero on the 'box' sprite counter (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True). Players need to strategically push boxes into holes to achieve this objective.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the counter of 'box' sprites reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: While there are no explicit loss conditions mentioned, strategic missteps could create scenarios from which a player can't win (like being unable to push boxes correctly without reverting necessary transformations).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Ahead**: Analyze the board layout before making moves. Ensure to visualize how moving one box affects others.\n2. **Prioritize Moves**: Focus on pushing boxes into holes first, as this is the main way to lower the count of boxes.\n3. **Avoid Unnecessary Reversion**: Avoid pushing boxes from holes onto the ground unless necessary, since this results in a score deduction and could hinder progress.\n4. **Navigate Wisely**: Utilize walls effectively to control the movement of your avatar and boxes, ensuring you always have valid moves available.\n5. **Trial and Error**: If stuck, consider retracing steps to reset positions, understanding that box placement is key.\n\nApplying these strategies should help successfully navigate the puzzles and achieve the game\u2019s objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> @\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> @\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar ('a') is currently at (row 2, col 2).\n2. **Boxes**: There are three boxes ('@') positioned at (row 1, col 2), (row 1, col 6), and (row 5, col 6).\n3. **Holes**: There are two holes ('#') located at (row 2, col 3) and (row 4, col 5).\n4. **Walls**: There are walls ('$') surrounding the entire play area that restrict movement.\n\n### Strategy Analysis\nFrom the current position:\n- The avatar can move either up to (row 1, col 2) where a box is located or down to (row 3, col 2) where there are open spaces.\n- The closest hole to the avatar is at (row 2, col 3).\n\n### Planned Action\nTo progress towards winning by eliminating boxes, I should move towards the box at (row 1, col 2) in order to push it towards the hole at (row 2, col 3).\n\n### Action Decision\nMoving **UP** should allow me to contact the box.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should not only enable me to position next to the box but also prepares to push it into the hole in subsequent moves, aligning with our overall strategy to eliminate the boxes as quickly as possible.",
