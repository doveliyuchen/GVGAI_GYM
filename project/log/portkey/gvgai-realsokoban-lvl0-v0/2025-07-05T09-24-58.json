    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules, the game can be categorized as a **puzzle platformer**. In this genre, players typically navigate a character through a level while solving puzzles, often involving elements like obstacles, moving objects, and strategic placement.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**:\n   - The player controls an 'avatar' sprite (the knight) that moves around the level.\n   - There are immovable sprites ('wall', 'floor', 'ground', 'hole') that restrict movement.\n   - The 'box' sprites can be manipulated by the avatar.\n   \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce back when colliding with walls.\n   - When the avatar collides with the 'bbox', it pushes the box forward.\n   - Boxes can be placed in holes to transform them into 'boxin' sprites, which changes their score value.\n\n3. **Transformations**:\n   - Boxes placed in holes increase the score and are represented as 'boxin'.\n   - Conversely, 'boxin' boxes placed on the ground revert to 'box' and reduce the score.\n\n4. **Score and Termination**:\n   - The game has a scoring system based on the transformation of boxes.\n   - The game ends in victory when there are no more 'box' sprites left (i.e., all have been transformed to 'boxin').\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to manipulate the boxes within the constraints of the level to transform all 'box' sprites into 'boxin' sprites. This involves strategically placing boxes in the holes while avoiding actions that revert them back to their original state.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully transform all 'box' sprites into 'boxin' sprites, achieving the sprite counter limit of zero (0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game does not state explicit loss conditions, but failure to manage the movement and interactions could result in being unable to achieve the win condition.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Ahead**: Before executing moves, visualize how each action will affect the position of boxes and the overall layout. Given that walls can bounce you back, consider movement paths carefully.\n\n2. **Prioritize Box Placement**: Focus on getting as many boxes as possible into the holes before they can be reverted back to 'box'. Keep track of the number of boxes left and what states they are in.\n\n3. **Avoid Reversion**: When moving boxes, avoid placing them in configurations that would cause them to revert to 'box' if possible. If needed, keep one \u2018box\u2019 ready to ensure you have flexibility for movements.\n\n4. **Use Bounce to Your Advantage**: Understand how bouncing off walls can be used strategically to position the avatar correctly without colliding into problematic setups.\n\n5. **Experimentation**: If stuck, don\u2019t hesitate to try different approaches. The interactions might lead to unexpected results, allowing you to find new routes or solutions.\n\nBy following these strategies while being mindful of the interactions between sprites, players can methodically solve the puzzles and achieve victory in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> a\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> @\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $",

    "content": "To assess the current state of the game, let's identify the relevant entities surrounding our avatar, represented by 'a'.\n\n### Current Position Analysis\n- The avatar is located at (1, 3).\n- To the left (1, 2), there's a box ('@').\n- To the right (1, 4), there's another box ('@').\n- Up (0, 3), down (2, 3), and the other positions in the same row contain walls or other blockage.\n\n### Strategy Review\nOur primary goal is to manipulate the boxes to place them in holes to convert them into 'boxin' sprites, ultimately removing all 'box' sprites from the map. Currently, I have two boxes adjacent to my avatar. The first step would be to either move left or right to engage a box and prepare it for placement. \n\nSince both boxes are available next to the avatar, I will opt to move to the right (to (1, 4)), directly engaging the second box, as it is within reach and there\u2019s a hole directly below it that can be targeted next.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to engage the box is a calculated step towards aligning it with the hole below for future placement. By acting on this direction, I am optimizing the next steps according to the strategy of prioritizing box placements while ensuring the avatar's position changes successfully.",
