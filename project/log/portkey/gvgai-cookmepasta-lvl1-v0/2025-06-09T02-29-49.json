Players must gather ingredients, combine them correctly, and prepare a dish while navigating through a series of obstacles and interactions.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n   - **Floor (Immovable)**: Represents the ground the player walks on.\n   - **Avatar (MovingChef)**: The main character that the player controls.\n   - **Ingredients**: Various items (pasta, tomatoes, tuna) that can be combined.\n   - **Boiling Water**: A transformation point for cooking the raw pasta.\n   - **Key and Lock**: The key allows the player to unlock certain areas or actions.\n   - **Placed Ingredients**: Represents components assembled correctly for the final dish.\n   - **Wrong Place Indicators**: Feedback for incorrect combinations.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Players combine ingredients to create final dishes or components.\n   - Only specific combinations yield positive results (e.g., combining raw pasta with boiling water successfully).\n   - Incorrect combinations lead to penalties (loss of score).\n   - Collecting the key is necessary for progress since it interacts with the lock.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to correctly prepare a dish by:\n- Collecting necessary ingredients (like raw pasta, tuna, and tomatoes).\n- Using boiling water to cook the pasta.\n- Combining them in the correct order to create a 'plateinplace' (final dish) while avoiding wrong combinations.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The game ends in a win when the player has created at least one 'plateinplace'.\n- The game is lost if the player makes one incorrect combination (results in 'wrongplace').\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore and Gather**:\n   - Start by exploring the space to locate all necessary ingredients (raw pasta, tomatoes, tuna).\n   - Collect the key as soon as possible to unlock areas for resource gathering.\n\n2. **Focus on Combinations**:\n   - Prioritize cooking the raw pasta using boiling water.\n   - After cooking the pasta, carefully manage your combinations to avoid 'wrongplace' interactions. \n\n3. **Correct Sequence**:\n   - Combine ingredients in a specific, known sequence to maximize score and avoid getting a 'wrongplace':\n     1. Use boiling water on raw pasta.\n     2. Combine the cooked pasta with sauce (created from tomatoes and tuna).\n     3. Ensure the 'sauceinplace' and 'pastainplace' are created before making the final plate.\n\n4. **Resource Management**:\n   - Keep track of your key resource limits and ensure not to waste resources. \n   - Use the key only when it's necessary to progress.\n\n5. **Avoid Pitfalls**:\n   - Be cautious when experimenting with combinations, as one mistake can lead to failure.\n   - Plan your moves ahead of time, particularly near walls and locks to avoid unnecessary steps back.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the rules and interactions, players can effectively work toward winning the game while enjoying the cooking-themed puzzle mechanics.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> &\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> @\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> a\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "The current state of the game shows that my avatar (represented by 'a') is at position (row 7, col 1). The nearest important items around me are:\n\n- **Boiling Water**: Located at (row 6, col 1), just above my current position.\n- **Tomato**: Located at (row 1, col 5), and it is farther away.\n- **Raw Pasta**: Located at (row 6, col 12), and it is also fairly distant.\n\nAccording to the overall strategy, I need to explore and gather ingredients effectively, while focusing on using the boiling water on the raw pasta. Since my avatar is positioned in the floor area at (row 7, col 1), my immediate task is to move toward the boiling water in the direction above me.\n\nI will take an UP action to try and reach the boiling water:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up toward the boiling water will bring me closer to preparing a dish in line with the game's mechanics and objectives, thus aligning with the strategy.",
