Players must carefully manipulate various game objects to achieve the desired end goal, similar to typical cooking or simulation games.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game contains several types of sprites including:\n   - **Player Character (avatar)**: A moving chef that interacts with ingredients and objects.\n   - **Immovable Objects**: Floors, walls, and locks that create boundaries and obstacles.\n   - **Resources**: Ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna) and cooking elements (boiling water) needed for the game progression.\n   - **Lock and Key System**: Players need a key to access further areas or unlock recipes.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game features various interactions between the avatar and different sprites:\n   - Collecting ingredients and combining them to create dishes.\n   - Placing items correctly in order to score points.\n   - Wrong combinations result in negative points or penalties.\n\n3. **Scoring**: The game implements a scoring system that rewards correct combinations and punishes incorrect ones.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to create a dish (represented by the `plateinplace` sprite) by correctly combining ingredients and using resources. Players need to avoid making incorrect combinations that lead to the `wrongplace` sprite, which decreases their score.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Successfully create a dish, represented by the `plateinplace` sprite (limit of 1 for a win).\n- **Loss Condition**: Accumulate a `wrongplace` sprite (limit of 1 for a loss) due to incorrect ingredient combinations.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Ingredient Combinations**: Familiarize yourself with which ingredients can be combined without resulting in `wrongplace`. For instance, combining raw pasta with boiling water is necessary to create `pastainplace`.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Collect the key early on since it will be critical for unlocking areas and possibly accessing more ingredients or achieving points.\n\n3. **Plan Combinations Efficiently**: Always think ahead about the possible outcomes of combining two ingredients. For example, combining tomato and tuna will yield a positive outcome, while pairing raw pasta with most other ingredients will lead to penalties.\n\n4. **Use the Environment Wisely**: The interaction with walls and locked areas can prevent progress. Make sure to navigate carefully and use the environment to your advantage.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Aim for maximizing score output by achieving combinations that lead directly to `plateinplace`. Focus on creating and holding onto combinations that score highly while avoiding potential missteps.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Sometimes, experimentation can unlock the best strategies. If a combination leads to `wrongplace`, learn from that to refine future attempts.\n\nOverall, the game encourages strategic thinking, careful planning, and a bit of experimentation to adjust to the interactions and conditions present in the game world.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The avatar is right next to boiling water, which is beneficial because it\u2019s an essential ingredient for making pasta.\n2. The action should be to interact with the boiling water by moving to its position since I want to create a dish with raw pasta, and I don't have any immediate negative combinations that would lead to a loss (like encountering `wrongplace`).\n\nThus, I will move towards the boiling water.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is aimed at moving the avatar to the boiling water, which should help in progressing towards creating a dish.",
