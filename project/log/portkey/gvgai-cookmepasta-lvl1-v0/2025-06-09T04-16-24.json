The primary focus is on combining various ingredients and resources to create a final dish while navigating through obstacles.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Different sprites represent various elements such as the player's avatar (chef), ingredients (raw pasta, tomatoes, tuna), tools (boiling water), and objects (lock and key).\n- **Interactions:** The game includes specific interactions between the sprites, determining how they combine, transform or react. For example, the raw pasta must be combined with boiling water to become pasta on a plate.\n- **Movement:** The avatar can move around the game environment, interacting with resources and obstacles.\n- **Score System:** Scores can be adjusted based on successful or incorrect combinations (e.g., gaining points for correct combinations and losing points for wrong combinations). \n\n**Objectives:**\n- The main objective is to successfully combine ingredients to create a \"plateinplace\" sprite, which represents the final dish.\n- Players must do this while managing interactions carefully to ensure they don\u2019t exceed a limit that leads to wrong combinations.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully create the \"plateinplace\" by combining the right ingredients (pasta + sauce).\n- **Loss Condition:** If a single instance of the \"wrongplace\" sprite is created, the player loses.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Prioritize collecting the key to unlock the lock, as accessing other areas might help find combinations that lead to success.\n  \n2. **Careful Ingredient Handling:**\n   - Focus on the correct combinations to transform raw pasta into \"pastainplace\" using boiling water and then combine that with the appropriate sauce to achieve \"plateinplace.\"\n   - Avoid mixing raw pasta with ingredients that lead to \"wrongplace\" initially to preserve your score and avoid losing.\n\n3. **Utilize Boiling Water Wisely:**\n   - Ensure that raw pasta is used with boiling water as soon as possible to maximize scoring efficiency.\n\n4. **Ingredient Order:**\n   - After obtaining the pasta, prioritize getting the sauce (tomato + tuna) next to ensure you can complete the dish promptly.\n  \n5. **Watch Out for Obstacles:**\n   - Be aware of the walls and locks while moving around. Ensure you have the right resources before attempting to unlock or move through those areas.\n\n6. **Keep a Close Eye on the Score:** \n   - Try to minimize the number of transformations that lead to \"wrongplace\" as these will directly detract from your score and lead to potential failure conditions.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can maximize your effectiveness in combining elements and achieving the primary objective, leading to a successful and enjoyable game experience.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

There is boiling water at (9, 1), which I can utilize to cook ingredients.\n\nFollowing the suggested strategy, my priority should be to gather the raw pasta to begin producing the final dish (which involves transforming it first into pasta). The closest raw pasta is located at (8, 10), and I need to move towards that location.\n\nFirst, I will attempt to move left to check if I can reach the raw pasta effectively and push towards securing important ingredients while avoiding creating any incorrect combinations. \n\nThe action I will take is: \n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action should move my avatar to the left, possibly allowing access to the raw pasta in the next turn while maintaining a focus on preparing the necessary dish. My expectation is to effectively adjust my position in a way that I can manipulate the ingredients to create the desired combinations next.",
