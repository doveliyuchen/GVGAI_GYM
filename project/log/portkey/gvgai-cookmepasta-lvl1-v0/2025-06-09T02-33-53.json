    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, I can analyze and summarize the game as follows:\n\n### Game Overview:\n**Genre:** \nThis game appears to fall into the puzzle genre with elements of resource management and crafting. The interaction between various ingredients and the avatar suggests a focus on problem-solving through combining items.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - Different sprites represent various elements, such as the avatar (a chef), ingredients (raw pasta, tomatoes, tuna), and objects (locks, walls).\n   - There are movable and immovable elements, with some sprites having specific functions (passive, resource gathering).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can collect a key and interact with ingredients to create dishes.\n   - Combining the right ingredients yields positive outcomes (scores) or the wrong ones leads to negative scoring consequences.\n   - The cooking process requires specific combinations with proper sequencing; for example, combining raw pasta with boiling water results in cooked pasta.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends with a win if a completed dish (plateinplace) is created.\n   - Conversely, if the player makes a single wrong combination (wrongplace), it results in a loss.\n\n### Objectives:\n- **Primary Objective:** Create a final dish represented by the 'plateinplace' sprite by combining ingredients correctly.\n- **Secondary Objectives:** Collect resources (like a key) to unlock certain areas and progress in the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning Condition:** Successfully combine ingredients to achieve 'plateinplace.'\n- **Losing Condition:** Create 'wrongplace' even once, which leads to an immediate loss.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Ingredient Collection:** Start by collecting all ingredients available in the level before making any combinations. This helps plan the optimal sequence of cooking.\n\n2. **Prioritize Components:** Focus on boiling raw pasta first. Only after securing cooked pasta should you attempt to combine it with other ingredients.\n\n3. **Correct Combinations:**\n   - Use boiling water with raw pasta before moving onto sauces.\n   - Combine tomatoes and tuna effectively to create 'sauceinplace,' then combine it with 'pastainplace' to make 'plateinplace.'\n\n4. **Avoid Wrong Combinations:**\n   - Be cautious about combining raw ingredients that have known penalties (e.g., raw pasta with tomato directly can result in a loss).\n   - Stay aware of the interactions to minimize mistakes that can cause the game to end prematurely.\n\n5. **Utilize the Key:** If your level has a lock, always prioritize collecting the key to gain access to new areas or additional resources.\n\n6. **Plan Your Movements:** The level layout suggests walls that could limit movement. Always have a clear route planned to avoid unnecessary backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis game encourages strategic thinking, careful planning, and the management of resources under specific conditions. Mastering the combinations of ingredients and understanding their interactions is crucial to success. Use the strategy above to navigate the challenges effectively and create the desired dishes!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

Since there is boiling water directly to the left at (9, 1), the best action is to move left.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move will enable you to collect the boiling water while considering the necessary sequence for dish preparation.
