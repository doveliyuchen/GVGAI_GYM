    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**:  \nThis game is a puzzle-based cooking simulation with platforming elements. Players manipulate ingredients in a kitchen-like environment to create a dish successfully.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: Various sprites represent the player (avatar), ingredients, and obstacles (walls, keys, and locks). The 'avatar' moves around in the environment, while 'ingredients' function as passive items that can be combined.\n- **Interactions**: Players can combine different ingredients and objects to achieve outcomes, both positive (creating dishes) and negative (wrong combinations causing penalties).\n- **Score System**: Players gain or lose points based on actions (correctly combining items grants points, while incorrect combinations lead to point deductions).\n- **Movement and Obstacles**: The avatar can move past walls and will encounter locks that require keys to bypass.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe objective is to successfully prepare a plate of pasta by correctly combining raw pasta, sauce, and other ingredients while avoiding incorrect combinations that would lead to penalties.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win**: The player wins by successfully transforming ingredients to create a 'plateinplace' which represents the completed dish.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if they perform one incorrect combination that triggers the 'wrongplace' condition.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Before Each Move**: Take a moment to plan your moves. Observe the layout for key ingredients and materials needed to prepare the dish.\n\n2. **Focus on Key Ingredients**: \n   - **Collect the Key**: Ensure you first collect the key from its location with the avatar. This will allow you to unlock further paths if necessary.\n   - **Gather Raw Ingredients**: Prioritize collecting raw pasta and combining it with boiling water as it's crucial for starting the dish.\n\n3. **Correct Combinations**: \n   - Combine **rawpasta** with **boilingwater** to create **pastainplace** (gains 4 points).\n   - Then, combine **pastainplace** with **sauceinplace** to create the final **plateinplace** (gains 17 points).\n\n4. **Avoid Wrong Combinations**: Be careful with ingredient mixing. A wrong move (like combining raw pasta with tuna or tomato that doesn't lead to sauce) will lead to penalties and could cause you to lose if you reach the limit of 'wrongplace'.\n\n5. **Watch Out for Locks**: If you encounter a lock, remember that you need the key to proceed. Keep track of whether you\u2019ve already used the key to unlock paths.\n\n6. **Plan Your Path**: Since the map has walls, think ahead about each move to avoid running into obstacles that would force backtracking. \n\n7. **Iteration**: Use a trial-and-error method during your first attempts to explore what combinations lead to success and which lead to penalties, then refine your strategy based on your experiences.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can enhance your chances of submitting a well-prepared dish and ultimately winning the game. Stay observant and strategic in your moves!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
