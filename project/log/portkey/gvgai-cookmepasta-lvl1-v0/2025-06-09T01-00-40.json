Certain combinations yield positive results (like creating a dish), while others result in penalties (wrong placements).\n- **Score Changes:** Specific combinations result in points being added or deducted based on the interactions, incentivizing the player to explore successful ingredient pairings.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to transform the ingredients into a final dish, represented by the sprite 'plateinplace'. The player must navigate the level, utilize resources like the key, and avoid placing ingredients incorrectly.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Condition:** The player wins by successfully creating the 'plateinplace' dish, which involves correctly combining the cooked pasta with sauce.\n- **Losing Condition:** The player loses if they accumulate one instance of 'wrongplace', indicating a failed combination.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understanding Ingredient Combinations:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the interactions and their outcomes. Focus on combinations that yield positive scores and avoid those that lead to penalties.\n   - The goal is to create 'pastainplace' and 'sauceinplace' first, ultimately combining them for 'plateinplace'.\n\n2. **Resource Management:**\n   - Carefully manage resources like the 'key' to unlock new areas. The order in which you collect and use these resources is crucial for progress.\n\n3. **Avoiding Wrong Combinations:**\n   - Plan your moves carefully to avoid wrong combinations. Keep the mechanics of score changes in mind and think ahead about how the ingredients interact.\n\n4. **Utilizing the Environment:**\n   - Use the layout of the level to your advantage. Walls can restrict movement and force you to think about what paths to take, so be strategic about navigating around them.\n\n5. **Iterate and Explore:**\n   - Don\u2019t be afraid to try different combinations and backtrack if necessary. Exploring various interactions can reveal a deeper understanding of the game mechanics and might lead to optimal strategies.\n\nBy following these strategies and thoroughly understanding the mechanics, you can successfully navigate the level and achieve the win condition while maximizing your score. Enjoy cooking up those delicious dishes!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> a\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> #\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

I also need to avoid any wrong combinations, so I\u2019ll be cautious about my movement.\n\n### Action Plan\nI need to navigate the layout, considering the immediate proximity of raw pasta below my position. The avatar can move downwards to collect the raw pasta for further cooking.\n\nLet's take the following action: \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis chooses to move down, which places me directly next to the raw pasta, allowing for future combination potential. I expect this action aligns with my strategy of properly collecting ingredients to progress towards creating dishes.",
