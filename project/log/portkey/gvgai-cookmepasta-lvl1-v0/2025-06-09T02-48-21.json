Incorrect combinations (resulting in `wrongplace`) lead to points being deducted.\n- **Obstacle Elements**: Walls and locks add difficulty, as players must navigate around them and may need to collect keys to unlock certain areas.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to create a final dish (`plateinplace`) by successfully combining the right ingredients and tools while avoiding incorrect combinations that result in penalties.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having at least one `plateinplace`.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if there is ever a `wrongplace` transformation.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Ahead**: Before moving the avatar, assess the layout and plan the order of ingredient combinations wisely.\n2. **Avoid Wrong Combinations**: Familiarize yourself with the interactions to prevent generating `wrongplace` results, as just one instance leads to a loss.\n3. **Use Boiling Water**: Understanding how to use `boilingwater` effectively is key, as it is a critical component for transforming `rawpasta` into `pastainplace`. Be careful with subsequent interactions so it does not lead to penalties.\n4. **Conserve Resources**: The `key` should be collected as early as possible since it aids in unlocking areas and accessing more ingredients.\n5. **Layering Interactions**: After cooking pasta, strategically combine it with the sauce to form the final dish. Each successful combination should aim to maximize the score while steering clear of penalties.\n6. **Trial and Error**: Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations if there\u2019s room or if you reset after a loss\u2014this could help identify successful patterns for ingredient transformation.\n\nIn summary, the game requires careful navigation, awareness of the interaction rules, and strategic actions to create dishes while avoiding mistakes that can lead to instant losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n- The avatar (`a`) is located at (row 9, col 2).\n- The critical ingredient, `boilingwater`, is directly above the avatar at (row 9, col 1).\n- Next, there are free spaces surrounding the avatar, which provides room for movement.\n\n### Immediate Options\n1. **Action to Move Up to Boiling Water**: Moving the avatar up to (row 8, col 2) to collect `boilingwater` is the primary goal. Collecting boiling water will allow us to cook the `rawpasta` later.\n2. **Potential Next Steps**: After obtaining boiling water, we can assess potential moves to interact with other ingredients.\n\nGiven the rules and strategy, the optimal first action is to collect the boiling water directly above the avatar.\n\n### Selected Action and Feedback\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to succeed in moving the avatar up to collect boiling water, which is crucial for future interactions necessary for dish creation.",
