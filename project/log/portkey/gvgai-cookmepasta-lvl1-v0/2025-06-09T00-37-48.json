    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre**: \nThe game falls into the category of puzzle-platformers where players combine elements\u2014a mix of action, strategy, and problem-solving.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites and Their Functions**:\n   - **Avatar**: The chef (player character) moves and interacts with other items.\n   - **Key and Lock**: The key is collected by the avatar to unlock a lock, representing a way to continue progress.\n   - **Ingredients and Food**: These provide the core interaction mechanic where various ingredients can be combined or transformed.\n   - **Boiling Water**: Used to transform raw pasta into a ready-to-serve dish.\n   - **Score Changes**: Different combinations yield various scores, with some resulting in penalties.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Combining ingredients properly (raw pasta with boiling water) earns points.\n   - Incorrect combinations (e.g., raw pasta with ingredients other than boiling water) lead to score deductions.\n   - The level ends when the player successfully creates a plate of pasta (plateinplace) or messes up too many combinations (wrongplace).\n\n**Objective**:\nThe main goal is to create a plate of pasta by correctly interacting with ingredients and cooking methods. The player needs to avoid incorrect ingredient combinations that would lead to a score loss.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win Conditions**: Creating at least one plate of pasta (plateinplace).\n- **Loss Conditions**: Reaching the limit of one wrong placement (wrongplace).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Prioritize Collecting the Key**: Immediately head towards the key to unlock any potential obstacles up ahead. This is essential for progressing through the level.\n\n2. **Correct Ingredient Combinations**: Understand which ingredients interact favorably (e.g., raw pasta and boiling water) and focus on achieving these combinations first.\n\n3. **Avoid Wrong Combinations**: Carefully plan each move to minimize the chances of encountering 'wrongplace' status. For example, avoid mixing raw pasta with ingredients other than boiling water.\n\n4. **Utilize Resources Wisely**: Use the key to unlock areas that may contain beneficial resources or paths to prevent being locked behind walls or obstacles.\n\n5. **Watch the Score**: Keep an eye on your score. The goal is to reach a positive score while avoiding penalties from wrong combinations.\n\n6. **Path Management**: Plan movements around walls and obstacles to ensure you're not stepping back unnecessarily, especially after interacting with the lock.\n\n7. **Step-by-Step Progression**: Since it's a puzzle, advance sequentially by verifying each combination before moving further. Complete interactions and assess outcomes before proceeding.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game's interactions focus on transforming raw ingredients into completed dishes while avoiding mistakes. Understanding mechanics, practicing correct ingredient combinations, and strategically navigating to collect necessary resources are key components to success. Each decision directly influences the overall score and progression in the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> *\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> b\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> b\nrow=5, col=9 -> b\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> b\nrow=5, col=12 -> b\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> %\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> @\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> #\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> a\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
