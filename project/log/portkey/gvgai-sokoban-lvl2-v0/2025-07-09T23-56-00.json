Players must navigate obstacles and manipulate objects (boxes) within a confined space to achieve a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- The game involves several sprite types with specific behaviors:\n  - **Floor:** The basic ground where the avatar can move.\n  - **Hole:** A hazard that causes the avatar (or boxes) to be killed when the box falls into it, resulting in a score change.\n  - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that moves through the layout.\n  - **Box:** Passive objects that can be pushed and have a bounce effect when collided with by the avatar.\n  - **Wall:** Immoveable barriers that restrict movement and reflect interactions.\n  \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can't pass through walls but must navigate around them.\n  - The avatar bounces boxes on collision, which can be used to change their position strategically.\n  - Boxes can fall into holes, resulting in points being scored for the player.\n  - Moving a box into a wall will reverse that action, emphasizing the need for careful planning.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary goal is to remove all boxes from the level (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches zero) to win the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** All boxes must be manipulated and removed from play (count reaches zero).\n- **Loss Condition:** It appears that the game may impose penalties through the score system if boxes fall into holes, but the loss is not explicitly stated in the provided rules.\n\n### Possible Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**  \n   Before you start moving the avatar, take a moment to analyze the level layout. Note where the holes are located and identify the walls to understand how the boxes can be maneuvered.\n\n2. **Utilize Bouncing Wisely:**  \n   Since boxes bounce off the avatar, use this to your advantage. Push boxes in directions that lead them closer to holes without getting trapped by walls. Experiment with positioning to find effective strategies.\n\n3. **Avoiding Holes Initially:**  \n   While scoring points is beneficial, be cautious not to accidentally push boxes into holes too early. Focus on clearing all the boxes rather than purely increasing your score.\n\n4. **Manage Wall Interactions:**  \n   Be wary of the wall\u2019s impact. Avoid placing boxes against the walls excessively, as you may need to strategize around their layout.\n\n5. **Think in Layers:**  \n   With multiple layers of walls and open spaces, work systematically through the level, focusing on one section at a time, ensuring that boxes can be controlled without getting stuck in complex interactions.\n\n6. **Trial and Error:**  \n   Don't hesitate to experiment with different box movements. The game\u2019s mechanics allow for some leeway in repositioning boxes; use resets wisely to explore different strategies until you succeed.\n\nBy following these strategies, you should be able to systematically remove all boxes and win the game effectively!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> a\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",
