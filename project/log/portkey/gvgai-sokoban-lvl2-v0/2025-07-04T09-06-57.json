    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the video game described by the rules:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The player-controlled avatar pushes boxes.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The player must figure out how to move boxes around obstacles and into specific locations.\n*   **Limited Movement/Undo:** Boxes can only be moved by pushing, and the \"box wall box\" interaction suggests that getting boxes stuck can force a restart (undo).\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Get all the boxes into holes.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The win condition is met when there are no more boxes left on the board. `SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   Based on the rules, there is no explicit loss condition. However, if a box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall, the puzzle becomes unsolvable, effectively leading to a loss requiring a restart or level reset.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Before making any moves, carefully consider the positions of all boxes, holes, and walls. Think several steps ahead.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Getting a box into a corner is usually a bad idea because it severely limits the directions you can push it.\n3.  **Prioritize Key Boxes:** Some boxes may be more difficult to maneuver than others. Focus on moving these boxes first, before other boxes block their paths.\n4.  **Use Walls Strategically:** Walls can be used as leverage to change the direction a box is pushed, but be careful not to trap the box against the wall.\n5.  **Restart When Necessary:** Don't be afraid to restart the level if you realize you've made an irreversible mistake. The \"box wall box\" interaction suggests a possible mechanism to reset or undo the level.\n6.  **Exploit Hole Proximity:** Prioritize moving boxes closest to holes first, unless it hinders the movement of other boxes.\n\n**In simpler terms:** This is a box-pushing puzzle game where you need to shove all the boxes into the holes. Be careful not to get the boxes stuck! Plan your moves, and don't be afraid to start over if you mess up.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",
