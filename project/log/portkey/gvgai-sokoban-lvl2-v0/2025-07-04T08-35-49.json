Players are likely required to navigate through obstacles and solve spatial challenges to achieve a specific goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites & Movement:** The player controls an avatar (a knight) that can move and interacts with various objects (walls, boxes, holes) on the grid-like level layout.\n2. **Immovable Objects:** The 'floor,' 'hole,' and 'wall' sprites are fixed and cannot be moved by the avatar. They provide the boundaries and obstacles that the player has to navigate around.\n3. **Moving Objects:** The 'box' sprite can be bounced and interacts with other sprites to create effects (e.g., can kill the box upon falling into the hole).\n4. **Interactions:** \n   - The avatar cannot move through walls (step back when hitting a wall).\n   - The box bounces off the avatar, which can likely be used strategically to reposition boxes.\n   - If a box falls into a hole, it is removed from the level, and the player gains scores.\n   \n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective appears to be to eliminate all the boxes from the level\u2014once the count of boxes reaches zero, the player wins.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** All boxes must be either eliminated from the play area (usually by being pushed into holes).\n- **Loss Condition:** Not explicitly stated, but since the termination conditions involve the boxes, if the player is unable to push any box into a hole while still having boxes present, it might lead to a dead end (implied loss).\n\n**Strategy Suggestions:**\n1. **Plan Movement:** Carefully plan out your moves. Since the walls are immovable and represent fixed obstacles, you'll need to think ahead regarding how to move boxes into holes while preventing them from being stuck. \n2. **Use Bouncing Effectively:** Utilize the bouncing mechanic to reposition boxes or to position your avatar optimally. Avoid unnecessary movements to control the box movement.\n3. **Keep track of Boxes & Score:** Always mentally (or physically) track how many boxes remain. Try to prioritize pushing boxes that are easier to access first to avoid cluttering the playing area.\n4. **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be mindful of where you push boxes. Stacking them against walls might limit future moves if you aren\u2019t careful. Always have a clear path in mind before making a move.\n\nOverall, mastering the mechanics of interaction between the avatar, boxes, and holes will be critical to successfully completing levels and achieving victory in this puzzle/platformer game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> a\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",
