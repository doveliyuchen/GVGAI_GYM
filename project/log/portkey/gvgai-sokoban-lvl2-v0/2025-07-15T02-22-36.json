    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game:\n\n### **Game Genre**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle-based or strategy game, emphasizing spatial reasoning and movement mechanics. \n\n### **Game Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Represents the main playable area.\n   - **Wall**: Impassable obstacles which players must navigate around.\n   - **Hole**: A lethal area for boxes, where players can sacrifice them for points.\n   - **Box**: Movable objects that can be interacted with.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that moves throughout the level.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The **avatar** cannot move through walls (will step back).\n   - The **avatar** can push boxes; when this happens, the box will bounce forward.\n   - Boxes can collide with walls, but they revert to their previous positions if that occurs.\n   - If a box falls into a hole, the box is removed from play, and the player gains a score.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game is won when all boxes have been removed from play (when the sprite count of boxes reaches zero).\n\n### **Objective**\nThe objective of the game is to strategically maneuver your avatar to interact with the boxes, ultimately trying to get all the boxes into the holes while avoiding the walls and maximizing the score.\n\n### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes have been disposed of in the holes, leading to a win.\n- **Loss Condition**: There are no explicit loss conditions described, but poor decisions could lead to being stuck or running out of moves (if that mechanic exists).\n\n### **Overall Strategy**\n1. **Plan Moves**: Before making moves, assess the layout and the potential outcomes of pushing boxes. It\u2019s important to think a few steps ahead to avoid getting trapped by walls.\n \n2. **Utilize Holes Effectively**: As placing boxes in holes yields points, prioritize setting up boxes to fall into them efficiently. Keep track of the number of boxes you need to get rid of to win.\n\n3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Moves**: Try to minimize the number of bounces or interactions that don't benefit your strategy (like pushing boxes against walls unnecessarily).\n\n4. **Sequential Moves**: Focus on moving boxes in a sequential manner. For example, if a box is near a hole, consider how to position the avatar to push it in without getting stuck.\n\n5. **Maximize Space**: Keep the areas around the boxes open so you can move freely. Blocked paths may hinder your ability to reach holes easily.\n\nBy using these strategies, players can increase their chances of victory while maintaining control over the level layout and progressing through the puzzles effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is positioned at (3, 2) and there are two boxes nearby at positions (3, 1) and (2, 5).
