    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, a Sokoban-like puzzle)\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The core mechanic is pushing boxes. The avatar can push boxes.\n*   **Immovable Objects:** Walls and holes are static elements of the level.\n*   **Limited Movement:** The avatar cannot pass through walls.\n*   **Box-Wall-Box Collision:** When two boxes collide on a wall, the level state resets (likely goes back to the previous state).\n*   **Box in Hole = Score & Removal:**  Pushing a box into a hole removes the box from the level and increases the score.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Eliminate all boxes from the level by pushing them into holes.\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The player wins when there are no more boxes remaining on the level.\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   There is no explicit loss condition defined in the rules, implying the player can always reset or undo moves (through the box-wall-box interaction) to avoid getting stuck. So the player can keep playing until they solve it or give up.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `.`: Empty Floor\n*   `0`: Hole\n*   `1`: Box\n*   `A`: Avatar Start Position\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:**  Sokoban-style games require careful planning. Think several moves ahead before pushing a box.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Boxes pushed into corners are often impossible to retrieve.\n3.  **Prioritize Accessible Boxes:** Focus on boxes that are easy to maneuver first. Don't block yourself in!\n4.  **Utilize Undo/Reset:** The \"box wall box\" interaction is basically an \"undo\" or \"reset\" feature. Don't be afraid to use it to correct mistakes or experiment with different approaches.\n5.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Determine narrow passages or areas where movement is restricted early on. These will likely be the most challenging parts of the puzzle.\n6.  **Hole Prioritization:** Consider the position of the holes relative to the boxes. Try to line up boxes with holes in a way that allows efficient pushing.\n\nIn essence, this game is about spatial reasoning, planning, and careful execution. It's a classic puzzle formula where you have to manipulate objects in a confined space to achieve a specific goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",
