Here\u2019s a breakdown of its key components and how you might approach playing it:\n\n1. Game Genre and Objective\n\u2003\u2022 Genre: Puzzle/strategy, similar in spirit to Sokoban.\n\u2003\u2022 Objective: Remove all boxes from the level by pushing them into holes. When every box has been pushed into a hole (and therefore \u201ckilled\u201d), you win the level.\n\n2. Core Mechanics\n\u2003\u2022 Movement: You control an avatar (a knight sprite) who moves around the level.\n\u2003\u2022 Obstacles: Walls serve as immovable barriers that you cannot pass through.\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes: These are passive objects that can be pushed by bumping into them. When you push a box, it bounces forward.\n\u2003\u2022 Holes: When a box is pushed into a hole, it\u2019s removed from play and you gain score points.\n\u2003\u2022 Chain Reactions: There\u2019s an interaction where if one box comes in contact with a wall while another box is positioned next to the wall (box wall box), the game will trigger an \u201cundoAll\u201d \u2013 essentially resetting recent moves. This forces you to plan your pushes carefully.\n\n3. Win/Loss Conditions\n\u2003\u2022 Win: You win the level when no boxes are left on the board.\n\u2003\u2022 Loss/Reset: Making a move that results in a box colliding with a wall and another box (the \u201cbox wall box\u201d scenario) causes an undo of your moves. Although it isn\u2019t an outright loss, it disrupts your plan and can set you back considerably.\n\n4. Overall Strategy\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Your Moves: Think several steps ahead about where each box will end up. Since accidental misplacement can trigger a reset, careful positioning is key.\n\u2003\u2022 Manage Space: Use the open floor effectively while avoiding cramped spaces next to walls where accidental double-box collisions could occur.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the Bounce Mechanic: When you push a box and it \u201cbounces forward,\u201d know its path and where it\u2019s likely to land. Adjust your avatar\u2019s position accordingly to avoid causing unwanted interactions.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Chain Triggers: Stay alert to the \u201cbox wall box\u201d scenario. This means if you see a box already close to a wall with another box in line, try to clear that arrangement before pushing into that zone.\n\u2003\u2022 Experiment and Undo Wisely: Given that you can \u201cundoAll\u201d undesirable moves, use this mechanic as a tool to learn the correct sequence when planning your box moves. Sometimes a trial-and-error approach is necessary to understand the puzzle\u2019s layout.\n\nIn summary, the game challenges you to think strategically about spatial relationships and movement. By carefully planning your pushes and being attentive to how boxes interact with walls and holes, you can methodically clear the stage and secure a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> a\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",
