    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing Blocks:** The core mechanic revolves around pushing boxes (`box`) around the level using the avatar.\n*   **Level Solving:** The goal appears to be strategically positioning boxes to achieve a specific objective.\n*   **Immovable Obstacles:** Walls (`wall`) and holes (`hole`) act as obstacles, shaping the player's movement and the possible paths for the boxes.\n*   **Limited Movement/Bounces:** Based on interactions with `avatar` and `wall`, the `box`'s movement is limited to single pushes at a time.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   Get rid of all boxes on the map\n\n**Win Condition:**\n\n*   The player wins when there are no more boxes (`box`) remaining on the level (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`).\n\n**Loss Condition:**\n\n*   Implicitly, there doesn't appear to be a *defined* loss condition, but it's possible to create a situation where the puzzle is unsolvable (e.g., a box gets stuck in a corner). This is common in puzzle games.\n\n**Sprite Behavior Breakdown:**\n\n*   `floor`: Simple passable space.\n*   `hole`: Destination for the `box` which increases the score when a box falls in.\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character that pushes boxes.\n*   `box`: The object the player must manipulate.\n*   `wall`: Impassable barrier. The `autotiling=True` suggests that visually, walls will connect with each other.\n\n**Interaction Breakdown:**\n\n*   `avatar wall > stepBack`: The avatar can't move through walls and will be stopped upon contact.\n*   `box avatar > bounceForward`: The avatar pushes the box.\n*   `box wall box > undoAll`: This interaction suggests that if a box is pushed against a wall with another box behind it, the action is undone.\n*   `box hole > killSprite scoreChange=1`: If a box is pushed into a hole, the box is removed from the game and the score increases by 1.\n\n**Level Layout Insights:**\n\n*   **'w'**: Represents walls.\n*   **'.'**: Represents floors.\n*   **'0'**: Represents holes.\n*   **'1'**: Represents boxes.\n*   **'A'**: Represents the starting position of the avatar.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Hole Placement:** Carefully assess the location of the holes. These are the targets for the boxes.\n2.  **Plan Box Movements:** Visualize the possible paths for each box. Consider the walls as boundaries and plan a route to a hole.\n3.  **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be extremely careful not to push a box into a position where it can't be moved anymore. This could make the puzzle unsolvable.\n4.  **Use 'UndoAll' Wisely:** The `box wall box > undoAll` interaction indicates some kind of \"undo\" mechanism.\n5.  **Consider the Order of Operations:** The order in which you push the boxes will likely be crucial.\n6. **Maximize Score:** Try to get every box into a hole since it affects the score.\n\nIn essence, this is a Sokoban-like puzzle game with a focus on pushing boxes into holes. The limited movement and the potential for creating unsolvable states will require careful planning and execution.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nbox floor -> '@'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> w\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> 0\nrow=2, col=4 -> a\nrow=2, col=5 -> @\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> @\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> 0\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> w\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> 0\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w",
