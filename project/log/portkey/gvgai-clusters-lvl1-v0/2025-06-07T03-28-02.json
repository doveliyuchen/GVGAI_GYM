The avatar could move freely, while other sprites have specific interactions defined (e.g., stepping back when colliding with walls, transforming when interacting with boxes).\n- **Transformation and Scoring**: The game features transformation mechanics where certain colored boxes change into blocks, contributing to the player's score. Correct combinations of boxes can yield higher scores (e.g., a blue box interacting with a blue block increases the score).\n- **Destructive Interactions**: The 'hole' sprite is lethal to the avatar, indicating a loss condition if the avatar falls into it. Additionally, certain interactions can result in the transformation of boxes into a 'broken box', likely representing a loss of utility.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary goal is to **eliminate all boxes** from the level, as indicated by the win condition being the sprite counter for boxes reaching 0.\n- Additionally, players must avoid having the avatar counter reach 0, as this results in a loss.\n- Players may need to use time wisely with a timeout limit of 1500, which adds pressure to complete objectives efficiently.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: All boxes must be collected or transformed into the 'broken box', which implies reducing the box counter to zero.\n- **Lose**: If the avatar's sprite counter drops to zero, or if a broken box exists on the field alongside failing to complete the level within the time limit.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Plan Movements**: Start by surveying the level layout and identifying the positions of boxes and holes. Positioning your avatar to collect boxes while avoiding holes should be a priority.\n\n2. **Use Box Interactions**: Leverage the bouncing and transforming interactions that the boxes have with each other. Try to maximize the score by chaining box transformations effectively.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes and Walls**: Always be cautious of wall encounters which lead to setbacks. Also, ensure that you meticulously avoid the holes, which can be game-ending obstacles.\n\n4. **Manage Transformations Wisely**: Be conservative with how you interact with boxes. Since multiple interactions can lead to 'undoing' previous changes, maintaining control over these transformations can be key to achieving the win condition.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on your timer. While focusing on strategic plays, ensure that you are moving efficiently enough to complete the level before time runs out.\n\nIn summary, the game requires careful planning and execution of moves, understanding the mechanics of box interactions, and effective time management to meet the objectives. Balancing the strategy between score optimization and avoiding lethal sprites is crucial for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> a\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
