This genre often emphasizes logic and strategic interactions rather than combat.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - **Floor, Hole, Blocks, and Walls:** These represent the basic elements of the game world, where the floor is passable, holes are lethal, blocks are obstacles, and walls stop movements.\n   - **Boxes:** Boxes can be used strategically; they can bounce the avatar or transform into different types of blocks when interacting with colored boxes.\n   - **Colored Blocks:** These blocks can be transformed and interact with each other to affect the game state.\n\n2. **Interactions:** \n   - The avatar can interact with other sprites to achieve changes: stepping back when hitting walls or blocks, transforming boxes, and losing points when hitting holes.\n   - The elimination of boxes and transformations of blocks are central to advancing in the game.\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, creating momentum and positioning opportunities.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:** \n   - The game ends with specific conditions related to the avatar, the boxes, and the occurrence of broken boxes or a timeout.\n\n### Game Objective\n- The primary objective is to eliminate all boxes in the level, signified by the win condition where the count of boxes reaches zero.\n- Players must avoid the holes while managing the interactions of the colored blocks strategically.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - All boxes must be transformed or eliminated (boxes count reaches zero).\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar reaching a limit of zero (the avatar is killed).\n  - A broken box appearing in the game.\n  - Running out of time (timeout).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Interactions:**\n   - Carefully observe the layout and plan out the interactions between the boxes and colored blocks. This will help you transform boxes into blocks effectively.\n   \n2. **Avoid Holes:**\n   - Stay aware of the positions of the holes to avoid stepping into them, as they result in a loss of points and could lead to loss conditions.\n\n3. **Leverage Bouncing:**\n   - Use the bouncing mechanic to your advantage to position the avatar correctly and explore potential moves that could eliminate boxes.\n\n4. **Keep Track of Box Limitations:**\n   - Since the number of boxes is paramount to the win condition, keep a close count of how many are left and what your options are for eliminating them.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Expect that some interactions may not lead to immediate success; use trial and error to learn from mistakes, especially with box transformations.\n\n6. **Act Swiftly but Thoughtfully:**\n   - While time isn\u2019t explicitly a restriction, working efficiently will help you prevent reaching undesirable outcomes like running out of time or causing unintended sprite interactions.\n\nBy understanding these mechanics, players can develop a strategic approach to effectively complete levels in this puzzle-platforming game while navigating the various interactions present in the game world.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, we see that we have the avatar positioned at (7, 6) with several important elements around it. Specifically, there are two holes at (5, 8) and (3, 8) directly above, a green block at (2, 8) to the right, and various boxes scattered throughout.\n\n### Current Avatar Position: (7, 6)\n\nConsidering the available actions:\n\n1. **Left (7, 5)**: This is a free floor space, which can be a safe move.\n2. **Right (7, 7)**: This is also a free floor space, another safe move.\n3. **Down (8, 6)**: A free floor space as well, moving down is safe.\n4. **Up (6, 6)**: There is a green block here, which may involve interactions that require careful consideration.\n\nSince we need to minimize risk and optimize our strategy, let's analyze the consequences of each action:\n\n- Going **LEFT** or **RIGHT** keeps the avatar on free spaces.\n- **DOWN** also remains on free spaces.\n- **UP** could potentially result in interactions with a block.\n\nGiven that the avatar did not change position in the last check, an effective strategy would be to move towards one of the available safe spaces. With two available options (left and right), they offer no immediate advantage beyond safety, while moving **UP** towards the green block may provide more opportunities to interact and potentially eliminate boxes or modify gameplay.\n\nHowever, the optimal action here could be a **LEFT** move since it keeps options open for the next turn without jumping into the unknown interactions up above.\n\nThus, I choose to:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis keeps the avatar on a safe floor space and maintains strategic flexibility for future moves. I expect this strategic move to help explore the level further without risking immediate interactions that might be disastrous.",
