    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nBased on the elements described (sprites, interactions, walls, boxes, and the avatar), this game can be classified as a **puzzle/platformer**. The player likely navigates through a grid-like environment filled with obstacles and interactive objects.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- The player controls an **avatar** (the knight) that can move within the confines of the game world.\n- The game world consists of various sprites, including blocks, boxes, walls, holes, and ports.\n- The player can interact with these sprites in specific ways: \n  - Stepping back when hitting walls or blocks.\n  - Bouncing off boxes.\n  - Transforming boxes into colored blocks.\n  - Encouraging interactions between blocks to achieve certain outcomes, such as scoring points or eliminating boxes.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe primary goal is to clear the game area of all boxes (collectively) while preventing the loss of the avatar. Achieving this results in a victory.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by eliminating all boxes (`box`) from the game area.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter limit for avatar reaches zero) or the timeout of 1500 is reached without clearing the boxes. Having broken boxes in the environment also contributes to a loss condition.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Plan Movement:** \n   - Carefully analyze the layout and plan your movements to avoid collisions with walls and holes.\n   - Prioritize moving towards boxes and consider how each interaction can help you eliminate them.\n\n2. **Utilize Box Interactions:** \n   - Take advantage of the box bouncing mechanic to get the boxes into advantageous positions.\n   - Be strategic about transforming boxes into colored blocks to clear spaces and manage their transformations effectively.\n\n3. **Manage Points:** \n   - Keep track of which interactions yield positive points. Favor interactions that change color blocks as this will help clear boxes and avoid penalties.\n   - Avoid harmful interactions with holes and ensure that the avatar is kept safe from them while navigating.\n\n4. **Monitor Time:** \n   - Keep an eye on the timer (1500) and ensure you are progressing towards the goal of clearing boxes. If time runs out, it results in a loss.\n\n5. **Explore Patterns:**\n   - Look for patterns in how boxes interact with one another (i.e., blue, red, green) to maximize moves and maintain the benefit of these transformations, leading to more efficient clearing strategies.\n\nBy taking a strategic approach to the interactions and maintaining a clear focus on objectives and possible outcomes, the player can navigate through the game's challenges effectively while optimizing for the best possible score and eventual win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
