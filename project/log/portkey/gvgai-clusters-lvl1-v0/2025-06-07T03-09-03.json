Players navigate a space with an avatar, interacting with a variety of blocks and obstacles to achieve a specific goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- The player controls an avatar that can move and interact with numerous sprites:\n  - **Immovable Sprites:** These include walls that block movement, holes that cause the avatar to lose a life, and other blocks that can change states.\n  - **Movable Sprites:** Various types of boxes that can bounce, transform, or break depending on their interactions.\n- The interactions between sprites lead to transformations (e.g., boxes turning into specific colored blocks) or consequences (e.g., the avatar moving back or losing lives).\n- The player can \"undo\" certain actions by manipulating specific combinations of boxes.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to eliminate all boxes from the level (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0). The player must navigate the avatar and manipulate blocks to successfully transform or eliminate boxes while avoiding hazards like holes and managing their interactions with other blocks.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:**  \n  - The player wins if all boxes are removed from play.\n- **Loss Conditions:**  \n  - The player loses if:\n    - The avatar count reaches zero (i.e., the avatar is killed).\n    - There is at least one broken box in play when conditions lead to this situation.\n    - A timeout occurs, where the player runs out of time (1500 units).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Before moving, analyze the layout and the interaction possibilities between the boxes and blocks. Understanding how they will react to each other will allow for efficient removal of boxes.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Box Removal:** Focus on boxes first\u2014try to get them to transform into their respective colored blocks using blue, red, and green boxes. Keep track of interactions that can lead to their removal.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Be cautious of the holes that will cause the avatar to lose a life. Moving adjacent to these should be done with a strategy to avoid falling in.\n\n4. **Utilize Bouncing Effectively:** Leverage the bouncing mechanic when interacting with boxes to create favorable conditions that allow multiple boxes to be transformed or eliminated at once.\n\n5. **Prevent Backtracking:** Be mindful of the \"stepBack\" mechanics that occur when colliding with certain blocks or obstacles\u2014try to limit situations where the avatar is forced to backtrack, as this can lead to potential dead ends.\n\n6. **Watch Time Limits:** Keep an eye on the time limit to ensure you\u2019re progressing efficiently through the level. Avoid getting stuck or spending too long on a single area.\n\n7. **Solve Undo Scenarios:** When faced with combinations that trigger the undo effect, think critically about whether that is beneficial. Sometimes allowing a situation to occur might help you reset unwanted configurations.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith careful planning, awareness of the game mechanics, and strategic movement, players can successfully navigate levels, eliminate boxes, and avoid pitfalls that lead to loss. Each interaction opens a multitude of possibilities that require players to think creatively and adaptively, a hallmark of the puzzle-platformer genre.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
