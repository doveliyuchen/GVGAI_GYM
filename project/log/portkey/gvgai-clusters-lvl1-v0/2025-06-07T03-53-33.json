It involves manipulating various block types and dealing with physics-based interactions to achieve a specific goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: \n  - The game features different types of sprites, including immovable elements like walls and the floor, and movable elements like the avatar and boxes.\n  - There are blocks that come in different colors (blue, red, and green), and they can transform based on interactions with their corresponding boxes.\n  - The avatar can interact with blocks and boxes, which leads to different outcomes (e.g., stepping back, bouncing forward, transforming blocks).\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can push or interact with boxes, transforming them into colored blocks that affect the game state positively (score changes) or negatively (causing reversals).\n  - Falling into the holes leads to the avatar's loss of score, indicating a penalty for poor movement choices.\n  - The total number of boxes needs to be reduced to zero for a win, while broken boxes count against the player.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to manipulate the boxes in such a way that all boxes are eliminated from the play area. The player must strategize movements to achieve this within the given time limit of 1500 ticks.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Successfully eliminating all boxes (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0).\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar\u2019s sprite count dropping to zero, which indicates a game over state.\n  - Having at least one broken box present when the player needs to remove all boxes also leads to a loss.\n  - Exceeding the specified timeout limit without achieving the objectives results in a loss.\n\n#### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Movements**:\n   - Since movement causes various reactions, plan the avatar's movements carefully. Moving into a wall causes a bounce back which could disrupt strategies.\n  \n2. **Use Transformations Wisely**:\n   - Utilize the transformations effectively. Combining colored boxes with their corresponding blocks leads to positive scoring, which can be crucial for maintaining a buffer against potential losses.\n\n3. **Avoiding Holes**:\n   - Be very cautious around holes, as falling into one affects your score negatively. Always plan a safe path through the level to avoid accidental falls. \n\n4. **Clearing Boxes**:\n   - Focus on clearing the boxes efficiently. Prioritize actions that lead to the transformation of boxes into colored blocks that can be dealt with or removed from the board.\n\n5. **Keep an Eye on the Count**:\n   - Monitor the counts on boxes and broken boxes; ensure you do not flounder into a situation where you are left with broken boxes as this indicates a point of no return.\n\n6. **Destructive Interactions**:\n   - Use the interactions of boxes with walls and holes strategically to trigger undo actions when necessary, allowing you to set up new configurations of boxes and creating new paths toward victory.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe game requires logical thinking and spatial awareness to navigate through the puzzle-like environment. Mastering the interactions and planning movements effectively will ensure a higher chance of clearing all the boxes and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> a\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar 'a' is located at (8, 5). The surrounding cells include holes, walls, and various types of boxes.\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n1. **Current Location**: Your avatar is at the floor level, surrounded by empty tiles and holes below at (5, 5), (6, 5), and (7, 5) which must be avoided.\n2. **Boxes and Blocks**: There are green boxes ('%'), blue boxes ('#'), and red blocks ('*') around the area that can be manipulated to fulfill the win condition of clearing all boxes. \n3. **Victory Condition**: The goal is to eliminate all boxes, currently, there are green boxes and blue boxes present, while the surrounding holes pose a risk if approached incorrectly.\n\n### Optimal Move Selection:\nTo begin, the best action is to move your avatar up to (7, 5). Moving upwards is viable as it brings you closer to multiple boxes and potentially sets up for further moves next turn.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move places you in a better position to interact with the boxes while avoiding the holes below. I expect to see new strategic possibilities arise with boxes that can be manipulated next turn.",
