    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fall under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players control an avatar (likely a character) that navigates a grid-based environment while managing interactions with various objects to manipulate the game state and achieve specific goals.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - Various immovable objects (floor, walls, holes) and blocks of different types (blue, red, green) that interact with the avatar and each other.\n   - The avatar can only move and interact with items on the grid.\n   - The avatar can push or bounce off certain objects, transforming others (like boxes to blocks) for scoring.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can collide with different objects, which lead to specific consequences (e.g., pushing, bouncing, transforming).\n   - Some combinations of boxes lead to the undoing of previous actions, creating complex puzzles that must be navigated carefully.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**: \n   - The game concludes when the avatar is eliminated, all boxes are converted into broken boxes, or a timeout occurs.\n   - Success is achieved by reaching a state where all boxes are transformed effectively, while failure occurs through timeout or loss of the avatar.\n\n### Game Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to transform all the boxes into another type (likely 'broken box') by successfully navigating the level and interacting with objects in the correct manner. After all boxes are transformed, a win condition is achieved.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes are transformed (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0).\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n   - The avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n   - A timeout condition occurs (limit=1500).\n   - Presence of broken boxes limits successful outcomes.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions**: Familiarize yourself with how different colors of blocks and boxes interact. Certain combinations either yield points or revert progress, so strategizing interactions is key.\n\n2. **Plan Movements**: Since the avatar can only move in response to other sprites, be aware of positioning. Avoid unnecessary interactions with walls that push you back and try to keep momentum forward toward actionable items.\n\n3. **Prioritize Boxes**: Focus on transforming boxes as quickly as possible. Each box interaction can potentially help rearrange placement and lead to the proper blocks for transformation.\n\n4. **Manage Time and Resources**: Keep an eye on the timer while also managing the number of boxes and their transformations. If a particular strategy isn\u2019t yielding results, adapt your approach to prevent a timeout loss.\n\n5. **Experiment with Undoing**: Make use of undo mechanics when pushing boxes together. Sometimes creating a situation where you can undo moves allows for better outcomes, so use this strategically to your advantage.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the game's mechanics, players can navigate through puzzles successfully and meet the game\u2019s objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> a\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is located at (row=7, col=6). The adjacent sprites around the avatar are:\n\n- Up (row=6, col=6): Empty (.)\n- Down (row=8, col=6): Empty (.)\n- Left (row=7, col=5): Block (|)\n- Right (row=7, col=7): Empty (.)\n\nThe strategic objective in this environment is to transform boxes (currently, there are blue boxes at (row=2, col=3) and (row=7, col=9) that can be interacted with to achieve victory).\n\n1. At the moment, the avatar can either move left to encounter a box or move in one of the other directions (up, down, or right) where there are either empty spaces or blocks that do not enable further progress toward the objective.\n\n2. Moving left to the block (row=7, col=5) appears strategically sound, as there are no immediate blocks to push or obstacles preventing the avatar from exploring further options afterward.\n\n3. The next action should be moving left toward the block.\n\nHere's the action based on this analysis:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action positions the avatar near a block and opens up further navigation possibilities while approaching a more interactive element in the puzzle.",
