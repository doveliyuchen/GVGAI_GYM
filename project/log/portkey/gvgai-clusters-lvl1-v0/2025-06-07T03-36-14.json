The gameplay revolves around strategy, movement, and transforming objects, which are key characteristics of both puzzles and platforming games.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- The player controls an avatar that can move around the level.\n- The environment consists of various immovable and movable blocks, walls, holes, and boxes.\n- Interactions between the avatar and other sprites lead to specific outcomes, such as bouncing back or transforming objects.\n- Objects can change types, score points, or lead to victory conditions based on how they interact.\n- There are special sprites such as the 'hole' that acts as a game over condition if the avatar interacts with it, and broken boxes that may represent obstacles or objective items.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal of the game is to eliminate all boxes (represented as 'box' sprites) from the game environment. The game is won when the player successfully transforms all boxes into the broken box state before they run out of time or avatars.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** \n  - All boxes transformed into broken boxes (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0)\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar is removed (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n  - One or more broken boxes remain in play (MultiSpriteCounter stype=brokenBox limit=1).\n  - The player runs out of time (Timeout limit=1500).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Manage Movement Carefully:** Avoid stepping into walls or holes. Such interactions lead to penalties or immediate game over.\n2. **Utilize Box Bouncing:** Use the 'box' interactions strategically. Bounce off other boxes to change their state while ensuring you don't accidentally create unwanted outcomes (like transforming boxes into broken ones unnecessarily).\n3. **Transform Boxes Wisely:** Focus on combining boxes with their respective blue, red, and green variants to yield point gains and move closer to victory. \n4. **Maintain Awareness of Sprites:** Keep track of the location and type of every sprite on the board. Knowing which boxes can interact favorably can save you from transforming them into broken boxes.\n5. **Plan for Time Management:** Keep an eye on the timer. Since there is a limit, it\u2019s essential to balance taking calculated risks while transforming boxes and maintaining pace.\n6. **Undo Actions Strategically:** Use the undo mechanisms effectively but sparingly. Most interactions reset to the last condition, allowing for selective rewinding of mishaps.\n\nThis game requires careful planning and strategic interactions, balancing between actionable moves and the risk of losing game pieces. Focus on both gradual transformation and avoiding pitfalls, and you'll increase your chances of securing victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",
