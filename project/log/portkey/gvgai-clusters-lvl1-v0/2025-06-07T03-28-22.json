Players navigate through a variety of obstacles and must manipulate blocks and boxes to reach an objective, engaging both problem-solving and timing skills.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:**\n   - The game consists of various immovable and movable sprites (e.g., walls, floors, holes, blocks, boxes, and the avatar).\n   - The avatar can interact with different types of blocks (blue, red, green) and boxes to transform them and earn points.\n   - There are specific transformations that yield a score change, while some interactions simply result in the avatar stepping back or being penalized (e.g., falling into a hole).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - The primary goal is to eliminate all boxes within the level (SpriteCounter for boxes reaching zero).\n   - Players must navigate the level while managing the transformation and positioning of blocks and boxes.\n   \n3. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - You win the game if the count of boxes reaches zero.\n   - You lose if the avatar sprite count reaches zero (which likely occurs if the avatar falls into a hole).\n   - Additionally, you also lose if a broken box is present or if the player runs out of time.\n\n**Level Layout:**\n- The layout consists of walls that define the play area, with various objects represented. There are holes (indicating danger), blocks, and boxes arranged strategically throughout the level. The use of numbers likely indicates the positioning of specific objects or checkpoints in the level. \n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Exploration and Positioning:**\n   - Start by carefully exploring the environment. Take note of where boxes and blocks are located. Analyze which blocks can be transformed into what by using interaction rules.\n\n2. **Prioritize Box Management:**\n   - Focus on targeting boxes first since the ultimate objective is to eliminate them. Look for blue, red, and green boxes and manipulate them into their corresponding block forms to score points.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious around holes. Losing the avatar counts against you, so plan your movements to steer clear of these dangers.\n\n4. **Use Box Interactions Wisely:**\n   - Pay attention to how different boxes interact with each other. For instance, using combinations like \"box + box + wall\" should be avoided because it leads to undoing your progress.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer. Optimize your moves to ensure you are making progress without running out of time.\n\n6. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with the interactions as necessary. The combination of different boxes can have various outcomes that may not be immediately apparent.\n\nBy effectively managing your movement, making smart decisions regarding box transformations, and actively avoiding falling into traps, you will enhance your chances of completing the level successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> a\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is positioned at row 6, column 8 (denoted by 'a'). The objective is to eliminate all boxes in the level. \n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n- At the current position (6, 8), there is a bluebox (#).\n- I can interact with this bluebox to transform it into a score-giving block, which is essential for progress.\n- There are also holes around (5, 5) and (5, 8), which I need to avoid as they will lead to a loss if I fall into them.\n  \n### Strategy:\n1. Target the bluebox directly above my avatar (6, 8).\n2. Manipulate it into a block to achieve a score and potentially clear the level objectives faster.\n3. Always be careful of moving towards holes after the interaction.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince interacting with the bluebox involves moving upwards into the space of the bluebox (which will likely transform it), I will choose to move UP.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will allow me to engage with the bluebox, helping me to target the level's objective. I expect that this aligns with our strategy of prioritizing box management.",
