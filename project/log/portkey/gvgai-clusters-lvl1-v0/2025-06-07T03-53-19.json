Players must navigate an environment filled with obstacles and blocks, managing interactions to achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game contains various types of sprites, which represent the environment and objects. These include:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Such as walls and the floor.\n  - **Intermediary Blocks**: Such as colored blocks (red, blue, green) and boxes, which can change states or interact with one another.\n  - **Avatar**: Represents the player's character that can move and interact with the environment.\n  - **Holes**: Signifying areas that cause the player's avatar to \"die\" or reset, impacting the score negatively.\n\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar can bounce off the boxes and transform different colored boxes and blueblocks into their respective colors, gaining points.\n  - Colliding with walls causes a setback, and holes lead to losing points.\n  - Certain interactions can undo previous actions, indicating a need to think strategically about movements and interactions.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main goal is to manipulate the blocks and boxes to eliminate all boxes from the level (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 to win). Throughout the process, maintaining the sprite count of the avatar and avoiding losing conditions, such as running out of avatars or encountering too many broken boxes, is crucial.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- Win: Successfully remove all boxes from the level.\n- Loss: \n  - The avatar count reaches zero.\n  - More than one broken box exists, which seems to signify that players have failed to handle game mechanics properly.\n  - The game times out after a set period (1500 units).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before moving your avatar, always evaluate the possible interactions with blocks and boxes. Determine the effect of each move to avoid unintended consequences like being pushed back or causing unwanted box transformations.\n\n2. **Utilize Positive Interactions**: Focus on bouncing boxes to transform them into blue, red, or green blocks that will gain you points. Maximize your score while simultaneously achieving level objectives.\n\n3. **Be Wary of Holes and Walls**: Stay conscious of where the holes are located. Plan your path to avoid them, as they will not only kill your avatar but also hinder your overall progress.\n\n4. **Reduce Redundant Boxes**: Use boxes cleverly to eliminate them by jumping into the holes or positioning them strategically where their interactions will result in their removal.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timeout condition. If you're close to the limit, make sure to prioritize elimination of the boxes more urgently.\n\n6. **Undo Wisely**: Use the undo mechanic sparingly, as overactive undoing may lead to situations where it becomes difficult to progress.\n\nIn summary, the core gameplay revolves around solving puzzles through the intelligent manipulation of blocks while navigating pitfalls. The player must develop a refined approach to manage interactions while advancing strategically to win before time runs out or while preventing the avatar loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> %\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> b\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> a\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, we see that our avatar ('a') is positioned at (row 7, col 4). The (row, col) layout shows various types of blocks, boxes, and walls nearby, with significant obstacles like holes identified in the layout.\n\nIn the immediate surroundings of the avatar:\n- There are holes to the left and below it that could lead to the avatar's demise.\n- A blue box ('#') is located to the right at (row 7, col 9), and there are red boxes ('b') at (row 4, col 4) and (row 5, col 7), which we can target to remove.\n\nGiven that we must avoid holes and strategically interact with boxes, our best course of action, considering current obstacles, is to make an initial move to the right towards the blue box. This will hopefully trigger interactions to convert boxes into colors and eliminate them.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nMy expectation is that moving to the right will allow our avatar to interact with the blue box, making progress towards removing boxes from the level.",
