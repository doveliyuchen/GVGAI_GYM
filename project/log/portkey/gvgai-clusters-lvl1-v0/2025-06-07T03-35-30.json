Players control an avatar that interacts with various blocks and objects in a grid-based environment, solving challenges based on movement and object manipulation.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - The game features different types of sprites, including immovable walls (the 'wall'), holes that can cause the avatar to lose points (the 'hole'), various types of blocks and boxes (which can be transformed), and the main moving character (the 'avatar').\n   - A breakdown of the box and block types:\n     - Basic blocks (blueblock, redblock, greenblock) that can interact with box sprites.\n     - Boxes (bluebox, redbox, greenbox) that can transform into corresponding blocks and are involved in certain interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, transform boxes into blocks of different colors, and move backward when encountering walls or other blocks.\n   - Specific interactions can cause the avatar to \"step back\" or undo actions under certain conditions.\n\n3. **Scoring:**\n   - Points are awarded for successfully transforming boxes into blocks, while interacting with a hole results in a loss of points.\n\n4. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends when either the avatar dies (score reaches zero) or all boxes (sprites of type box) are transformed in a manner that satisfies the conditions for a win. Additionally, the presence of broken boxes can influence the game's outcome.\n   - A time limit is also imposed, which adds urgency to the gameplay.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to transform all boxes into blocks and avoid losing the avatar. Successfully transforming boxes into blocks while managing the interactions is critical to achieving victory.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** The game is won when all 'box' type sprites are transformed, and no boxes should be left untransformed.\n- **Loss:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed by interacting with a hole, if the avatar is removed or if a timeout occurs.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Manage Space Wisely:**\n   - Move carefully to avoid hitting walls or falling into holes. Each movement should be planned based on the layout.\n\n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:**\n   - Use the box sprites to create a pathway that allows easier movement and interactions with other blocks. Remember specific box transformations to manipulate their states strategically.\n\n3. **Prioritize Goals:**\n   - Focus on transforming boxes as this is critical for winning. Avoid interactions that lead to losing the avatar unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Plan for Undoing Actions:**\n   - Keep in mind the interactions that allow for undoing actions. Utilize them when stuck or if a move leads to a dead end.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the time limit. If time is running low, prioritize the nearest objectives and try to complete transformations efficiently to maximize scoring. \n\nBy adhering to these strategies while being mindful of the game\u2019s mechanics and termination conditions, players can effectively navigate through the levels and work toward victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbluebox floor -> '1'\nredbox floor -> '2'\ngreenbox floor -> '3'\nredblock floor -> 'b'\ngreenblock floor -> 'c'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueblock -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\ngreenblock -> '$'\ngreenbox -> '%'\nhole -> '&'\nredblock -> '*'\nredbox -> 'b'\nwall -> 'g'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> g\nrow=0, col=1 -> g\nrow=0, col=2 -> g\nrow=0, col=3 -> g\nrow=0, col=4 -> g\nrow=0, col=5 -> g\nrow=0, col=6 -> g\nrow=0, col=7 -> g\nrow=0, col=8 -> g\nrow=0, col=9 -> g\nrow=0, col=10 -> g\nrow=0, col=11 -> g\nrow=0, col=12 -> g\nrow=1, col=0 -> g\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> g\nrow=2, col=0 -> g\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> g\nrow=3, col=0 -> g\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> &\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> g\nrow=4, col=0 -> g\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> g\nrow=5, col=0 -> g\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> a\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> g\nrow=6, col=0 -> g\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> g\nrow=7, col=0 -> g\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> &\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> &\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> @\nrow=7, col=10 -> #\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> g\nrow=8, col=0 -> g\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> g\nrow=9, col=0 -> g\nrow=9, col=1 -> g\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> g\nrow=9, col=4 -> g\nrow=9, col=5 -> g\nrow=9, col=6 -> g\nrow=9, col=7 -> g\nrow=9, col=8 -> g\nrow=9, col=9 -> g\nrow=9, col=10 -> g\nrow=9, col=11 -> g\nrow=9, col=12 -> g",

    "content": "To determine the best action for the avatar, let\u2019s analyze the current state:\n\n- The avatar is positioned at (5, 3).\n- Surrounding the avatar, we have:\n  - Up (4, 3): floor (.)\n  - Down (6, 3): greenblock (%)\n  - Left (5, 2): floor (.)\n  - Right (5, 4): floor (.)\n\nThere are no immediate holes (h) or walls (g) in the vicinity of the avatar. We can potentially move to any of the adjacent spaces. \n\n### Objective Review:\nThe goal is to transform all 'boxes' (denoted as '#' or '1', '2', '3') into corresponding blocks. There is a blue box at (2, 3) that can be transformed, which is a priority.\n\n### Strategy Suggestions Considerations:\n1. We should avoid interacting with holes (currently below at (5, 5) and (5, 8)).\n2. We need to confirm that our movements aim towards transforming the boxes into blocks.\n3. There is a green block (represented by %) below at (6, 3) which the avatar can interact with.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- **ACTION_UP (4, 3):** Move to an empty space. This does not progress towards our goal.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (6, 3):** Moves to a green block (%), which we might consider for future moves.\n- **ACTION_LEFT (5, 2):** Also moves to an empty space.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (5, 4):** Moves to another empty space.\n\nGiven the available options and considering the current potential to interact with the green block is below, the logical movement will be downwards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action will allow the avatar to potentially interact with the block on the next turn, and it keeps the avatar clear of walls or holes, aligning with the overall strategy.",
