The walls create a maze that may require backtracking if you encounter traps, so planning your route can save time.\n\n2. **Avoiding Traps**: Identify the locations of traps early in the game. Move strategically to bypass traps safely, as they directly penalize you and reduce your chances of winning.\n\n3. **Optimize Movement**: Since the avatar can only step back when hitting a wall, make efficient moves; practice maneuvering through tight spots and ensure you don't get stuck in corners or looping paths that consume time.\n\n4. **Use Time Wisely**: Keep an eye on the remaining time (1000 units). Aim to explore quickly, aiming for the exit without unnecessary detours. Being mindful of time allows for a better response to unexpected events or obstacles.\n\n5. **Incremental Score Management**: Try to reach the exit with a positive score. Every point is significant, so avoid traps as they can put you in a losing position not only by lowering your score but also by potentially eliminating your avatar.\n\nBy following these strategies and maintaining a cautious approach, you can efficiently navigate through the game, maximizing your chances of reaching the exit while minimizing losses.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit -> '@'\ntrap -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> $\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> $\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> $\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> $\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> $\nrow=6, col=8 -> $\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> $\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> a\nrow=7, col=13 -> #\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> $\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> $\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> $\nrow=8, col=9 -> $\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> $\nrow=9, col=3 -> $\nrow=9, col=4 -> $\nrow=9, col=5 -> $\nrow=9, col=6 -> $\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> $\nrow=9, col=9 -> $\nrow=9, col=10 -> $\nrow=9, col=11 -> $\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> $\nrow=9, col=14 -> $\nrow=9, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> .\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=11, col=0 -> $\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> $\nrow=11, col=3 -> $\nrow=11, col=4 -> $\nrow=11, col=5 -> $\nrow=11, col=6 -> $\nrow=11, col=7 -> .\nrow=11, col=8 -> $\nrow=11, col=9 -> $\nrow=11, col=10 -> $\nrow=11, col=11 -> $\nrow=11, col=12 -> .\nrow=11, col=13 -> $\nrow=11, col=14 -> $\nrow=11, col=15 -> $\nrow=12, col=0 -> $\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> .\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> .\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> .\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> .\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> #\nrow=12, col=15 -> $\nrow=13, col=0 -> $\nrow=13, col=1 -> $\nrow=13, col=2 -> $\nrow=13, col=3 -> $\nrow=13, col=4 -> $\nrow=13, col=5 -> $\nrow=13, col=6 -> $\nrow=13, col=7 -> $\nrow=13, col=8 -> $\nrow=13, col=9 -> $\nrow=13, col=10 -> $\nrow=13, col=11 -> $\nrow=13, col=12 -> $\nrow=13, col=13 -> $\nrow=13, col=14 -> $\nrow=13, col=15 -> $",
