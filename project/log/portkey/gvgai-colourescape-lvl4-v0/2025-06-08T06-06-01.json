    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. The player navigates through a level, interacts with various elements, and must solve spatial challenges to progress. This genre typically involves both problem-solving and dexterity.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: \n  - There are various types of sprites including immovable objects (walls, floor), interactive elements (boxes, switches), and avatars (player characters).\n  - Different colored boxes likely have different effects based on the type of avatar interacting with them.\n  - The use of switches allows the player to transform their avatar, which may be crucial for solving specific challenges throughout the level.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - Players can interact with boxes to either bounce forward or undo all actions depending on their avatar color.\n  - Players can also kill their avatar upon falling into holes or successfully reach the exit to score points.\n  - The switches transform the avatar into different types, which may grant specific abilities or allow interaction with certain game elements.\n\n### Objective\n- The main goal is to navigate the level and reach the exit indicated by the green door, which will end the game and award points.\n- Players must also avoid falling into holes, which negatively impacts their score.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The game is won if the player\u2019s avatar reaches the exit before a set timeout (1500 units).\n- **Lose**: The player loses if either the avatar is eliminated (by falling into a hole) or if the time runs out, and they haven\u2019t reached the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Learn and Adjust**: Familiarize yourself with the behavior of each box type and avatar color. Understanding how different avatars interact with boxes can aid in creating effective strategies for moving through the level.\n\n2. **Optimal Pathing**: Plan your movements carefully. Use the bounce mechanics of boxes to traverse the level quickly, but be cautious as interacting incorrectly with other avatars can undo your progress.\n\n3. **Switches**: Pay attention to switches and use them strategically to change your avatar\u2019s type based on the obstacles ahead. Since different colored avatars can interact with boxes uniquely, this change can be crucial for progressing through the level.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Before jumping or moving, assess the environment for holes and walls in order to avoid instant loss. \n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Make sure not to get stuck on puzzles, and if you find yourself unable to progress, consider resetting and trying alternate paths.\n\n6. **Practice**: Since this involves many interactive elements, practice repeatedly can help in mastering the level layout and the specifics of avatar interactions.\n\nBy combining the principles above, players can approach the game thoughtfully, overcoming obstacles and effectively reaching the exit to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> n\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> h\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> n\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> g\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> n\nrow=3, col=16 -> n\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> g\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> #\nrow=6, col=16 -> %\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> n\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> n\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> #\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> r\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
