Players navigate through a grid-like environment, manipulating objects and characters to solve puzzles and reach an exit.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** Serves as the base where actions take place.\n   - **Exit:** The goal; players must reach this to win.\n   - **Holes:** Represent hazards that can remove the player's avatar from the game.\n   - **Boxes (Normal, Blue, Red, Green):** Interact differently with various avatars, affecting movement and outcomes.\n   - **Switches (Normal, Red, Blue, Green):** Change the avatar\u2019s type, which is likely important for solving puzzles.\n   - **Walls:** Provide boundaries for movement.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Different avatars have specific actions when interacting with boxes, affecting their movement forward or reverting previous actions.\n   - Interacting with the exit will result in winning, while falling into a hole leads to losing points or the game.\n   - Certain switches change the avatar type, which may be necessary for navigating through specific paths or encounters.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends either in victory by reaching the exit or in defeat through running out of avatars, hitting a hole, or timing out.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level safely, interact with boxes and switches, convert into appropriate avatars as needed, and ultimately reach the exit.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win:** Reach the exit while one or more avatars remain.\n- **Loss:** Fall into holes, exhaust all avatars, or timeout.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand Avatar Abilities:**\n   - Each avatar likely has unique interactions with boxes and switches. Familiarize yourself with these to effectively navigate obstacles. Using the correct avatar can change interactions, allowing for further movement or actions.\n\n2. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Before making moves, analyze the level layout to determine a pathway that minimizes risk of falling into holes or running out of avatars. Use walls and available boxes for potential safe routes.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Effectively:**\n   - Boxes can allow for forward movement but can also undo previous actions or lead to hazardous situations if not used wisely. Consider the timing and type of avatars needed when interacting with boxes to ensure progress.\n\n4. **Switch Wisely:**\n   - Switches should be used to transform into the required avatar to access certain areas or perform specific actions effectively. Assess the needs of your current position before interacting with a switch.\n\n5. **Be Mindful of Hazards:**\n   - Avoid falling into holes at all costs as they result in immediate penalties. Stay aware of placement and possible interactions with the environment.\n\n6. **Adapt to Errors:**\n   - If you make an error (like choosing the wrong box interaction), try to undo those decisions where possible. Use observations and anticipations of outcomes to improve subsequent attempts.\n\nBy combining these strategies with an understanding of the game's dynamics, players can improve their chances of successfully navigating levels and reaching the exit without depleting their avatars.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> e\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> n\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> h\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> n\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> g\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> n\nrow=3, col=16 -> n\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> g\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> #\nrow=6, col=16 -> %\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> n\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> n\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> #\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> r\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
