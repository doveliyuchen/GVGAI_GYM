Players control an avatar that interacts with various elements in a tile-based environment, using problem-solving skills to navigate levels and reach the exit while managing obstacles.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent the avatar, boxes, switches, holes, exits, and walls. The avatar can take on various forms based on the type of switch it interacts with.\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can bounce off certain boxes.\n  - It can change form by interacting with colored switches (normal, red, blue, green).\n  - Moving into a hole results in the loss, while reaching the exit scores points.\n  - Interaction with certain types of boxes can lead to undoing previous interactions with other avatars.\n- **Movement**: The avatar has a forward movement ability, and can step back when meeting walls. \n\n### Objective\n- The main objective is to navigate the levels, avoiding holes to prevent losing points while trying to reach the exit to gain points.\n- The player can achieve this by manipulating boxes and switches to create pathways or unlock the exit.\n  \n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The game is won when the avatar successfully reaches the exit (scoring 1 point).\n- The game is lost if:\n  - The avatar gets killed (e.g., falls into a hole).\n  - The number of avatars drops to zero (i.e., all avatars are eliminated).\n  - The time limit (1500 ticks) runs out.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Start by exploring the level to familiarize yourself with the layout, noting the location of switches, boxes, holes, and the exit.\n  \n2. **Switch Mechanism Use**: Utilize the color switches effectively. Changing the avatar\u2019s color can provide different bouncing capabilities with the respective boxes. Test interactions to understand how they affect your current avatar and how to use them to reach advantageous positions.\n\n3. **Box Management**: Be strategic with your interactions with boxes. Use the bouncing mechanic to propel yourself forward, but be cautious of other avatars\u2019 positions\u2014undoing previous actions might put you at a disadvantage.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes**: Pay close attention to the holes on the map and avoid them. If needed, plan your moves several steps ahead to ensure you do not fall into a hole while attempting to advance toward the exit.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit. Plan each move carefully and ensure that you are making progress towards the exit rather than getting stuck in loops of unnecessary interactions.\n\n6. **Observe Other Avatars**: If multiple avatars exist, observe their movements and interactions as they can either hinder or help your progress towards reaching the exit.\n\nBy employing a systematic approach to navigating through levels and making calculated decisions based on the game mechanics, players can enhance their chances of winning.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nbox -> '$'\nexit -> '%'\ngreenSwitch -> '&'\ngreenbox -> '*'\nhole -> 'b'\nnormalAvatar -> 'e'\nnormalSwitch -> 'g'\nredSwitch -> 'h'\nredbox -> 'n'\nwall -> 'r'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'w'\nblueAvatar -> 'f'\nnormalAvatar normalSwitch -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> r\nrow=0, col=1 -> r\nrow=0, col=2 -> r\nrow=0, col=3 -> r\nrow=0, col=4 -> r\nrow=0, col=5 -> r\nrow=0, col=6 -> r\nrow=0, col=7 -> r\nrow=0, col=8 -> r\nrow=0, col=9 -> r\nrow=0, col=10 -> r\nrow=0, col=11 -> r\nrow=0, col=12 -> r\nrow=0, col=13 -> r\nrow=0, col=14 -> r\nrow=0, col=15 -> r\nrow=0, col=16 -> r\nrow=0, col=17 -> r\nrow=1, col=0 -> r\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> n\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> r\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> *\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> r\nrow=2, col=0 -> r\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> h\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> n\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> r\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> *\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> r\nrow=3, col=0 -> r\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> g\nrow=3, col=14 -> *\nrow=3, col=15 -> n\nrow=3, col=16 -> n\nrow=3, col=17 -> r\nrow=4, col=0 -> r\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> r\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> $\nrow=4, col=14 -> $\nrow=4, col=15 -> *\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> r\nrow=5, col=0 -> r\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> b\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> *\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> r\nrow=6, col=0 -> r\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> r\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> i\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> b\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> #\nrow=6, col=16 -> %\nrow=6, col=17 -> r\nrow=7, col=0 -> r\nrow=7, col=1 -> &\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> *\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> r\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> r\nrow=8, col=0 -> r\nrow=8, col=1 -> n\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> $\nrow=8, col=6 -> n\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> &\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> #\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> &\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> r\nrow=9, col=0 -> r\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> g\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> *\nrow=9, col=9 -> r\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> r\nrow=10, col=0 -> r\nrow=10, col=1 -> r\nrow=10, col=2 -> r\nrow=10, col=3 -> r\nrow=10, col=4 -> r\nrow=10, col=5 -> r\nrow=10, col=6 -> r\nrow=10, col=7 -> r\nrow=10, col=8 -> r\nrow=10, col=9 -> r\nrow=10, col=10 -> r\nrow=10, col=11 -> r\nrow=10, col=12 -> r\nrow=10, col=13 -> r\nrow=10, col=14 -> r\nrow=10, col=15 -> r\nrow=10, col=16 -> r\nrow=10, col=17 -> r",
