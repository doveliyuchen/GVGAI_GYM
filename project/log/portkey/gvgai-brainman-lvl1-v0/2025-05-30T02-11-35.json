Consider pathways leading to doors, keys, and ultimately the exit while avoiding enemy gems.\n   - Plan movements to minimize encounters with gems and maximize scoring via gem collection.\n\n5. **Exit Strategy:**\n   - Once you secure a keym, assess the best route to the exit. The priority should shift to reaching the exit once possible, ensuring the fastest resolution of the game.\n\nBy approaching the game with these mechanics in mind, players can navigate the challenges effectively while optimizing for score and survival.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> a\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> b\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b\nrow=11, col=0 -> b\nrow=11, col=1 -> b\nrow=11, col=2 -> b\nrow=11, col=3 -> b\nrow=11, col=4 -> b\nrow=11, col=5 -> b\nrow=11, col=6 -> b\nrow=11, col=7 -> b\nrow=11, col=8 -> b\nrow=11, col=9 -> b\nrow=11, col=10 -> b\nrow=11, col=11 -> b\nrow=11, col=12 -> b\nrow=11, col=13 -> b\nrow=11, col=14 -> b",

(empty space)\n- The walls ('b') surround the area.\n\nHere's the layout of the immediate area around the avatar:\n```\nRow 1: \n(1, 1) -> w (keym) \n(1, 2) -> a \n(1, 3) -> . \n(1, 4) -> . \n```\n\n### Strategy:\nThe keym that is available will allow the avatar to \"kill\" doors. However, the objective is to find a way towards the exit (located at (10, 11)). \n\n### Immediate Actions:\n1. **Collect Keym**: The first step is to move to the left and collect the keym at (1, 1). This will be beneficial for opening doors later in the level.\n  \nChoosing to move left seems like the best action right now.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nCollecting the keym will empower the avatar for interactions with doors later, aligning with the strategy of key management.",
