    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and potential strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game can be classified as a **puzzle adventure** or **maze exploration** game. It involves exploration, item collection, and puzzles to overcome barriers.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and Interaction:**\n   - The player controls an avatar that interacts with various sprites, including walls, doors, keys, gems, and boulders.\n   - Collecting keys allows the avatar to unlock doors, while gems (colored red, green, and blue) can affect the score negatively depending on the color collected.\n   - The game features boulders that bounce the avatar and can be used in puzzle-solving.\n   - The exit condition requires the avatar to reach the exit sprite.\n\n2. **Transformations and Movement:**\n   - Collecting a key transforms it into a missile (keym), which can be used to kill both the door and the keym itself upon interacting with the door.\n   - The avatar can step back if it encounters walls or doors, indicating strategic planning in movement and positioning.\n\n3. **Score System:**\n   - Collecting gems adds to the score based on their color: red (5), blue (2), green (1).\n   - The goal is to maximize the score while trying to reach the exit for additional points (10).\n\n### Objective:\n- The main objective is to navigate through the level, collect items (gems and keys), and find the exit.\n- A secondary objective may include maximizing the score through careful collection of gems while avoiding harming the avatar.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins the game when the avatar reaches the exit sprite, with the sprite counter for exits reaching zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unsuccessfully if the avatar is eliminated (sprite counter for avatars reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Movement and Interactions:**\n   - Carefully plan the avatar's movement to avoid collecting negative score gems (especially green).\n   - Prioritize collecting keys for unlocking doors, as they are essential to progress.\n\n2. **Utilize Boulders:**\n   - Use boulders strategically for bouncing the avatar into key locations or clearing paths.\n\n3. **Focus on Scoring:**\n   - Balance collecting high-value red gems with avoiding the green gems to minimize score loss.\n   - Aim to activate the exit after achieving a satisfactory score.\n\n4. **Explore Thoroughly:**\n   - Explore the maze, looking for hidden paths and key locations to maximize the items available for collection.\n\nOverall, the player must balance puzzle-solving, item collection, and strategic movement to successfully navigate the maze, complete the game, and achieve a high score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> &\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> b\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b\nrow=11, col=0 -> b\nrow=11, col=1 -> b\nrow=11, col=2 -> b\nrow=11, col=3 -> b\nrow=11, col=4 -> b\nrow=11, col=5 -> b\nrow=11, col=6 -> b\nrow=11, col=7 -> b\nrow=11, col=8 -> b\nrow=11, col=9 -> b\nrow=11, col=10 -> b\nrow=11, col=11 -> b\nrow=11, col=12 -> b\nrow=11, col=13 -> b\nrow=11, col=14 -> b",

    "content": "In the current game state, my avatar 'a' is positioned at coordinates (6, 9). To formulate my next action, I need to analyze the layout and surrounding entities:\n\n- **Surrounding Tiles:**\n  - Up (5, 9): Empty (.)\n  - Down (7, 9): Wall (b)\n  - Left (6, 8): Empty (.)\n  - Right (6, 10): Empty (.)\n\nBased on the game mechanics, I have several possible actions.
