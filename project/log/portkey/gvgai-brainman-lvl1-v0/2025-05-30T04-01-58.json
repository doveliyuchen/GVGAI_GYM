    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the given rules and level layout, the game appears to be a puzzle-platformer featuring exploration, resource management, and strategic interaction with various objects within the game environment. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Game Genre:\n- **Puzzle-Platformer**: The game combines elements of platforming (navigating spaces and avoiding obstacles) with puzzle-solving (managing keys, gems, and doors).\n\n### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game includes various types of sprites (static and dynamic objects), such as walls, floors, doors, keys, gems (in different colors), boulders, the player's avatar, and an exit.\n- **Interactions**: The player interacts with these sprites to change the game's state. For example, collecting keys, bouncing off walls, and defeating sprites by colliding with gems or exiting the level.\n- **Scoring System**: The player scores points based on interactions, especially related to collecting gems and successfully exiting.\n\n### Objectives:\n- Navigate through the level, using the avatar to collect keys and gems.\n- Unlock or access the exit to finish the level while maximizing score through gem collection.\n  \n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the exit (sprite limit for exit becomes zero), netting 10 points.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero (meaning they are defeated), which would yield a loss condition.\n\n### Key Items:\n1. **Keys (key and keym)**: Essential for unlocking doors. The transformation from key to keym suggests that keys are used for specific interactions.\n2. **Gems**: Provides scoring opportunities when collected or interacted with. They have varying point values.\n3. **Exit**: The ultimate goal to reach and complete the level.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Explore the Level**: Take time to explore the map layout without rushing. Understand where each type of sprite is located, especially keys and gems.\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection**: Collect keys first, as they are crucial for unlocking doors and advancing through the level.\n3. **Avoid Dangerous Gems**: Be cautious of the green gem, which is detrimental to the avatar. Ensure you collect and interact with gem sprites deliberately.\n4. **Utilize Boulders Wisely**: If boulders are in play, there may be opportunities to use them strategically to bounce and access other parts of the level, or to protect against threats.\n5. **Plan Your Route**: Since this is a puzzle game, planning out your route based on interactions can save time and lives. Determine how many keys you need and what doors you plan to open.\n6. **Maximize Score**: If time and conditions allow, focus on collecting as many gems as possible while navigating to the exit to maximize your score before completing the level.\n\nBy using these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game to achieve a higher score while reaching the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> b\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> *\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> %\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b\nrow=11, col=0 -> b\nrow=11, col=1 -> b\nrow=11, col=2 -> b\nrow=11, col=3 -> b\nrow=11, col=4 -> b\nrow=11, col=5 -> b\nrow=11, col=6 -> b\nrow=11, col=7 -> b\nrow=11, col=8 -> b\nrow=11, col=9 -> b\nrow=11, col=10 -> b\nrow=11, col=11 -> b\nrow=11, col=12 -> b\nrow=11, col=13 -> b\nrow=11, col=14 -> b",
