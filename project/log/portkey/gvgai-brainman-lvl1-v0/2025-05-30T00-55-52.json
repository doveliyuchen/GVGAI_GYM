Players navigate through a grid-like level, solving spatial challenges and interacting with various sprites to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:** The game includes several types of sprites:\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character.\n   - **Wall, Floor, and Exit:** Immoveable and define the boundaries and goals of the level.\n   - **Gems (green, red, blue):** Collectibles that provide points but have different values.\n   - **Keys and Doors:** Keys allow access to different parts of the level or unlock exits; doors block passage unless interacted with properly.\n   - **Boulders:** These can bounce the avatar back and may have a role in solving puzzles.\n   \n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar interacts with keys, walls, boulders, and gems, leading to various outcomes such as score changes, transformation into different sprites, or teleportation.\n   - Collecting keys is essential to unlocking doors and endpoints.\n   - Encountering damaging gems (green, blue, red) results in the avatar's defeat, impacting the score.\n   - The goal is to find the exit after navigating through obstacles and enemies.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to reach the exit while navigating through walls, collecting gems for points, and avoiding damage from hostile gems. Successfully acquiring keys is essential for unlocking the doors that may hinder or redirect the player's path.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when the avatar reaches the exit, resulting in a score change of +10.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated (when it encounters specific destructive gems), resulting in a SpriteCounter count of 0 for the avatar, indicating game over.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Prioritize Survival:** Avoid touching the colored gems unless you can manage the risk (for example, encountering blue and red gems that lead to instant defeat).\n\n2. **Navigate Wisely:** Move through the level methodically. Since walls stop progress, plan each move carefully to avoid dead ends and traps.\n\n3. **Collect Keys:** Focus on collecting the key sprites as soon as possible. They are crucial in opening doors to new sections of the level.\n\n4. **Score Maximization:** If you need extra points, examine the value of each gem; while some are tempting, their danger may outweigh the benefits. Attempt to gather gems before proceeding toward the exit but keep an eye on health.\n\n5. **Boulder Utilization:** Use boulders for strategic movement. They might allow avoidance of obstacles or assist in clearing paths.\n\n6. **Backtrack If Necessary:** Make use of the undo mechanisms available if you find yourself stuck or losing progress due to engaging in a lethal interaction.\n\nBy balancing score collection with careful navigation and key acquisition, you'll be better positioned to reach the exit before the SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> w\nrow=1, col=2 -> a\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> b\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> *\nrow=4, col=13 -> %\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b\nrow=11, col=0 -> b\nrow=11, col=1 -> b\nrow=11, col=2 -> b\nrow=11, col=3 -> b\nrow=11, col=4 -> b\nrow=11, col=5 -> b\nrow=11, col=6 -> b\nrow=11, col=7 -> b\nrow=11, col=8 -> b\nrow=11, col=9 -> b\nrow=11, col=10 -> b\nrow=11, col=11 -> b\nrow=11, col=12 -> b\nrow=11, col=13 -> b\nrow=11, col=14 -> b",
