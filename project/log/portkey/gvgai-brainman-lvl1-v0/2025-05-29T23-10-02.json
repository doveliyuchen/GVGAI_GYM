    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules and interactions you provided, it appears that the game falls under the \u201cpuzzle\u201d genre, with elements of exploration and strategy. Here\u2019s a breakdown of its components:\n\n### Game Genre\n- **Puzzle/Strategy:** Players must strategically navigate through the level, considering the interactions between the various sprites to achieve their objectives.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites/Objects:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character, which can move around the level.\n   - **Gems:** These objects (green, red, blue) are hazardous \u2013 touching them results in losing the game.\n   - **Keys and Doors:** Keys can transform and are crucial to unlocking doors that can lead to different areas.\n   - **Boulders and Walls:** These are obstacles that affect the movement of the avatar and other objects.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with keys and doors to either gain them or cause an exit.\n   - Colliding with boulders can bounce the avatar back, while colliding with walls will push the avatar back.\n   - Collecting keys and using them appropriately is key to success.\n   - Various interactions can lead to score changes which seems to be a measure of performance in the game.\n\n### Objective\n- The main objective is to reach the exit sprite while avoiding other sprites that can \"kill\" the avatar and cause it to lose the game.\n- The player also collects points by navigating through the level safely.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they manage to reach the exit sprite without losing their avatar (i.e., the number of avatars reaches 0, resulting in a loss).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if all avatars are eliminated before reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Navigation:**\n   - Before moving the avatar, analyze the layout to identify safe paths to collect keys while avoiding harmful gems.\n\n2. **Utilize Keys Wisely:**\n   - Convert keys appropriately and understand their importance in unlocking doors.\n   - Avoid unnecessary risks when engaging with keys and doors.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Stay away from the gems unless you are confident that you can navigate around them. Managing spatial relationships between the avatar and dangerous sprites is vital to survival.\n\n4. **Use Boulders to Your Advantage:**\n   - Use boulders to bounce off when needed, but be mindful of their positioning and how they could impact your movement.\n\n5. **Prioritize Exit Over Points:**\n   - While scoring is important, focus primarily on reaching the exit sprite to secure a win, especially if points bring potential risks.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can effectively navigate the puzzles laid out in the game, avoid pitfalls, and work towards successfully reaching the exit while maximizing their score where possible.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nkey floor -> 'k'\ndoor floor -> 'd'\nexit floor -> 'e'\ngreen floor -> 'g'\nred floor -> 'r'\nblue floor -> 'b'\nboulder floor -> 'O'\nfloor -> '.'\nblue -> '@'\ndoor -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreen -> '%'\nkey -> '&'\nred -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\nkeym -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> b\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> b\nrow=1, col=8 -> b\nrow=1, col=9 -> b\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> b\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> b\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> b\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> b\nrow=3, col=8 -> b\nrow=3, col=9 -> b\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> b\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> b\nrow=6, col=5 -> b\nrow=6, col=6 -> b\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> a\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> b\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> b\nrow=7, col=5 -> b\nrow=7, col=6 -> b\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> b\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> b\nrow=8, col=8 -> b\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> b\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> b\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> %\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=14 -> b\nrow=11, col=0 -> b\nrow=11, col=1 -> b\nrow=11, col=2 -> b\nrow=11, col=3 -> b\nrow=11, col=4 -> b\nrow=11, col=5 -> b\nrow=11, col=6 -> b\nrow=11, col=7 -> b\nrow=11, col=8 -> b\nrow=11, col=9 -> b\nrow=11, col=10 -> b\nrow=11, col=11 -> b\nrow=11, col=12 -> b\nrow=11, col=13 -> b\nrow=11, col=14 -> b",
