Players typically control an avatar, navigating a level filled with interactive elements and obstacles, while solving puzzles to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprite Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with switches to change its color, affecting its movement abilities and possible interactions (e.g., bouncing off boxes or undoing previous actions).\n   - There are boxes that can interact with the avatar and other sprites, causing various outcomes like bouncing forward or undoing actions based on the avatar's color.\n   - The avatar can die by falling into \"holes\" or can reach the exit to earn points.\n\n2. **Environment:**\n   - The level consists of walls, floors, boxes, switches, holes, and an exit.\n   - Some elements are immovable, while others are passive mechanisms (like boxes) that can change behavior based on the avatar's color.\n\n3. **Transformational Mechanics:**\n   - The avatar can change colors by interacting with different switches, which may unlock new interactions and pathways within the level.\n\n#### Objective:\n- The main objective is for the avatar to reach the exit while navigating the terrain, solving puzzles involving the switches and boxes, and avoiding pitfalls (like holes).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the exit; this will also increase the player's score.\n- **Loss Conditions:** \n  - The game is lost if the avatar \"dies\" (falls into a hole), if time runs out (timeout), or if the avatar is removed from the game without reaching the exit.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Observe the Layout:**\n   - Analyze the level structure before making moves. Pay attention to the positioning of holes, walls, and boxes to plan your path.\n\n2. **Switch Interactions:**\n   - Utilize the different switches strategically. Changing the avatar's color can unlock new interactions with other sprites. Experiment with these transformations to solve puzzles effectively.\n\n3. **Box Management:**\n   - Use the boxes to your advantage. Pay attention to the types of boxes and their interactive behaviors with the various colored avatars. Focus on bouncing in the correct direction to progress.\n\n4. **Avoid Death:** \n   - Be cautious when navigating near holes. Make sure to evaluate risks before jumping or moving towards areas that could result in losing the avatar.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the time limit. Ensure that each action you take is efficient toward reaching the exit. Don\u2019t spend too long attempting to figure out a solution if a simpler path exists.\n\n6. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Given the puzzle nature, some trial and error might be necessary to understand the interactions fully. Use deaths (if they occur) to learn from mistakes and try different strategies without losing too much progress.\n\nBy understanding the rules, mechanics, and dynamics of the game, players can navigate the challenges and successfully reach the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreenSwitch -> '%'\ngreenbox -> '&'\nhole -> '*'\nnormalAvatar -> 'b'\nredSwitch -> 'e'\nredbox -> 'g'\nwall -> 'h'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'r'\nredAvatar -> 'w'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'f'\nblueAvatar -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> g\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> g\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> g\nrow=3, col=16 -> g\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> g\nrow=4, col=14 -> g\nrow=4, col=15 -> &\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> g\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> h\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> w\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> g\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> g\nrow=8, col=6 -> g\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> #\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> #\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",
