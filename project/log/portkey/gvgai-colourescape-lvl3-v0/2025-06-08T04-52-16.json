Players need to mentally map the consequences of their movements due to the undo features of various box interactions.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the exit sprite, which grants the player points and concludes the level.\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar can become nullified (losing ability to act) or score penalties if it interacts with holes. The game also has a timer, and running out of time results in a loss.\n  \n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand Interactions**: Pay close attention to how different avatars resonate with various boxes. Knowing which boxes propel your avatar forward or cause setbacks will be crucial in navigating through the level.\n\n2. **Plan Box Usage**: Strategically use boxes to propel your avatar toward the exit while avoiding combinations that could cause the undo effect. Be aware of the various colored boxes and maintain the appropriate avatar color to ensure favorable interactions.\n\n3. **Transform Wisely**: Use the switch colors intelligently to transform your avatar when necessary, especially if you encounter barriers that require a specific avatar to get past certain areas.\n\n4. **Avoid Holes**: Keep a cautious approach to the environment, particularly the holes, as they cause instant penalties. It can help to create mental checkpoints regarding their locations relative to other interacting sprites.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Plan your movements efficiently to ensure you can reach the exit before your time runs out.\n\n6. **Trial and Adapt**: As this is a puzzle-type level, consider trial-and-error techniques to evaluate possible paths and strategies, learning from mistakes and adapting your approach until success is achieved.\n\nWith careful planning and strategic interaction with game elements, players can successfully navigate through the challenges the game presents.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreenSwitch -> '%'\ngreenbox -> '&'\nhole -> '*'\nnormalAvatar -> 'b'\nredSwitch -> 'e'\nredbox -> 'g'\nwall -> 'h'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'r'\nblueAvatar -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> g\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> g\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> g\nrow=3, col=16 -> g\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> g\nrow=4, col=14 -> g\nrow=4, col=15 -> &\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> g\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> h\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> #\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> g\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> g\nrow=8, col=6 -> g\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> #\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",
