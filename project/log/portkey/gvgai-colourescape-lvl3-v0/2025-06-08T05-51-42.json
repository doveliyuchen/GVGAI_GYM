It incorporates elements of spatial reasoning and manipulation of objects to navigate to the exit while avoiding traps.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** \n  - The game contains several types of sprites including different colored boxes, switches, the avatar, walls, and exits.\n  - Boxes can manipulate the avatar's position based on interactions influenced by their colors.\n  - Switches transform the avatar into different colors, affecting gameplay mechanics and interactions that are based on color.\n  \n- **Interactions:** \n  - The avatar can collide and interact with various elements. Movement can result in bouncing forward, transformation, or undoing previous actions.\n  - Certain interactions yield negative consequences, such as falling into holes, which leads to losing points, or failing the game entirely if the avatar is lost.\n  \n- **Termination Conditions:** \n  - The game can end in three ways: winning (when the avatar reaches the exit), losing due to an empty avatar stock, or timing out.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level to reach the exit while using boxes and switches cleverly. The player must avoid holes that lead to point loss and carefully plan movements to utilize the interactions effectively.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win:** Successfully reach the exit while managing to keep the avatar alive.\n- **Loss:** Losing all avatars (game over) or the timer running out.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understanding Interactions:** \n   - Familiarize yourself with how the different colored boxes and switches interact with the avatar. This insight is crucial for planning your movements and transformations for optimal use of your resources.\n\n2. **Plan Your Path:** \n   - Study the level layout carefully to identify the best route towards the exit. Avoid unnecessary movements that could lead to falling into holes or being transformed into less advantageous avatars.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely:** \n   - Utilize boxes to bounce the avatar forward and create meaningful advancement toward the exit. Remember to avoid collisions that undo your actions if you are controlling anything other than the normal avatar.\n\n4. **Manage the Avatar Colors:** \n   - Transform strategically using switches. Sometimes being a different color can unlock specific pathways or interactions with boxes effectively, allowing you to clear certain obstacles.\n\n5. **Watch the Timer:** \n   - Keep an eye on the timer; act quickly but thoughtfully. Prioritize reaching the exit over exploring every option to avoid running out of time.\n\n6. **Avoid Pitfalls:** \n   - Be cautious about holes in the level that can result in the loss of an avatar or a point. Plan your jumps and movements to avoid inadvertently falling into these.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players can maneuver through challenges efficiently to reach the goal while mitigating risks associated with the game mechanics.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreenSwitch -> '%'\ngreenbox -> '&'\nhole -> '*'\nnormalAvatar -> 'b'\nredSwitch -> 'e'\nredbox -> 'g'\nwall -> 'h'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'r'\nblueAvatar -> 'w'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'f'\nredAvatar -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> g\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> g\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> g\nrow=3, col=16 -> g\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> g\nrow=4, col=14 -> g\nrow=4, col=15 -> &\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> g\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> #\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> h\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> g\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> g\nrow=8, col=6 -> g\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> i\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",
