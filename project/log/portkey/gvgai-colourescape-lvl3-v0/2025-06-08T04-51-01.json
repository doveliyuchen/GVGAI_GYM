Players must solve puzzles and navigate through a level while maneuvering an avatar, interacting with various objects, and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game contains multiple sprites, including the avatar, various colored boxes, switches, a hole (hazard), and an exit door.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with walls by stepping back.\n   - The avatar can transform into different colored versions by stepping on colored switches, which likely correspond to specific gameplay mechanics.\n   - Boxes (green, red, blue, normal) can cause different interactions based on the avatar's color.\n   - Certain interactions with boxes and the avatar can lead to either advancing/pushing forward or undoing actions depending on the combinations used.\n   - The player loses a point if they fall into a hole and gain a point when reaching the exit.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate through the level using the avatar to reach the exit door while avoiding hazards (holes) and managing the different colored boxes strategically. Success requires manipulating the environment (boxes and switches) to clear a path to the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Direct interaction with the exit results in a win.\n  - The exit sprite count reaches zero when the avatar successfully navigates through.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar can reach a limit of zero, implying player characters can be eliminated.\n  - If the player takes too long (timeout limit of 1500), they also lose.\n  - Entering the hole results in a loss of score and possibly a loss of the game.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Path**: Before moving, analyze the layout of the level and establish a potential path to the exit. Identify how to interact with boxes and switches to clear obstacles.\n2. **Use Horizontal Movement**: The bouncing mechanism caused by boxes can be used to strategically move away from obstacles. Ensure to utilize these to progress further.\n3. **Manage Your Colors**: As you step on switches, keep track of what each colored avatar can do in relation to the boxes around you. Use transformations wisely to avoid undoing actions unnecessarily.\n4. **Avoid Holes**: Steer clear of the holes as entering them will kill your avatar and potentially lead to losing points.\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time limit and ensure that you are making efficient progress toward the exit without exceeding the timeout.\n6. **Trial and Error**: Don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with different combinations of box interactions and switch activation to discover novel ways to interact with the environment effectively.\n7. **Adaptation**: Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on the interactions that occur, especially considering the potential to undo actions based on the box and avatar color combinations.\n\nBy applying these strategies and carefully navigating through the challenges presented in the level, players should be equipped to achieve the objectives successfully and aim for a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreenSwitch -> '%'\ngreenbox -> '&'\nhole -> '*'\nnormalAvatar -> 'b'\nredSwitch -> 'e'\nredbox -> 'g'\nwall -> 'h'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'r'\nredAvatar -> 'w'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'f'\nblueAvatar -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> g\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> g\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> g\nrow=3, col=16 -> g\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> g\nrow=4, col=14 -> g\nrow=4, col=15 -> &\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> g\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> #\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> h\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> g\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> g\nrow=8, col=6 -> g\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> w\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",

Since there are several boxes (`g`, `&`, `#`) and switches available in the vicinity, interactions need to be carefully strategized.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- The avatar should ideally make its way towards the exit at **row 1, col 3** while avoiding holes at **row 2, col 3** and interacting correctly with the colored boxes to gain access.\n- It looks like we may need to step on switches to change box colors if necessary.\n\n### Next Action\nGiven that there are numerous box obstacles in the way, a good initial action is **ACTION_RIGHT** to begin maneuvering the avatar towards the rightward area, potentially closer to managing encounters with boxes and moving towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to progress towards the exit while aligning with the overall strategy of navigating and managing box interactions efficiently. I expect to see the avatar move rightwards and progress the gameplay towards achieving the objective.",
