It has mechanics typical of games that involve movement, switches, and transforming characters.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** The game contains various types of sprites, which include players (avatars), obstacles (walls and holes), movable/reactive elements (boxes and switches), and the exit point.\n- **Movement:** The player\u2019s avatar can move and interact with specific sprites to either progress forward or encounter different effects based on the type of boxes they hit.\n- **Transformations:** The avatar can change colors/forms (normal, red, blue, green) based on which switch is interacted with. This likely alters how the player interacts with other boxes or elements in the game.\n- **Interactivity:** Many associations between avatar and other sprites dictate what happens when they come into contact, with bouncing forward, undoing actions, or losing lives.\n\n### Objectives\nThe player\u2019s primary aim is to navigate through the level to reach the exit while managing interactions with boxes and switches:\n- **Collect Score Points:** Reaching the exit increases the score, while various actions might decrease it (e.g., falling into the hole).\n- **Avoid Obstacles:** The player must avoid holes which kill the avatar and lead to score loss. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they successfully reach the exit (increased score and the exit sprite is removed).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends unfavorably if the player's avatar is killed (score becomes zero) or if the time limit is reached without reaching the exit.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Path:** Before making moves, analyze the layout for potential paths to the exit. Check the positions of holes, walls, and where boxes are located relative to switches.\n  \n2. **Switch Wisely:** Utilize the different switches to transform the avatar into the appropriate type (based on the color) to interact effectively with corresponding boxes. Transforming at the right time can help in navigating obstacles better.\n\n3. **Risk Management:** Be cautious around holes. Ensure that you bounce off boxes at safe angles where returning to the hole is not a risk. Aim to learn the bounce behaviors with each box type.\n  \n4. **Timing Matters:** With a time limit of 1500, balance your exploration and speed. Don\u2019t rush if it jeopardizes your position or leads you towards a loss condition (like falling into a hole).\n  \n5. **Undoing Actions Safely:** If forced into a situation where reaching the exit is impossible, look for ways to undo interactions with boxes to create a better opportunity to continue progressing.\n\n6. **Exploit the Environment:** Always look for open paths and analyze potential interactions with boxes that can propel you closer to your goal, especially in complex levels with numerous obstacles. \n\nUnderstanding these rules and mechanics will give players a good foundation for succeeding in this puzzle/platformer game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nnormalAvatar floor -> 'A'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nbluebox floor -> '2'\nredbox floor -> '3'\ngreenbox floor -> '4'\nblueSwitch floor -> 'b'\nredSwitch floor -> 'c'\ngreenSwitch floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nblueSwitch -> '@'\nbluebox -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\ngreenSwitch -> '%'\ngreenbox -> '&'\nhole -> '*'\nnormalAvatar -> 'b'\nredSwitch -> 'e'\nredbox -> 'g'\nwall -> 'h'\nredAvatar redSwitch -> 'r'\nredAvatar -> 'w'\nblueAvatar blueSwitch -> 'f'\nblueAvatar -> 'i'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> h\nrow=0, col=1 -> h\nrow=0, col=2 -> h\nrow=0, col=3 -> h\nrow=0, col=4 -> h\nrow=0, col=5 -> h\nrow=0, col=6 -> h\nrow=0, col=7 -> h\nrow=0, col=8 -> h\nrow=0, col=9 -> h\nrow=0, col=10 -> h\nrow=0, col=11 -> h\nrow=0, col=12 -> h\nrow=0, col=13 -> h\nrow=0, col=14 -> h\nrow=0, col=15 -> h\nrow=0, col=16 -> h\nrow=0, col=17 -> h\nrow=1, col=0 -> h\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> g\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> h\nrow=1, col=10 -> e\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> h\nrow=2, col=0 -> h\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> *\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> g\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> h\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> &\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> h\nrow=3, col=0 -> h\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> &\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> &\nrow=3, col=15 -> g\nrow=3, col=16 -> g\nrow=3, col=17 -> h\nrow=4, col=0 -> h\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> @\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> &\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> h\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> g\nrow=4, col=14 -> g\nrow=4, col=15 -> &\nrow=4, col=16 -> #\nrow=4, col=17 -> h\nrow=5, col=0 -> h\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> *\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> &\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> g\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> #\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> h\nrow=6, col=0 -> h\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> h\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> h\nrow=7, col=0 -> h\nrow=7, col=1 -> %\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> *\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> h\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> h\nrow=8, col=0 -> h\nrow=8, col=1 -> g\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> g\nrow=8, col=6 -> g\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> &\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> #\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> &\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> h\nrow=9, col=0 -> h\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> *\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> #\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> w\nrow=9, col=17 -> h\nrow=10, col=0 -> h\nrow=10, col=1 -> h\nrow=10, col=2 -> h\nrow=10, col=3 -> h\nrow=10, col=4 -> h\nrow=10, col=5 -> h\nrow=10, col=6 -> h\nrow=10, col=7 -> h\nrow=10, col=8 -> h\nrow=10, col=9 -> h\nrow=10, col=10 -> h\nrow=10, col=11 -> h\nrow=10, col=12 -> h\nrow=10, col=13 -> h\nrow=10, col=14 -> h\nrow=10, col=15 -> h\nrow=10, col=16 -> h\nrow=10, col=17 -> h",

    "content": "To begin, I will analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map.\n\n### Current Analysis\nThe avatar is currently represented as 'w' (redAvatar) at position (9, 15). The exit is located at (1, 3) represented by '$'. The nearby elements are predominantly walls ('h') and the floor ('.'), along with boxes ('g', '#', '&', etc.), some switches ('@', '%', 'e').\n\n### Observations:\n1. The direct path to the exit is blocked by walls and holes.\n2. There are various box types around, including red boxes and green boxes, but the avatar needs to gain access to the appropriate switches to navigate through.\n3. The closest switch to interact with is at row 7, column 1, which is '%'. This may allow interactions with green boxes nearby.\n\n### Strategy Direction\nFollowing the overall strategy:\n- **Plan the path:** The best course of action seems to lead towards the nearby switch to interact with green boxes. \n- **Switch wisely**: If I can make it to the switch, I can then position the avatar to interact with surrounding boxes.\n\n### Potential Actions:\nSince the avatar is currently in position (9, 15), the immediate next move will be to check if I can move to (8, 15) toward the switch at (7, 1) as a next actionable step.\n\n**Action plan:**\n1. Move **UP** to approach the interaction point with the switch.\n\n``` \nAction:4 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThe action is **UP** to (8, 15) - This is the first step towards reaching the green switch which may be crucial for solving the puzzle and allowing further movement towards the exit. I expect to be able to evaluate my next steps based on this movement.",
