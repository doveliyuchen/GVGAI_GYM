    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOverall, this is a puzzle game in the spirit of classic Sokoban-style challenges. You control an avatar (a knight) that moves around a grid-based level filled with walls, floors, holes, and boxes. The primary objective is to get rid of all of the regular boxes, which is achieved when there are zero boxes remaining on the level.\n\nKey Mechanics:\n1. Movement & Obstacles:\n\u2003\u2022 The avatar moves around a grid but cannot pass through walls (contact with a wall causes a step back).\n\u2003\u2022 There are other passive objects and obstacles (like bbox) that interact with the avatar and other elements, ensuring movement is challenging and moves must be calculated.\n\n2. Box Manipulation:\n\u2003\u2022 Boxes (represented by the sprite \u201cbox\u201d) can be pushed around by the avatar.\n\u2003\u2022 When a box is moved onto a hole (the \u201chole\u201d sprite), it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d and the player scores +1. This transformation is the goal, as transformed boxes (boxin) appear to count as \u201cremoved\u201d in the win condition.\n\u2003\u2022 However, if a \u201cboxin\u201d touches the ground (the \u201cground\u201d sprite), it reverts back into a regular box with a score penalty of \u20131. This means that you must be careful not to accidentally dislodge a correctly placed box.\n\n3. Puzzle Dynamics:\n\u2003\u2022 The level layout is concrete with walls, open areas, and holes placed in specific positions.\n\u2003\u2022 You must navigate the level, pushing boxes into holes and ensuring that once a box is correctly deposited (transformed into boxin), it stays there.\n\nWin/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 The win condition is met when there are no regular boxes remaining on the level (SpriteCounter for \u201cbox\u201d reaches zero). \n\u2003\u2022 Losing is likely related to making moves that prevent you from getting all boxes into holes (for example, accidentally pushing a boxin off a hole, or getting blocked by walls), though the rules only explicitly mention the win condition.\n\nOverall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Your Moves: Study the layout and determine which boxes can be moved safely into holes. Think a few moves ahead to avoid situations where you accidentally push a transformed box (boxin) off a hole.\n\u2003\u2022 Secure Deposits: When you push a box into a hole (thus transforming it into a boxin), be cautious with subsequent moves. Avoid moving in ways that could nudge them back onto the ground, as this loses your progress.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the Environment: Understand the placement of walls and the limited spaces available. Work slowly to avoid unintended collisions and \u201cundoAll\u201d interactions that could reset your progress.\n\u2003\u2022 Maintain Control: Often puzzle games like this will offer ways to undo erroneous moves (as suggested by rules like \u201cbbox wall bbox > undoAll\u201d), so make use of that feature if available to experiment with different strategies without permanent consequences.\n\nIn summary, the game is a grid-based puzzle where precision and forethought are key. Focus on pushing boxes into holes carefully, secure them so they don\u2019t revert, and use the structure of the level to your advantage to eventually clear all boxes and win the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $",
