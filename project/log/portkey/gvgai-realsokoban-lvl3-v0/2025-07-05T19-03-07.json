It involves moving an avatar within a constrained environment, interacting with various objects to achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features several types of sprites (objects), including:\n  - **Immovable** sprites (walls, floor, ground, hole) that form the boundaries and environment.\n  - **MovingAvatar** (the player character, marked as 'A') which can navigate through the level.\n  - **Passive** sprites such as 'bbox' which seem to interact with the avatar and walls.\n  - **Transformable** sprites like 'box' and 'boxin' which change states based on interactions.\n  \n- **Interactions**: The player can:\n  - Step back when colliding with a wall.\n  - Interact with the passive sprite ('bbox'), causing it to bounce back (this may help in navigating the puzzle).\n  - Transform a 'box' into a 'boxin' when it falls into a hole, gaining points.\n  - Transform 'boxin' back into a 'box' when placed on the ground, losing points.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reduce the number of 'box' sprites to zero. Achieving this triggers a win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the sprite counter for 'box' reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: While a loss condition is not explicitly outlined, the game's mechanics imply a potential for deadlock or inability to progress if moves are exhausted without achieving the goal.\n\n### Level Layout Interpretation\nThe level is structured as follows (with 'A' as the avatar, 'w' as walls, '.' as empty spaces, 'o' as holes, and '*' representing where 'box' and 'boxin' can potentially be):\n```\nwwwwww\nwo..ww\nwA**.w\nww...w\nwww..w\nwwwwow\nwwwwww\n```\nThe main tasks will be:\n1. Navigate the avatar between walls, holes, and blocks.\n2. Use holes strategically to transform boxes (gaining points and reducing the total count of 'box').\n \n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Environment**: Initially move around to understand the layout and locate all available holes and boxes.\n2. **Use Holes Wisely**: Always prioritize placing 'box' sprites into holes to convert them to 'boxin', thus reducing the count of 'box' and gaining points.\n3. **Watch for Backtracking**: If a collision occurs with a wall, step back and reassess your strategy to avoid getting stuck.\n4. **Reduce Boxes Efficiently**: Aim for the highest score with minimal movements; always look for opportunities to place boxes in the holes rather than returning them to the ground.\n5. **Plan Ahead**: Analyzing how interactions can alter positions and states of sprites will help in optimizing movements toward your objective.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can efficiently navigate the level to achieve their goal while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $",

In this configuration, two actions are possible regarding the boxes:\n1. Move the box at (2, 4) to the right into a hole, however there is no hole nearby.\n2. Move the box at (3, 2) down into (4, 2), but again there is no hole directly reachable from there.\n\n### Planned Action:\nGiven that the immediate objective is to progress by eliminating the boxes, I should first check if I can interact with any box efficiently.\n\n**Action: Move Left**\nMoving left from (2, 2) to (2, 1) will give me a better perspective on potential boxes to interact with and check for advancement toward a hole without causing any blockage by walls.\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\n\nThis action aligns well with the strategy to explore my environment further to check for opportunities to eliminate 'box' sprites.",
