When a box is pushed onto a hole, it \u201ctransforms\u201d into a different state (\u201cboxin\u201d) and you score a point. The game is won when there are no more \u201cbox\u201d sprites left\u2014that is, all boxes have been correctly placed.\n\n\u2022 Basic Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 The avatar can move around the level but is blocked by walls (\u201cw\u201d). When hitting a wall, the avatar steps back.\n\u2003\u2013 When you push a box, you have to be mindful: a box that gets pushed into a hole changes state (becoming \u201cboxin\u201d), which is good. However, if a \u201cboxin\u201d later touches a ground tile (the normal floor), it transforms back into a regular box and you lose the bonus points.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s also an undo mechanic tied to complex collisions (\u201cbbox wall bbox > undoAll\u201d), which hints that if you make a wrong move (like pushing two boxes against a wall), the game can quickly reverse several actions.\n\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Win: You win when all boxes have been successfully pushed into holes (so the count of \u201cbox\u201d sprites reaches zero). This means you must keep the boxes securely in place so they don\u2019t revert back to their movable state.\n\u2003\u2013 Loss: While there isn\u2019t an explicit \u201closs\u201d condition described, making mistakes (like dislodging a placed box or misusing moves that trigger the undo) can prevent you from completing the puzzle efficiently.\n\n\u2022 Strategy Tips:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan Your Moves Carefully: Just like in Sokoban, think ahead about where each box needs to go. Consider if there\u2019s enough room to maneuver without accidentally pushing a box out of its correct position.\n\u2003\u2013 Secure Box Placements: When a box touches a hole, it transforms to \u201cboxin\u201d and you gain points. Try to keep these \u201cboxin\u201d sprites undisturbed on the holes, as any accidental move can revert them back to boxes (and lose some points).\n\u2003\u2013 Use the Level Layout: The level layout shows walls around the edges and a few holes scattered inside. Use the walls strategically to help you push boxes slowly into the holes without overshooting.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid Collisions That Trigger Undo: Be cautious with moves that might cause complex collisions (like a box being pushed into another box against a wall) because these trigger an \u201cundoAll\u201d reaction that could set you back.\n\nIn summary, the game tests your ability to plan several moves ahead while managing the delicate state changes of the boxes. The challenge is to maneuver your knight precisely to guide all boxes into the holes without accidentally dislodging them, which requires both strategy and careful movement.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> a\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $",
