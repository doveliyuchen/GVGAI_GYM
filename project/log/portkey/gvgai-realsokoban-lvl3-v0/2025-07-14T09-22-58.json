You control a knight-like avatar that moves around a grid and must manipulate boxes to achieve the goal.\n\n\u2022 Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Movement and Collisions: You control an avatar that can push boxes around. When you bump into walls, the game forces you back (\u201cstepBack\u201d on hitting a wall), while interactions between boxes (or bbox) and the avatar can \u201cbounceForward\u201d the avatar.\n\u2003\u2013 Box Transformations: There are two states for the boxes. When a box is pushed onto a hole, it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d and you gain a point. However, if this transformed box then touches a ground tile, it reverts back to a regular box and you lose a point. This dance means you have to be cautious about how you move boxes around.\n\u2003\u2013 Undo Mechanic: There\u2019s a rule where if a moving auxiliary object (\u201cbbox\u201d) collides with a wall in a particular way (bbox colliding with a wall and another bbox), the game undoes all recent moves. This suggests that some moves can lead to unwanted setups, and you might have to rely on the undo to try again.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The main objective is to clear all the boxes from the board (the win condition is reached when the sprite count for \u201cbox\u201d is 0). Essentially, you need to transform each box correctly so that they no longer count as a \u201cbox.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 You win when you\u2019ve successfully gotten rid of all boxes according to this rule.\n\u2003\u2013 Losing might occur if you get stuck in a situation where the boxes are not in the correct transformation state, or if you trigger the undo mechanism repeatedly\u2014suggesting you\u2019ve made a series of moves that lead to a dead end.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan Your Moves: Think ahead about where you\u2019re pushing each box. The key is to maneuver them into holes so they transform into \u201cboxin\u201d (which then no longer count as a \u201cbox\u201d) and avoid accidentally rolling them back onto the ground.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid Reversals: Since moving a \u201cboxin\u201d tile back onto ground will convert it back into a regular box (and subtract from your score), you want to keep the box safely in the hole. This may require keeping your avatar in position to block unintended moves.\n\u2003\u2013 Use the Environment: Walls and immovable objects can help guide the boxes in the correct direction. Use them to limit the box\u2019s movement so that once a box reaches a hole, it doesn\u2019t get pushed out accidentally.\n\u2003\u2013 Manage Undo Triggers: Be mindful of the \u201cbounce\u201d and \u201cundoAll\u201d interactions. Sometimes an apparently good push might lead to an overall negative setup if it causes a chain reaction. If needed, take advantage of the undo (whether manually or as a result of a move) to reset the board and try a different strategy.\n\u2003\u2013 Incremental Progress: Focus on clearing boxes one by one or in small groups, ensuring that each move leaves the board in a state where the next box can be handled without disrupting your previous work.\n\nIn summary, your task is to carefully push boxes into holes, avoid letting them slide back onto the ground, and leverage the level\u2019s walls and obstacles to keep everything in control. With careful planning and strategic movement, you can transform every box and win the puzzle!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $",
