    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a puzzle platformer. The blend of movable sprites (like the avatar and box), immovable sprites (like walls and ground), and interaction mechanics suggests a focus on navigation and problem-solving.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Boxes**: Movable obstacles that can be pushed into holes for points. They can also be transformed into a different state (boxin) which affects the score.\n   - **Wall**: Solid obstacles the avatar cannot pass through.\n   - **Holes**: Specific places where boxes can be placed to score points.\n   - **Floor/Ground**: The base on which the avatar and boxes interact.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can bounce back when colliding with walls.\n   - The avatar can push boxes into holes, transforming them and increasing the score.\n   - Boxes can revert if placed incorrectly (indicated by the undo mechanics).\n   - The interaction between boxin and ground can decrease score, indicating a strategic element in play.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe main objective is to manipulate boxes so that they are placed into holes, transforming them into the boxin type and accumulating points. Ultimately, the goal is to have all boxes removed (transformed into boxin) to win the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the count of the box sprite reaches zero, indicating that all boxes have been successfully transformed into boxin and perhaps placed into holes. \n- **Loss Condition**: The game does not specify a loss condition based on the described rules, suggesting the primary goal is achieving the win condition instead.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Assess Initial Configuration**: Begin by surveying the level layout and noting where the boxes and holes are positioned. \n\n2. **Plan Movements**: Consider the sequence of moves that are necessary. Prioritize pushing boxes into holes efficiently while accounting for walls; the avatar cannot walk through walls, so plan pushes around obstacles.\n\n3. **Manage Score Changes**: Be careful with the transitions between box and boxin, as they affect your score. Aim to maximize transformations for the highest score and minimize negative impacts (transforming boxin back into box).\n\n4. **Avoid Undo Situations**: Be cautious when moving boxes around walls. If two boxes collide against a wall, it can undo previous actions, counteracting your progress.\n\n5. **Progress Gradually**: As boxes are pushed into holes, reevaluate the board's state frequently. Adapt your strategy based on the current setup of boxes and their positions.\n\nBy methodically working through the puzzle mechanics and maintaining a clear focus on the win condition, players will be able to advance successfully through the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $",

The most strategic action would be to push the box at (3, 2) directly left into the space and then aim for the hole at (1, 1).\n\n2. **Plan Initial Movement**: The avatar can navigate left, and since the box at (3, 2) can be pushed, moving the avatar left is a logical step to facilitate this.\n\nGiven the instructions and the state, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action will move the avatar to the left, and I expect the box at (3, 2) can subsequently be pushed up into the hole.",
