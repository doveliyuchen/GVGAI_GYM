    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle Game, Sokoban-like\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player (avatar) can move around the level.\n*   **Pushing:**  The avatar can likely push 'box' sprites.\n*   **Obstacles:** Walls block the avatar's movement.  'bbox' sprites seem to function as bumpers.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    *   Boxes ('box') that are pushed into holes ('hole') become 'boxin' and the player gets a point.\n    *   'boxin' that are pushed onto 'ground' transform back into 'box' and the player loses a point.\n*   **Bouncing:** 'bbox' sprites bounce the avatar back. Three 'bbox' and a wall causes an undo, likely resetting to the last position.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The main objective is to get rid of all 'box' sprites.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** You win when the number of 'box' sprites remaining reaches 0.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   'w' represents 'wall' sprites.\n*   'o' represents 'hole' sprites.\n*   '.' represents 'ground' sprites.\n*   'A' represents the starting position of the 'avatar'.\n*   '\\*' represents the starting position of the 'box' sprites.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Holes:**  Locate all 'hole' sprites. These are your targets.\n2.  **Plan Box Movement:**  Carefully plan the route to push each 'box' into a 'hole'. Since each 'boxin' on the ground will need to be returned to its 'box' state, consider carefully whether each box can be inserted into its holes.\n3.  **Avoid Traps:** Be mindful of walls as they can create dead ends. Try to think several moves ahead.\n4.  **Use 'bbox' bumpers strategically:** Use bbox sprites to reverse or redirect your avatar.\n\nIn essence, this looks like a variant of Sokoban where you must strategically push boxes into holes, but pushing filled boxes back onto the ground reverts them to regular boxes. The puzzle likely lies in the limited space and the consequences of incorrectly placing a 'boxin'.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> a\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> @\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> $\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> $",
