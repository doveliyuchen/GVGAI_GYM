Players must navigate through a level using various mechanics to solve puzzles and reach an objective.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n- **Sprites**: The game utilizes various sprites that represent different objects and entities, such as the player (avatar), walls, boxes, keys, locks, and exits.\n- **Interactions**: Different interactions between the avatar and other sprites dictate the game's mechanics:\n  - The player can collect keys and shovels.\n  - The avatar can interact with locks (which can kill the player if certain conditions aren't met).\n  - The player can create protective smoke, which serves as a shield against destructive elements (death).\n  - The player can manipulate boxes and walls, which may affect movement and puzzle-solving.\n- **Spawn Points**: Certain sprites like \"smokespawn\" can generate additional sprites (in this case, smokes), affecting game strategy.\n  \n**Objective**: The main goal is for the avatar (player) to navigate through the level and reach the exit (denoted by the sprite 'exit'). The player must interact with various objects, such as boxes and keys, to successfully open the exit and earn points.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Winning**: The player wins if they interact with the exit sprite, which incrementally increases the score.\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is killed by a death sprite or if there are no remaining avatars present.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Exploration**:\n   - Begin by carefully exploring the environment. Take note of all key locations, box placements, and walls.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - Collect the key and shovel as soon as possible. The key is a limited resource and is crucial for opening locks.\n   - Ensure to manage your collected items wisely to prevent accumulating unnecessary deaths or blockages.\n\n3. **Puzzles**:\n   - Focus on puzzles involving the locks and boxes. You often need to move boxes to access other areas or manipulate the environment for progression.\n   - Remember that using a box on a smokespawn sprite can also clear them, which can aid in navigating the area.\n\n4. **Use of Smoke**:\n   - Utilize the smoke for protection against the death sprite. Proper timing and placement are key to avoiding fatalities.\n   - The smoke can act as a shield, so position yourself strategically when encountering threats.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route**:\n   - Before making any moves, plan your route to the exit to maximize efficiency and minimize risk. Avoid backtracking, as clashes with walls can hinder progress.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Be prepared to fail and learn from mistakes. Each interaction with the environment and sprites provides clues for better strategies in subsequent attempts.\n\nBy balancing exploration, resource management, and tactical maneuvering, players will greatly increase their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox death
