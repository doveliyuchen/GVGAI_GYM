    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**1. Game Genre:**\nThis game appears to be a puzzle-platformer with elements of adventure. Players must navigate through a level filled with obstacles, interact with objects, and collect resources to progress.\n\n**2. Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various sprites represent different elements in the game, such as walls, keys, boxes, and the player avatar.\n- **Collision and Interaction:** The avatar can move, collect resources (like keys), and interact with various objects (like walls and locks). \n- **Spawn Points:** Smoke spawns are scattered throughout the level, which can shield the player from a death sprite but also transform.\n- **Resource Management:** The player must collect a limited number of keys to access certain areas (locks) and manage their usage effectively.\n  \n**3. Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the exit sprite while avoiding death by interacting with the various game elements. Players need to find keys to unlock locks and may encounter boxes that can be used to earn a score.\n\n**4. Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the exit sprite (door), resulting in a score increment.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is killed by the 'death' sprite or exceeds the limit of resources (for example, attempting to interact with a lock when they have no keys).\n\n**5. Overall Strategy:**\n- **Resource Management:** Carefully manage the keys and watch out for locks. Players should avoid using their key on a lock if they have a potential conflicting option.\n  \n- **Utilizing Smoke:** Use smoke to shield yourself from the 'death' sprite when navigating dangerous areas. Since smoke can transform, understanding the timing of its cooldowns is crucial.\n  \n- **Plan Your Route:** Before making moves, assess the layout properly. Identify paths that allow access to keys and the exit while minimizing encounters with the 'death' sprite and locks.\n\n- **Avoid Wall Interactions:** Be cautious around walls, as stepping back can hinder progress. Plan moves to ensure you're not unintentionally obstructing your path.\n\n- **Score Management:** Consider the interaction with boxes and the potential bonuses they give. Engaging with boxes should be strategic and timed to maximize score increases while ensuring other objectives aren't compromised.\n\n### Summary:\nIn this puzzle-platformer, players must deftly navigate a maze, collect keys, avoid death, and plan movements strategically to reach the exit. Optimal use of resources, awareness of the environment, and careful interaction with sprites are key to success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox death ground -> '@'\ndeath -> '#'\ndeath ground -> '$'\ndeath smoke smokespawn -> '%'\nexit ground -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\ndeath smokespawn -> 'b'\ndeath smoke -> 'd'\nshovel wall -> 'e'\n\n=== Current State

The goal is to reach the exit (denoted by '&') located at (11, 24).\n\nAnalyzing the surrounding area in relation to our avatar's current position:\n- To the left (3, 16) is a 'b' (death smoke).\n- To the right (3, 18) is '%' (death smoke).\n- Below (4, 17) is '*' (wall).\n- Above (2, 17) is '%' (death smoke).\n\nFrom our position, movement in any direction either results in a wall or a dangerous sprite. The current strategy involves navigating carefully through the maze while avoiding interactions that can lead to loss (death or resource management issues). Since the avatar did not move in the previous attempt to act, we must analyze our next appropriate action.\n\nConsidering these directions:\n- Moving left or right leads to a 'b' or '%' which are dangerous.\n- Moving down is blocked by a wall.\n- Moving up to (2, 17) would put us back into a 'death smoke'. \n\nGiven that all immediate moves seem dangerous or blocked, it appears that the only safe action is to manage our current position. \n\nSince the last action did not result in any movement, I'll choose to rotate the direction towards down.
