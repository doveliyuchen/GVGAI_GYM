The presence of moveable objects (like boxes), a player avatar that interacts with the environment, and the objective of navigating through a level to reach an exit indicates elements typical of this genre.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n1. **Movement and Interaction**:\n   - The avatar can move around and interact with walls, ground, and various objects (like boxes, keys, and locks).\n   - The avatar can step back when hitting walls, which indicates a need for careful navigation.\n\n2. **Collecting Resources**:\n   - The key and shovel are resources that the avatar can collect and utilize throughout the game.\n   - A singleton key implies that there can only be one key held at a time.\n\n3. **Transformations and States**:\n   - The smokespawn transforms into smoke at spawn points and interacts dynamically with other objects.\n   - The avatar can gain a protective shield from smoke, indicating a layer of strategy in managing resources to ensure survival.\n\n4. **Win Conditions**:\n   - The exit is key to winning, and the avatar must reach the exit without being killed or losing resources.\n   - It\u2019s also possible to gain score by defeating boxes, which provides extra motivation to engage with certain elements of the environment.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game appears to be to reach the exit ('e') while navigating past obstacles and managing interactions with various objects to successfully collect the key and possibly other resources to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: You win if the avatar reaches the exit. \n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar loses if it is killed by other sprites (e.g., the death sprite).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Focus on collecting the key early since it is required to unlock specific areas (the lock). Keep an eye on maintaining the key when it is necessary to evade locks that require more than one key.\n\n2. **Exploration and Navigation**:\n   - Explore the level thoroughly to find and defeat boxes since they can yield score bonuses and help you clear a better path.\n   - Pay close attention to walls, as they will push you back if you try to pass through them, affecting your movement strategy.\n\n3. **Utilize Smoke Wisely**:\n   - Use the smoke effectively as a shield against potential death sprites. Position yourself to utilize smoke zones strategically to avoid/mitigate damage.\n   - Be aware of smoke spawn points and when they produce smoke, as they can provide temporary protection.\n\n4. **Prioritize Exits**:\n   - Always aim towards reaching the exit as soon as it becomes reachable. Make inventory management decisions based on whether you'll need further resources to complete the game while keeping an eye on potential threats.\n\n5. **Calculate Risks**:\n   - Determine the best times to engage enemies (like boxes for scores) versus moving to safety areas or towards the exit. Each interaction could mean the difference between winning or losing.\n\nBy understanding the game's mechanics and employed strategies effectively, players can navigate through challenges posed by the layout and obstacles, moving towards completion of each level with a good score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox death
