    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n**Game Analysis**\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be an *action-adventure* or *arcade-style survival game*. It involves movement, interactions with various sprites, and a continuous challenge to avoid damage while pursuing an objective.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including the player's avatar (spaceship), movable and immovable objects, a bomb, planets, and hazards like blackholes.\n  \n- **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that moves at a speed of 0.5. The player has a health system, with a maximum health of 20.\n  \n- **Obstacles and Hazards**: The player must avoid nebulae and bombs, which can cause health loss and may kill the avatar on contact.\n  \n- **Planets**: Players can gather health points by interacting with planets (transforming empty planets to busy ones) and they can gain additional time when interacting with the atmosphere.\n  \n- **Blackholes**: These are passive sprites that will kill the avatar but also increase the score if the avatar interacts with them.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to survive for a specified timeout (1000 units of time) while either avoiding or strategically interacting with various sprites. The player wins if the number of blackholes touching the avatar reaches 0, otherwise, if the avatar's health drops to 0, they lose. The score can be affected by interactions with blackholes and potentially negative interactions with bombs and nebulae.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - Survive until the timeout, ensuring that the count of active blackholes is at 0.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The avatar's health points drop to 0.\n  - Timeout runs out with more than 0 blackholes remaining.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Movement and Positioning**: Keep the avatar moving to avoid both bombs and nebulae. Utilize slower movement to navigate through tight spaces and avoid rushing into hazards.\n  \n2. **Health Management**: Focus on interacting with planets to increase health points. Prioritize avoiding damage while trying to keep health above critical levels (the lower the health, the more cautious you should be).\n\n3. **Utilizing Blackholes**: While they are dangerous, interacting with blackholes can yield a score boost. Consider positioning your avatar to minimize direct threats while earning those points.\n\n4. **Timer Resources**: Look for interactions with the atmosphere to increase your timer. This will extend your playtime and provide more opportunities to gather health and points.\n\n5. **Avoiding Bombs**: Be aware of bomb locations and their attraction mechanics. Monitor sprites around you and always have an escape route planned when interacting with an area with bombs.\n\nBy following this holistic strategy of movement, health management, and strategic interactions, you\u2019ll be better positioned to survive the game\u2019s challenges and ultimately win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

However, since I do not have the current position of my avatar or any details about the surrounding sprites and hazards, I'm unable to identify my exact situation.\n\nAssuming that my avatar has not moved recently and needs to re-evaluate the current obstacles (potentially bombs, nebulae, or blackholes), my best strategy at this point is to take a cautious move in a direction away from any potential threats. \n\nGiven that my position is crucial, I will choose an action that allows me to assess the surrounding environment better, specifically through movement. My goal is to either avoid hazards or interact with planets or the atmosphere.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to move left and see if there are any potential threats or opportunities for health and survival, aligning with the overall strategy of monitoring my surroundings while keeping my avatar safe.",
