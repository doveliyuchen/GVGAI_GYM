Players control an avatar (spaceship) navigating through a defined area (space), interacting with various objects, and avoiding hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game involves various sprites including avatars, bombs, planets, a nebula, turrets, and black holes, each with distinct functions:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character with health points and the ability to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Nebula**: A hazard that subtracts health points from the avatar.\n   - **Bombs**: Can damage the avatar and also attract the avatar\u2019s attention, indicating they are a significant threat.\n   - **Planets**: Safe zones where the avatar can gain health.\n   - **Black Hole**: A lethal hazard that kills the avatar but grants scoring.\n   - **Turrets**: Static enemies that periodically launch bombs towards the avatar.\n\n2. **Health System**: The avatar starts with a health point limit of 20 and can gain health by interacting with planets.\n\n3. **Interactions**: The game has multiple interactions defined which determine the outcomes when the avatar contacts other sprites:\n   - Health reduction on contact with hazards (nebula, bombs, black holes).\n   - Health gain on contact with planets.\n   - Transformation of empty planets into busy planets upon the avatar's arrival.\n\n4. **Win/Loss Conditions**: \n   - The game is lost if the avatar's health reaches zero or if the timer expires (1000 units).\n   - The game is won if there are no black holes left and the avatar stays alive.\n\n#### Overall Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the environment while managing health and avoiding damage from hazards like the nebula and bombs. The player aims to eliminate black holes to secure victory.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Health Management**: Focus on navigating towards planets (safe zones) frequently to restore health. Avoid battles unless necessary, as engaging with enemies (turrets) and hazards can quickly deplete health.\n\n2. **Obstacle Navigation**: Identify the locations of bombs and black holes, and plot a route that minimizes contact with these hazards. Use the spaces between turrets effectively.\n\n3. **Resource Gathering**: Switch empty planets to busy planets whenever possible to create safe zones, while keeping an eye on any incoming threats.\n\n4. **Timing**: Since bombs have a cooldown, maintain distance and time the movements to avoid their attacks. When able, attack areas with multiple black holes to eliminate them more efficiently.\n\n5. **Awareness of Surroundings**: Always maintain a broader view of your surroundings given the dynamic threat of turrets and the close proximity of black holes. React quickly to threats while aiming to maximize health regeneration opportunities.\n\nBy employing these strategies, the player can enhance survival time and work towards effectively eliminating the black holes to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

From my previous understanding of the game's mechanics and my friend's strategy, I need to prioritize movement towards safe zones (planets) and avoid hazards (nebula, bombs, black holes) while also managing my health.\n\nGiven that my avatar's position is crucial, if it has not changed from the last state, a new action must be taken to reposition away from threats or toward safety.\n\nSince I do not have the specific position and layout from the current state, I will make a proactive move in a safe direction while also considering that I may need a rotation first if that was the previous action.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should help me navigate left, and I expect to either find a safe zone or avoid hazards as I continue to strategize my approach to eliminate black holes effectively.",
