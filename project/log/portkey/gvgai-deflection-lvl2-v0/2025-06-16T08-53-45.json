It features an avatar navigating through a hazardous environment, avoiding enemies (bombs), and interacting with various game objects ( planets, nebula, etc.).\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Movement**:\n   - The player controls an avatar that can move at a fixed speed.\n   - The game contains various sprites, including static elements (background, nebula), passive elements (planets, blackhole), and dynamic entities (bullets).\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar interacts with multiple objects which can either harm (bombs, nebula, blackhole) or benefit (planets, atmosphere) the player.\n   - It can convert empty planets into busy ones, effectively managing resources.\n   - The avatar can restore health points by landing on planets.\n\n3. **Health and Damage**:\n   - The avatar has a health system where it loses health points by coming into contact with harmful sprites, while certain sprites (planets) restore health points.\n   - The avatar can die if health points hit zero or by an encounter with certain dangerous sprites.\n\n### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to survive by managing health and navigating the environment while converting empty planets to busy planets.\n- Players also need to eliminate or manage the blackholes for victory conditions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The player wins if the number of blackhole sprites reduces to zero.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player loses if the avatar sprite is reduced to zero.\n  - Additionally, if the timer reaches a limit of 1000 without achieving the win condition, the game ends in loss.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Damage**:\n   - Prioritize avoiding enemy projectiles (bombs) and dangerous sprites (nebula, blackholes). Utilize the environment to stay clear of these threats.\n\n2. **Health Management**:\n   - Regularly move to planets to regain health points, especially when low on health. Monitor health closely to avoid sudden death from enemy encounters.\n\n3. **Planets Usage**:\n   - Convert as many empty planets to busy planets as possible. This could provide strategic advantages and possibly additional benefits.\n\n4. **Navigating the Level**:\n   - Explore the level to map out the locations of safe zones (empty planets) and hazardous zones (bombs, nebula, blackhole).\n   - Pay attention to the layout and find routes that minimize contact with danger while maximizing health recovery.\n\n5. **Time Awareness**:\n   - Keep an eye on the timer, as failure to win within the time limit results in a loss. Efficiently identify blackholes to eliminate in a timely manner.\n\n### Conclusion\nStrategically navigating through the game involves balancing health restoration with the avoidance of hazards. By understanding the dynamics of each sprite and interacting optimally with the environment, players can achieve their objectives while ensuring their survival against various threats.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

If you could provide that information, I would be able to analyze the state properly, determine the best action, and ensure alignment with the strategy laid out.",
