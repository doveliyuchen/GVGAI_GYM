    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre:**  \nThe game appears to belong to the **action-adventure** or **strategy** genre, with elements of exploration, survival, and resource management.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Different sprites represent various game elements, including the player-controlled avatar (spaceship), passive objects (blackhole, planets), and enemies (bombs and turrets).\n- **Health System:** The avatar has health points, which can be reduced by collision with bombs or harm from the nebula.\n- **Transformation:** The avatar can convert empty planets into busy planets, potentially suggesting a resource-gathering mechanic.\n- **Time & Events Influence:** The atmosphere sprite has a timer interacting with the busy and empty planets, which may introduce time-based strategy.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to survive while managing health and navigating the environment to transform empty planets and ultimately ensure that the blackhole (a potential threat) does not eliminate the avatar.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - The game is won if the number of blackholes (represented by the SpriteCounter limit) reaches zero.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero, if the avatar is killed by blackholes, or if the game times out after a set period (1000 units of time).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Health Management:**  \n   - Prioritize avoiding bombs and the nebula, as they will reduce your health. Keeping your health points above zero is crucial for survival.\n\n2. **Planet Transformation:**  \n   - Focus on transforming empty planets into busy ones to possibly gain advantages or resources. Aligning with these planets should be a tactical move while ensuring you are safe from enemy sprites.\n\n3. **Navigation and Avoidance:**  \n   - Maneuver carefully through the environment to avoid turret attacks and bomb sprites. Utilize the speed of your avatar (0.5) to navigate strategically.\n\n4. **Utilizing the Atmosphere:**  \n   - Take advantage of the atmosphere's timer function to manipulate the state of planets, possibly regenerating health or creating temporary safe zones.\n\n5. **Score Management via Blackholes:**  \n   - The game seems to reward you through score changes when blackholes are involved, indicating a potential for using them strategically against other sprites.\n\n6. **Time Management:**  \n   - Keep an eye on the timer, as the game will end after 1000 time units. Balance your actions to optimize exploration and conversion of resources within this timeframe.\n\n7. **Avoid Confined Spaces:**  \n   - When the play area starts feeling congested (especially near busy planets and turrets), retreat to gain clarity or regain health points before proceeding.\n\nBy combining survival techniques with strategic resource management, players can navigate this game effectively while aiming for a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To choose the optimal action based on the provided game analysis, I need to consider my current position and the surrounding environment. Since you mentioned that my avatar position is crucial, I will first assess whether the last action taken resulted in a change of position.\n\nIf the position has not changed from the last state (indicating a potential rotation), I will determine the next best step based on the established strategy which focuses on health management, resource conversion, avoidance of hazards, and timely action.\n\nGiven this context, I will begin by taking a directional action. Let's say I will attempt to move left, which might allow me to navigate away from potential threats and position myself toward empty planets for conversion. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to reposition my avatar strategically, in line with the focus on survival while also potentially facilitating the conversion of nearby empty planets.",
