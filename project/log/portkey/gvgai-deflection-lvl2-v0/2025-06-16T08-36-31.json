Use avoidance tactics to escape their effects, as both can lead to loss of health or immediate death.\n3. **Planet Management**: Actively work to transform empty planets into busy planets\u2014this could provide resources and health benefits as indicated in the interactions.\n4. **Utilize the Atmosphere**: Look for the atmosphere sprite to transform planets effectively into busy ones, thereby ensuring that you have a steady supply of health points.\n5. **Timing and Movement**: Since the avatar has a speed of 0.5 and interacts with bombs having a movement speed of 0.9, strategic positioning and timing when moving around the map are crucial to minimizing damage and maximizing health resources.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can effectively navigate the map, manage their health, and work towards defeating the black hole, ultimately increasing their chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "I will begin by analyzing the current state, particularly focusing on the avatar's position, the nearby elements (planets, black hole, bombs, etc.), and my health points. This information will guide my next action based on the strategic recommendations provided.\n\nSince I don't have the exact current state details, my first action will be to check my surroundings by choosing a directional action that could allow me to navigate effectively. To do this, I'll first attempt to move LEFT, as it might provide a different perspective and possible interactions with nearby elements.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThe expectation is that this move will either bring me closer to beneficial resources or help avoid immediate threats, following the strategy of health management and hazard avoidance.",
