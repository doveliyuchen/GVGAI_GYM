    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here\u2019s an analysis covering the game genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a **2D action-adventure game** or a **survival game**, possibly blended with elements of **strategy**. The presence of avatars, health points, and interactions with various sprites suggests a focus on player navigation and resource management.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: \n  - **Avatar**: The player's character with specific health points and speed.\n  - **Turrets**: Automated defense mechanisms that can attack the player by dropping bombs.\n  - **Nebula and Blackholes**: Hazardous elements that can harm the player.\n  - **Planets**: Various types that can either heal the avatar or be transformed from empty to busy.\n  \n- **Health and Movement**: \n  - The avatar must manage its health and avoid threats like bombs and blackholes.\n  - The avatar can gain health by interacting with planets and has a speed attribute that influences movement.\n\n- **Transformations and Timers**: \n  - Interaction with different planetary types (empty and busy) can change their state, which may impact strategy concerning resource (health) maintenance.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to **survive while navigating through the environment** and managing health points. The avatar must interact with elements like planets for health and avoid hazards like blackholes and bombs. Additionally, ultimately, the player aims to eliminate all blackholes to win.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: The player wins by eliminating all instances of the blackhole sprite.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar sprite count reaches zero (implying the avatar has been destroyed).\n  - The game times out after a set number of moves (1000).\n  \n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**:\n   - Prioritize interacting with planets to restore health. Always keep a close watch on your health points, especially after encountering hazards.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards**:\n   - Be strategically aware of the positions of blackholes and turrets, and plan routes to avoid them as much as possible. Use slow movement strategically to navigate without getting hit.\n\n3. **Utilize Safe Zones**:\n   - Make use of empty planets. Transform them into busy planets for possible resource benefits while ensuring safe distances from immediate threats.\n\n4. **Plan Efficient Moves**:\n   - Carefully calculate your moves to avoid bomb sprites, especially with their random placement and potential interactions. Timing your movement can help avoid damage during high-risk turns.\n\n5. **Timer Awareness**:\n   - Pay attention to the time limit and make sure to take necessary actions within the game\u2019s constraints to avoid dying from a timeout.\n\n6. **Map Familiarization**:\n   - Familiarize yourself with the overall layout of levels to plan your trajectory and find safe routes while actively working on your win objective of clearing blackholes.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, players can enhance their chances of survival and ultimately achieve their goal of defeating the blackholes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To effectively strategize, it's vital to analyze the current state of the game, including the position of hazards and available resources. Since the objective is to survive while eliminating blackholes, locating both your avatar and these hazards allows for informed decision-making.\n\nGiven that successfully managing health is key, interaction with planets will be important. If my avatar remains static, I'll need to determine if the last action led to a rotation without movement, prompting a need to reassess and take a directional action again.\n\nTo proceed, I need to take meaningful action based on my current position. If I find myself at risk of an attack from a turret or approaching a blackhole, I should choose an evasive action rather than one that would keep me stationary or in danger.\n\nNow I will proceed to make a directional action that aligns with avoiding hazards and potentially interacting with resource-giving planets. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this action to provide a safe movement to the left, potentially away from nearby threats while positioning myself better for the next turn.",
