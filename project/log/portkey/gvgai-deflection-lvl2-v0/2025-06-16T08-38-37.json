    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, layout, and interactions, here are the key concepts and analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy.\n\n### Genre\nThis game appears to belong to the action-adventure genre with elements of strategy and puzzle-solving. The player controls an avatar (spaceship) as they navigate a 2D map filled with various obstacles and interactive elements, which could suggest a blend of exploration and combat mechanics.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as the player\u2019s avatar, nebula (damaging element), bombs (projectile hazards), planets (health sources), and a blackhole (game-ending hazard). \n2. **Avatar Control**: The player's avatar has limited movement speed and health points, suggesting that careful navigation and sparing use of resources is important.\n3. **Interactions**: Different interactions can happen:\n   - Taking damage from nebulas and bombs reduces health.\n   - Aligning with and transforming from empty to busy planets can replenish the avatar's health.\n   - The presence of blackholes introduces an instant threat, leading to a loss condition.\n4. **Health Management**: The avatar can gain health by interacting with planets, but can also lose health through multiple sources like bombs and nebulas.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to survive and reach a state where the blackholes are eliminated (count reaches zero), all while managing health and navigating potential hazards in the environment. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: You win the game when the count of blackhole sprites drops to zero.\n- **Loss Conditions**: You lose the game if your avatar's health drops to zero or if the time limit of 1000 expires before achieving your objectives.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Health Management**: Focus on transforming empty planets into busy ones to gain health points, keeping the avatar's health as high as possible to withstand damage from various sources.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Navigate carefully to avoid collision with nebulae and bombs, which can detriment your health and lead to potential loss.\n3. **Utilize Blackholes**: If blackholes grant points and can be manipulated, consider any strategies to manage their interactions to your advantage before they pose a danger.\n4. **Explore the Map**: Take time to explore and interact with the environment strategically; assessing where to find busy planets can be crucial for conserving health.\n5. **Plan Movements**: Given the avatar's speed and limited health, plan routes that minimize exposure to damaging hazards while securing health replenishing opportunities when needed.\n\nThese strategies will enhance the player's chances of winning while navigating the game's threats effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To determine the next action, I will need to understand the current state, particularly the position of my avatar in relation to the hazards (nebulae, bombs, and blackholes) and the health sources (busy planets). Since the objective is to decrease the blackhole count without losing health, I must strategize my movement accordingly.\n\nIf my avatar hasn\u2019t moved from the last state, I should consider whether the previous action resulted in the avatar rotating but not moving. If that\u2019s the case, I should take a different action to hopefully move towards a busy planet for health or away from hazards.\n\nGiven that I lack the current positioning and hazards layout, I\u2019ll assume my last action was a movement attempt that left my position unchanged and move in a direction that could logically lead to either avoiding damage or gaining health.\n\nLet's proceed with an action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action indicates I am going to move left. I expect that this direction may lead me towards a safer area or possibly a health source, aligning with the strategy of health management and hazard avoidance.",
