    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, we can analyze the game as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **top-down action-adventure** or **space survival game** where the player controls an avatar (a spaceship) with various interactions and objectives set in an abstract space-themed environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features multiple sprites including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character (spaceship) that can move around the area.\n   - **Nebula**: A damaging sprite that decreases the player's health.\n   - **Blackhole**: A deadly sprite that kills the avatar upon contact but can provide score points if avoided.\n   - **Turret**: An enemy that randomly fires bombs at the player.\n   - **Planets**: Can either be empty or busy, with interactions that restore health or transform states.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can lose health when colliding with certain objects like the nebula or bombs.\n   - Interacting with empty planets transforms them into busy planets, potentially changing game dynamics.\n   - The avatar can gain health by interacting with planets or avoid blackholes for bonus points.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends when the avatar is destroyed (health points drop to zero), when all blackholes are defeated, or upon timeout.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding dangers (nebulae, bombs, blackholes) while interacting with planets to gain health and potentially win by defeating all blackholes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions**: \n  - Successfully eliminate all blackholes from the level.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player's avatar is destroyed (health points decrease to zero).\n  - Timeout occurs (the game ends after a specified time limit).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\nTo maximize your chances of winning, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: \n   - Steer clear of nebulae and bombs as they will drain your health. Use the slower speed to navigate carefully.\n\n2. **Manage Health**: \n   - Regularly check your health points and prioritize interacting with empty planets to transform them and restore health.\n\n3. **Utilize Blackholes**: \n   - While dangerous, blackholes can offer score points for evasion. Focus on avoiding them until you are strong enough to confront them.\n\n4. **Plan Movement**: \n   - Create a route around the map that allows you to interact with planets and evade turrets and bombs efficiently.\n\n5. **React Quickly**: \n   - The turret generates random bombs; be alert and anticipate their firing to dodge effectively.\n\n6. **Balance Risk and Reward**: \n   - While health restoration is crucial, engaging with blackholes and other sprites should be calculated to avoid unnecessary loss.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy implementing the above strategies in conjunction with an understanding of the game mechanics and objectives, players can increase their chances of surviving and ultimately winning the game. Analyzing the level layout can further enhance tactical movement around the map.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To proceed effectively, I need to analyze my current state. Since my avatar's position is critical to my movements, I will observe if it has changed from the last state. If it hasn't, I'll re-evaluate my options based on both the environment and the available actions.\n\nGiven that I also need to keep in mind the hazards like nebulae, blackholes, and bombs, I will first look for an optimal direction to rotate or move that allows me to avoid those hazards while also gaining access to empty planets for health restoration.\n\nSince I have not been given explicit information about the current position and layout of sprites, I will strategically consider moving left or right if it seems to be the best course of action based on available information.\n\nFor now, assuming that there are no imminent threats directly to the left and right of my avatar, I will attempt to rotate left in preparation for a further maneuver.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action aims to allow me to potentially move into a safer zone and align myself with strategic points on the map for future moves. I'm hoping to reposition or discover empty planets by doing so.",
