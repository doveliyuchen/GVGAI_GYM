Players navigate through a grid-like environment, solve challenges, and use various interactive elements (like bombs, fire, and lasers) to progress towards a goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites** are the various entities in the game. Key sprites include:\n  - **Environment**: Ground, water, mud, walls, boxes.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character with health points.\n  - **Weapons and Hazards**: Bombs, lasers, fires, which can affect the environment and the avatar.\n- **Interactions** dictate how the avatar, bombs, and other entities can affect each other and the environment. For example:\n  - The avatar can't pass through walls or water and can be killed by water or fire.\n  - Bombs can be used to alter other sprites, such as creating sparks or transforming fire into mud.\n- The game features a **goal** (a green door) that the avatar must reach to win.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to maneuver the avatar to reach the **goal** sprite (the green door). Players must avoid losing all their health points and must navigate the environment strategically to achieve this.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar successfully reaches the goal sprite, resulting in the elimination of the goal sprite from play.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar's health points drop to zero (Sprite counter for the avatar reaches 0).\n  - A timeout occurs after 1000 turns, which indicates the player has run out of time to reach the goal.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Assess the environment**: Before making moves, analyze the grid layout to understand where walls, boxes, and hazards are located.\n  \n2. **Careful Movement**: Move the avatar cautiously to avoid water and fire hazards. Always plan where to step next, considering the possible interactions with bombs and fire.\n\n3. **Use Bombs Wisely**: Use bombs to create paths or clear obstacles. Remember that they can transform certain sprites into harmful ones (like sparks) if placed incorrectly.\n\n4. **Manage Health**: Keep an eye on the avatar's health. Avoid unnecessary interactions with fire or water, which can damage your avatar.\n\n5. **Create Sparks**: If possible, create sparks from bombs interacting with the environment. Sparks can be beneficial for clearing paths or dealing with hazards indirectly.\n\n6. **Plan for Time**: Be mindful of the turn limit. Don't make unnecessary moves, and try to find the shortest path to the goal.\n\nBy combining careful navigation with strategic use of the environmental elements and interactions, players can effectively work towards winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcleft lleft -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlleft water -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> &\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=17 -> $\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> @\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> a\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

There are obstacles (boxes) in the immediate vicinity, and the straight path toward the goal is blocked by both boxes and hazards.\n\n### Potential Action Evaluation\n1. The immediate surrounding vertical and horizontal spaces around our avatar are:\n   - LEFT (8, 2): clean space (not useful for immediate movement)\n   - RIGHT (8, 4): clean space\n   - UP (7, 3): clean space\n   - DOWN (9, 3): clean space\n\nWe should first move the avatar to navigate around the boxes: moving up (to 7, 3) seems to be an optimal choice as it allows for future movement toward the goal area, moving above where the boxes are currently positioned.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\nI expect this action to be strategically beneficial as it positions us closer to potential pathways leading toward the goal, while avoiding immediate hazards.",
