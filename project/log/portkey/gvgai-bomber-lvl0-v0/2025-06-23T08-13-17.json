The significance of spatial interactions suggests a logical or strategic component typical in puzzle games.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites including immovable obstacles (ground, water, mud, walls, boxes), interactive elements (lasers, bombs, and fires), and an avatar that players control.\n- **Interactions**: Players interact with the environment and elements:\n  - The avatar can be harmed (by water and fire) or transformed (by bombs).\n  - The bomb can interact with other sprites, creating sparks or killing sprites when involved with specific elements like fire or walls.\n  - Certain interactions can manipulate the environment, such as turning water into mud or destroying boxes or walls.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the \"goal,\" represented as a green door. This can be achieved by bringing your avatar (player character) to the goal without running out of health points or exceeding a set time limit.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win Conditions**: The player wins by reaching the goal (door).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar's health points reach zero.\n  - The time runs out (timeout limit of 1000).\n  - The avatar cannot be spawned anymore (if the avatar sprite count reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify safe paths and obstacles to navigate effectively towards the goal.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Keep an eye on your health points. Avoid water and fire, which can harm your avatar. Utilize bombs carefully to trigger transformations that create safe paths or destroy obstacles.\n\n3. **Utilize Bombs Wisely**: Place bombs in strategic locations to eliminate blocks or create sparks that can interact with fire and water. Remember that bombs can convert to bombm (missile), which has different interactions.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Always be aware of cells that may cause damage or lead to fail conditions. Stay away from areas where there's a high concentration of fire or water.\n\n5. **Timing**: Monitor the timer; make calculated moves rather than rushing. Plan your route to the goal while considering potential transformations needing to occur through bomb use.\n\n6. **Experimentation**: The game seems to allow for interactions to reshape the environment. Try experimenting with bombs amidst obstacles to discover new pathways or clear the way.\n\nThis combination of strategic movement, resource management, and an understanding of object interactions can help players effectively navigate challenges toward achieving the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcleft lleft -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlleft water -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> &\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> &\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> &\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=17 -> $\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> @\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> a\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

There are obstacles and various interactive elements present on the grid.\n\nLooking at the vertical column where the avatar currently resides, the cells above are primarily occupied by water ('.'), with an immediate danger at (1, 2) - (1, 6), which are all water cells, creating a risk for the avatar.\n\nConsidering the strategy provided, the next logical step is to move towards the goal while keeping safe from hazards. The immediate surrounding cells do not present attack options towards the goal (1, 1) effectively from (8, 3). Thus, a suitable action would be to move **UP** the grid to explore new positions while avoiding any immediate harm.\n\nThus, I will execute: \n``` Action:5 ```\nThis action is expected to help attempt a path upward towards the goal while avoiding hazards. I will observe how this move changes my situation on the grid.",
