The player interacts with various sprites, such as obstacles, enemies, and objects that can be manipulated to achieve objectives.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:** \n   - The game features various types of sprites, including walls, goals (doors), water, fire, bombs, and lasers. Each sprite has specific interactions that affect gameplay. For example:\n     - The avatar must avoid water, as it will result in death.\n     - Bombs can be interacted with to create sparks or transform into other objects.\n     - Fire can negatively impact the avatar's health and can also spread, affecting other objects.\n   - The avatar can only move through certain areas, with walls and boxes blocking the path but can step back if it collides with them.\n\n2. **Player Actions:**\n   - The player moves the avatar around the grid-based level and uses the environment to their advantage. They can place bombs to manipulate sprites strategically.\n\n3. **Health and Points:** \n   - The avatar has a health counter, and the goal involves eliminating specific targets (like boxes) for points.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The main goal is to reach the \"goal\" sprite (green door).\n- Players earn points by eliminating boxes with fire.\n- The avatar must navigate without running out of health and either reaching the goal or running out of allowed avatars.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning Conditions:\n  - Successfully reaching the goal (green door) results in victory.\n- Losing Conditions:\n  - If the avatar\u2019s health points reach zero, or if the time limit of 1000 units is exceeded, the game is lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Planning Your Route:** \n   - Before moving, observe the level layout carefully. Identify potential obstacles and path options that lead to the goal. \n\n2. **Utilization of Bombs:**\n   - Use bombs strategically to clear pathways and interact with fire and boxes. \n   - Place bombs in areas where you anticipate their explosion will cause a chain reaction, ideally getting rid of boxes or allowing access to new routes.\n\n3. **Fire Management:**\n   - Be cautious with fire; it can damage your avatar and block paths. You can manipulate fire by placing bombs nearby or using it to destroy boxes, but ensure you avoid damaging your avatar.\n\n4. **Health Preservation:**\n   - Keep track of your health and ensure you are not engaging in unnecessary risks. Avoid water and fire at all costs to preserve your health points.\n\n5. **Time Management:**\n   - Pay attention to the timeout limit. If you find yourself spending too long in one area with no progress, consider re-evaluating your approach or strategy.\n\n6. **Adapt and React:**\n   - Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on the sprites' behavior and interactions. If an approach does not seem to yield results, consider alternate routes or methods to engage with the environment.\n\nBy understanding the game's mechanics, objectives, and winning strategies, players can effectively navigate the challenges and solve the puzzles presented, ultimately leading to victory in reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nlcleft lleft -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\nlleft water -> '&'\nbomb -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=0, col=13 -> %\nrow=0, col=14 -> %\nrow=0, col=15 -> %\nrow=0, col=16 -> %\nrow=0, col=17 -> %\nrow=0, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> #\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> &\nrow=1, col=10 -> &\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> &\nrow=1, col=13 -> &\nrow=1, col=14 -> &\nrow=1, col=15 -> &\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=17 -> $\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> %\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> @\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> %\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> %\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> %\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> @\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> @\nrow=8, col=17 -> .\nrow=8, col=18 -> %\nrow=9, col=0 -> %\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> .\nrow=9, col=18 -> %\nrow=10, col=0 -> %\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> %\nrow=10, col=4 -> %\nrow=10, col=5 -> %\nrow=10, col=6 -> %\nrow=10, col=7 -> %\nrow=10, col=8 -> %\nrow=10, col=9 -> %\nrow=10, col=10 -> %\nrow=10, col=11 -> %\nrow=10, col=12 -> %\nrow=10, col=13 -> %\nrow=10, col=14 -> %\nrow=10, col=15 -> %\nrow=10, col=16 -> %\nrow=10, col=17 -> %\nrow=10, col=18 -> %",

Since the avatar's last position did not change, I will consider moving in a direction that leads towards the goal while strategically planning my route.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince moving directly up to (7, 2) would lead to an empty space and potentially allow further exploration upwards towards the goal, I will take this action.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action (moving up) will help me explore new paths toward the goal!
