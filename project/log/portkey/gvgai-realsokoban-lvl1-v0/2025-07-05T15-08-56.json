    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the rules and level layout you provided:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game (specifically, a Sokoban-style puzzle)\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing Blocks:** The core mechanic revolves around pushing boxes ('box' sprite) around the level.\n*   **Level Transformation:** Boxes can be transformed to different kind of boxes in different locations: 'box' becomes 'boxin' when pushed into a 'hole', and 'boxin' becomes 'box' when moved onto 'ground'.\n*   **Movement Restrictions:** The avatar ('avatar') can't move through walls ('wall'). Pushing boxes also contributes to movement restrictions, as the avatar can only push one box at a time.\n*   **Bouncing:** The avatar bounces off 'bbox' sprites, and 'bbox' sprites can bounce off walls and other 'bbox' sprites, leading to an undo of moves if the avatar gets stuck against a wall.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The player needs to get rid of all of the 'box' sprites on the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** The game is won when the number of 'box' sprites equals 0 (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True). There is no explicit loss condition defined, which means that the player can always restart the level.\n\n**Sprites:**\n\n*   **avatar:** The player-controlled character.\n*   **box:** A standard pushable block.\n*   **boxin:** A transformed version of the block after it enters a hole.\n*   **wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **hole:** A location where a box can be transformed into 'boxin'.\n*   **ground:** A location where a boxin can be transformed into 'box'.\n*   **bbox:** A passive sprite the avatar bounces off of, to get the avatar stuck.\n*   **floor/ground:** Decorative or structural sprites that don't directly affect gameplay.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Represents walls.\n*   `.`: Represents floor.\n*   `o`: Represents holes.\n*   `*`: Represents boxes.\n*   `A`: Represents the avatar's starting position.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban-style games require careful planning. Randomly pushing boxes will almost certainly lead to unsolvable situations.\n2.  **Avoid Corners:** Getting a box stuck in a corner is often fatal. Think about the consequences of each push.\n3.  **Prioritize Hole Placement:** Identify the boxes that are easily accessible and can be pushed into holes without blocking other boxes.\n4.  **Consider the Consequences:** Think about how transforming 'box' into 'boxin', and 'boxin' back into 'box' affects the possible win state.\n5.  **Restart When Necessary:** Don't be afraid to restart the level if you realize you've made a mistake.\n\nIn essence, the game is a puzzle where the player must strategically push boxes into holes to eliminate them from the level and achieve the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
