When a box is pushed onto a hole, it \u201ctransforms\u201d into a different kind (called boxin) and you earn a point.\n\u2003\u2013 However, if a boxin later rolls onto ground, it transforms back into an ordinary box (and you lose that extra point). This means placement matters!\n\u2003\u2013 There are physics interactions too: the avatar can bounce off other objects (like bboxes) and walls will force the avatar to step back.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s also an \u201cundoAll\u201d rule triggered by a particular sequence (involving a bbox, wall, and another bbox) that undoes some moves, so you\u2019ll want to avoid accidental collisions that cause this reversal.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The win condition is met when there are no more boxes (sprite type \u201cbox\u201d) left in play.\n\u2003\u2013 In practice, you need to use the holes to transform boxes into the alternate state (boxin) where they\u2019re \u2018removed\u2019 from the box count. In other words, the goal is to push every box into a hole so that they no longer count as boxes.\n\u2003\u2013 Losing isn\u2019t explicitly described (other than getting stuck in a situation that prevents you from achieving the win condition), so careful planning is key.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Analyze the layout: Study the maze-like level with walls and open spaces so you can figure out how to maneuver boxes safely.\n\u20032. Plan Your Moves: Instead of haphazardly pushing boxes, plan how to get them to the holes. Make sure you\u2019re not inadvertently pushing a box into a tight corner or into an area where it might trigger the undo action.\n\u20033. Use Holes to Your Advantage: Focus on maneuvering boxes onto holes. When a box collides with a hole, it transforms (gaining you a score point) and effectively counts as \u201cremoved\u201d for the win condition, as long as it doesn\u2019t later transform back on ground.\n\u20034. Avoid Unwanted Transformations: Be cautious \u2013 if a boxin touches ground, it reverts to a box, undoing your progress. So, push boxes in such a way that once they\u2019ve hit a hole, they remain stable.\n\u20035. Exploit Avatar Interactions: Use the mechanics (like bouncing forward when colliding with certain objects) to fine-tune your positioning and push boxes accurately.\n\nIn short, this is a puzzle game about carefully planning and orchestrating moves to push boxes onto holes. The trick is to manage box placements so that once a box transforms (into boxin), it stays that way\u2014ensuring that eventually all boxes are \u201cremoved\u201d from play, which is your win. Enjoy solving the spatial challenges and puzzle out the right sequence of moves!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\n$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$....$$$@..$\n$....a...$.$\n$...$###...$\n$.@@$$$$$$$$\n$$$$$$$$$$$$\n............\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\n.$$$$$$\n.$....$\n.$@...$\n.$@...$\n.$$$..$\n.$$#a$$\n.$$#.$$\n.$$#.$$\n.$$..@$\n.$$.$.$\n.$$...$\n.$$$$$$\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
