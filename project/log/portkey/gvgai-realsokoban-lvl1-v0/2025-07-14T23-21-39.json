You control an avatar (a knight sprite) that moves around a level full of walls, floors, holes, and boxes. Your main task is to maneuver the boxes into the correct position to change their state and ultimately meet the win condition.\n\nKey points of the game:\n\n\u2022 Genre & Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a puzzle game where you push boxes around a grid.\n\u2003\u2013 The avatar can move and push boxes, but hitting walls \u2013 or boxes in certain contexts \u2013 forces you to step back or bounce forward.\n\u2003\u2013 There are reactive interactions: for example, colliding with walls makes you back up, and interacting with other moving elements may trigger an \"undo\" of previous moves if things go wrong.\n\u2003\u2013 Movement and object interactions are very deliberate, meaning every move must be planned.\n\n\u2022 Objective:\n\u2003\u2013 Your goal is to remove all boxes from the level. More precisely, the win condition is met when there are no boxes (stype = box) remaining on the grid.\n\u2003\u2013 The trick is that when a box goes onto a hole, it transforms into a different state (named \"boxin\") and you earn points. However, if that transformed box then touches a ground sprite, it turns back into a box and you lose points.\n\u2003\u2013 Thus, the challenge is to place boxes into holes reliably so that they stay there and count as \u201ccompleted\u201d rather than turning back into boxes.\n\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 You win when every box has been converted (and effectively removed from the \u201cbox\u201d count) by being correctly pushed onto holes.\n\u2003\u2013 Losses or setbacks occur when a box that was already \u201csecured\u201d in a hole transforms back by contacting the ground, which not only subtracts points but may also undo your progress.\n\u2003\u2013 There are other interactions (like the undoAll command on certain collisions) that serve as penalties for messy moves.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2013 Plan your moves carefully, much like in classic Sokoban puzzles. Every slide counts!\n\u2003\u2013 Focus on guiding boxes into holes where they transform and \u201clock in\u201d your progress. Once in a hole (becoming boxin), ensure they don\u2019t wander onto ground areas where they\u2019d change back.\n\u2003\u2013 Use walls to your advantage \u2013 they block undesirable movements and can help control the box\u2019s final position.\n\u2003\u2013 Consider the order in which you move your boxes. Think ahead to avoid triggering the undoAll interaction or unwanted re-transformations.\n\u2003\u2013 As you maneuver, observe the layout carefully: narrow passages or traps can make some boxes more difficult to secure, so plan routes that avoid getting boxes stuck.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re solving a spatial puzzle that demands foresight and precision. Carefully maneuver the boxes with your avatar, make sure to keep them in their transformed state by using holes smartly, and avoid moves that force them back onto plain ground. A step-by-step, patient approach is the key to victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
