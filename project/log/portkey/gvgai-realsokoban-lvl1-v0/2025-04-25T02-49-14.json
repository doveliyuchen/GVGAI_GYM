The combination of moving avatars, immovable objects, and interactions with various sprites (blocks, walls, holes) suggests a puzzle-centric approach where the player must navigate and manipulate the environment to achieve certain objectives.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor & Ground:** Both are immovable and likely serve as the base or available area for movement.\n   - **Hole:** Serves as a target area for interaction, represented in dark blue.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character able to move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Bounding Box (bbox):** Passively interacts with the avatar and possibly acts as a tool to solve challenges.\n   - **Box & Boxin:** These represent movable blocks that players can interact with to change their types and the game state.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - **Avatar and Wall:** The avatar cannot pass through walls and must step back when encountering them.\n   - **Avatar and Bbox:** The avatar interacts with the bounding box in a way to bounce forward, indicating that they may be used to push or guide blocks.\n   - **Box and Hole:** When a box is placed in the hole, it transforms into a boxin, and the score increases by 1.\n   - **Boxin and Ground:** When a boxin is placed back onto the ground, it transforms back into a box, and the score decreases by 1.\n   - **Box Interactions with Each Other:** If two boxes collide against each other, they revert back to their original states, indicating a reset mechanism.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is to transform all boxes into boxin by strategically placing them in the corresponding holes while keeping the **SpriteCounter for boxes** at a limit of 0 to achieve a win condition.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Achieved when there are no boxes left on the field (i.e., SpriteCounter for box reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** While not explicitly stated, a loss scenario may arise from being unable to make moves (e.g., if the player becomes trapped between walls and objects).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Planning Movements:** The player should analyze the space and plan movements ahead of time to prevent getting stuck against walls or boxes. Utilize the bounding box effectively to manipulate other boxes without getting trapped.\n\n2. **Efficient Placement of Boxes:** Focus on getting boxes into holes systematically. Prioritize transforming boxes into boxin by guiding them to the holes while minimizing the return of boxin to the ground unless necessary.\n\n3. **Avoid Excessive Transformation:** Since the scoring system records the movement of boxes back to their original form as negative points, aim to transform boxes to boxin efficiently and avoid excessive bouncing back and forth.\n\n4. **Trial and Error:** Given the interactions can undo previous moves, players should be prepared to experiment with placements and moves to discover optimal strategies.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can work towards successfully navigating the puzzle and achieve the objective of the game while avoiding unnecessary complications arising from returning boxin to box form.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
