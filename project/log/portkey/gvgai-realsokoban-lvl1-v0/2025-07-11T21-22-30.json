    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Game Genre**:  \nThis game falls under the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players must navigate through levels while solving puzzles related to physics and interactions with sprites (objects in the game).\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent various game elements:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Such as walls and floors, which players cannot move through or alter.\n  - **Moving Avatar**: The player controls an avatar that can move around the level.\n  - **Passive and Active Sprites**: Certain sprites interact with the avatar and affect gameplay (e.g., boxes and holes).\n  \n- **Interactions**: Players can interact with objects in specific ways:\n  - The avatar cannot pass through walls and will step back if it collides with them.\n  - Moving a box onto a hole transforms it into a \u201cboxin,\u201d earning points.\n  - Returning a \u201cboxin\u201d to the ground transforms it back into a regular box, losing points.\n  - Boxes have a bounce mechanism against the avatar.\n  \n**Objectives**:  \nThe main objective is to manipulate boxes in a way that transforms a given number into \u201cboxin\u201d states while managing score changes. Successfully converting all boxes to \"box\" states and navigating the level to meet sprite count requirements leads to a win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win Condition**: You win the game if you transform all sprites of the type \u2018box\u2019 to zero before the limit is reached.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The gameplay does not explicitly mention a loss condition; however, failing to manipulate boxes effectively may not achieve the win condition.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before making any moves, assess the layout and think about how to position the boxes to reach the hole without getting stuck.\n  \n2. **Box Management**: Focus on getting the boxes into the holes as quickly as possible to maximize your score:\n   - Move boxes towards the holes strategically, ensuring you can maneuver around walls without getting blocked.\n  \n3. **Use Bounces Wisely**: Use the box-bounding mechanic effectively. When the avatar interacts with boxes, make sure the bounces help you position the boxes rather than sending them too far away from the hole.\n\n4. **Watch Your Score**: Keep track of your score as you convert boxes. Remember that turning a \"box\" into \"boxin\" gives you a point, but returning \u201cboxin\u201d to ground will lose you a point, so aim to keep a beneficial score.\n\n5. **Avoid Trapping Yourself**: Ensure that you do not block your own path to the holes. Plan movements that keep multiple options available for future moves.\n\nBy understanding these mechanics and strategizing effectively, players can navigate through levels successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",

The avatar can move either left or right, but since there are walls on both sides, I'll focus on moving downwards where I can push the box at (4, 2) into the hole at (3, 6).\n\nI'll perform the action to move down:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action is expected to result in moving the avatar down to (4, 3), positioning it to push one of the boxes into a hole on the next turn. I anticipate this will be a useful step towards transforming boxes into \"boxin\" states.",
