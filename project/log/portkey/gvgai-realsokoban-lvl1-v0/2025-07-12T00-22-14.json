    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's an analysis of the game based on the rules and level layout you provided:\n\n**Game Genre:** Puzzle Game (Specifically, a Sokoban Variant)\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Pushing:** The core mechanic involves pushing boxes (`box`) around the level.\n*   **Limited Movement:** The `MovingAvatar` indicates limited movement; the player can only move the avatar one space at a time.\n*   **Transformation:** Boxes change state between `box` and `boxin` based on location (`hole` and `ground`).\n*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** The avatar must avoid walls (`wall`). The `stepBack` interaction suggests that bumping into a wall causes the avatar to move back.\n*   **BBox Interaction:** The `bbox` sprite and associated interactions suggest some form of bouncing mechanic when interacting with the avatar and walls.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   The primary objective is to get all the `box` sprites into `hole` sprites and transforming them into `boxin` sprites.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n\n*   **Win:** The player wins when the number of `box` sprites remaining in the level reaches 0 (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True`). This means all boxes have been successfully pushed into holes.\n\n**Sprite Summary:**\n\n*   `avatar`: The player-controlled character.\n*   `box`: A pushable object.\n*   `boxin`: A box that has been successfully placed in a hole.\n*   `floor`, `ground`: likely visual background tiles.\n*   `hole`: The target destination for the boxes.\n*   `wall`: Impassable obstacles.\n*   `bbox`: Passive sprite likely involved in collision logic or movement restriction.\n\n**Level Layout Observations:**\n\n*   The level is small and contained.\n*   There are multiple `box` sprites indicated by `*`.\n*   There are `hole` sprites labeled `o`.\n*   The player (`A`) starts in a specific location.\n*   The walls (`w`) form a boundary and internal obstacles.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Plan Ahead:** Sokoban-style games require careful planning. Think several moves ahead to avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or blocking pathways.\n2.  **Prioritize Cornered Boxes:** Identify boxes that are in or near corners early. These are often the most difficult to maneuver and can easily lead to unsolvable situations.\n3.  **Utilize Open Space:** Use open floor space to reposition boxes strategically.\n4.  **Avoid Blocking Yourself:** Be mindful of the avatar's position and avoid trapping yourself where you cannot push the boxes effectively.\n5.  **BBox Strategy:** Given the `bbox` interactions, experiment with how the `bbox` impacts your movement and box placement. This could be a key element in solving the puzzle. It could involve bouncing the player away from walls or obstacles to create space for pushing boxes.\n\nIn short, this game is a puzzle game where the player needs to push boxes into holes. The puzzle design and the `bbox` mechanic will likely be the key challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
