It features elements where players must navigate and manipulate objects within the environment to achieve an objective.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \nThe game revolves around the interactions between different types of sprites (characters and objects). Key mechanics include:\n- Movement: The 'avatar' is a moving character controlled by the player.\n- Interactions with environment: \n  - The avatar can \"bounce back\" from walls and other objects.\n  - Boxes can be moved and transformed either into a powered-up state ('boxin') or back into their original state ('box').\n  - Boxes that fall into holes are transformed, contributing to the score.\n  \n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to manipulate the boxes in such a way that they all fall into the holes on the map, transforming them into 'boxin' and effectively reducing the total count of regular 'box' sprites in play. Specifically, the goal is to achieve a situation where there are no 'box' sprites remaining on the board (SpriteCounter limit=0), leading to a win condition.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by ensuring that all 'box' sprites are gone from the layout (SpriteCounter stype=box = 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The game's mechanics do not explicitly mention a loss condition; however, running out of viable moves or getting stuck could lead to a situation where the player cannot achieve the win condition.\n\n**Suggested Overall Strategy:**  \n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Before making any moves with the avatar, take a moment to analyze the layout of the boxes, holes, and walls. Remember that walls will cause the avatar to bounce back, so plan your approach carefully.\n2. **Incremental Progress:** Focus on flipping the boxes into holes one at a time\u2014use the avatar to move the boxes successfully while avoiding getting blocked by walls or bouncing back unnecessarily.\n3. **Utilize Transformations:** Transform boxes into 'boxin' whenever possible by positioning them over the holes. Keep an eye on the score changes as this is integral to the game\u2019s success.\n4. **Efficiency:** Try to create pathways that allow multiple boxes to be pushed along with fewer moves; this will help you reach the victory condition faster.\n5. **Adapt to Hurdles:** If a box becomes stuck due to the laid-out walls, look for alternative routes or strategies to move it from its position.\n\nBy understanding the layout and mechanics, players can devise thoughtful strategies to effectively clear all boxes from the level and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, my avatar (denoted as 'a') is positioned at (3, 6). There are two boxes (denoted as '@') located at (2, 2) and (3, 2). Additionally, there are two holes (denoted as '#') located at (3, 5) and (3, 7). My goal is to manipulate the boxes to fall into the holes, thereby changing them into the powered-up state ('boxin').\n\nGiven the avatar's current position, the potential immediate actions include moving left, right, up, or down. Let's evaluate possible actions:\n\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2, 5)**: This position has a hole (#). If I move left, the avatar will position itself adjacent to a hole, but it won\u2019t allow for immediate manipulation of a box.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2, 7)**: This position has a hole (#). The same issue applies as it would not allow for box manipulation right away.\n3. **ACTION_UP (2, 6)**: This position is floor (.), and I would still need to move back down to manipulate the boxes.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (4, 6)**: This position is also ground (.), and would not lead to any immediate progress either.\n\nIn this scenario, moving left to (3, 5) seems most beneficial, as it positions me directly next to a hole and allows for action in the next move to potentially push a box into the hole.\n\nBased on this analysis, I choose:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis will allow me to move closer to a hole and set up for a future action to push a box into it. I expect to see an effective layout for further moves right after this action.",
