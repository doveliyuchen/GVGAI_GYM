It\u2019s very similar in spirit to Sokoban, where you push boxes around to solve puzzles.\n\u2003\u2013 The twist is that you aren\u2019t just pushing boxes into target zones\u2014you\u2019re transforming them by interacting with special tiles (holes and ground).\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 You control an avatar who can push boxes (the \u201cbox\u201d sprites). There are walls that block movement (the avatar will step back on hitting these) and hidden floor or ground tiles that play a role in the box transformation process.\n\u2003\u2013 When a box is pushed onto a hole (marked by a dark blue tile image), it transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d object and you score a point (+1). This transformation effectively removes one \u201cbox\u201d from the count tracked in the win condition.\n\u2003\u2013 However, if a \u201cboxin\u201d then comes into contact with a ground tile, it reverts to being a \u201cbox\u201d and you lose a point (\u20131). So boxes must be kept \u201csafe\u201d after transformation.\n\u2003\u2013 There are also interactions involving an extra sprite called \u201cbbox\u201d that affect collisions, ensuring that if the avatar pushes too hard or boxes collide with walls in a certain way, the game can \u201cundo\u201d previous moves.\n\n\u2022 Objective & Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The win condition is tied to the number of boxes left; you win when the number of sprites classified as \u201cbox\u201d reaches zero. In other words, you must transform all boxes into their safe form (boxin) and avoid having them revert back.\n\u2003\u2013 There are implicit puzzles around movement and pushing, since you must avoid situations where a transformed box (\u201cboxin\u201d) drifts onto a ground tile and turns back into a \u201cbox.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Plan your moves carefully. Since every box must eventually be pushed over a hole (to become \u201cboxin\u201d) and then not come in contact with ground, plan your route to ensure that transformed boxes are left on stable, safe spots.\n\u20032. Use the environment to your advantage. Understand the layout: walls block you, and hidden floor/ground tiles are in the background\u2014keeping track of which areas will revert a box is key.\n\u20033. Act methodically \u2013 each push counts. Avoid unnecessary pushing that might slide a box off a safe zone. If a box is touching a hole, get it off quickly and ensure it does not end up on a ground tile.\n\u20034. Remember to think ahead. Similar to traditional puzzles, you might have to \u201cundo\u201d some moves (as hinted in the bbox interaction with walls) if things go wrong. Sometimes pulling back and re-planning your approach might be needed to avoid flipping a successful transformation.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re playing a puzzle game where your knight must maneuver through a maze of walls and hidden pitfalls to push boxes toward holes that permanently transform them. The challenge is to clear the level by converting all boxes while ensuring they don\u2019t revert back by touching the ground. The key is to consider each push carefully and plan your moves around the level layout.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
