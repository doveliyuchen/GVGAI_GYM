You control an avatar (a knight) and push boxes around a grid-like level.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 The level is bounded by walls and contains special tiles (like holes and floors) that affect the boxes when you push them.\n\n\u2022 Key Game Elements and Their Roles\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 The Avatar: You control the knight. Your movement is restricted by walls (touching a wall makes you step back) so you need to plan your moves.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Boxes: Represented as \u201cbox\u201d sprites, these are the objects you need to manipulate. Your goal is to remove them from the win-condition count.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Holes: When you push a box onto a hole tile, the box transforms into a \u201cboxin\u201d type and you get a little score bonus. Importantly, these \u201cboxin\u201ds no longer count as boxes.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Floors and Ground: Although both are immovable, they are used to determine how boxes behave. In particular, if a \u201cboxin\u201d moves back onto a ground tile, it transforms back to a regular \u201cbox\u201d (with a score penalty). This means that where you leave your boxes is very important.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Walls: They block movement for both you and the boxes. Sometimes, they trigger an \u201cundo\u201d in certain interactions, so keep in mind that pushing too carelessly against walls may undo your previous moves.\n\n\u2022 Game Mechanics and Objective\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Moving and pushing: You navigate the level and use your avatar to push boxes. When you bump into boxes, there is a \u201cbounce forward\u201d effect that moves them.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Transformations: The core mechanic revolves around moving boxes onto the correct tiles. Pushing a box onto a hole transforms it into boxin \u2013 effectively \u201clocking it in\u201d as no longer needing to be moved.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Retaining progress: However, if a boxin accidentally touches a ground tile, it reverts back to a box. Therefore, you must work carefully to ensure that once a box is on a hole (or in a safe spot away from ground), it stays that way.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Win condition: The game ends in a win when there are no \u201cbox\u201d sprites left (i.e. all boxes have successfully been transformed into boxin). There isn\u2019t a specified loss condition here, but an incorrect move might force you into a puzzle unsolvable state.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\u2002\u20021. Plan Your Routes: Look ahead and figure out how to push boxes onto the hole tiles without them sliding off onto normal ground. Consider the order in which you need to move boxes.\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2022 Avoid unnecessary moves that may cause a boxin to accidentally come into contact with a ground tile.\n\u2002\u20022. Use Walls to Your Advantage: Since walls stop your movement (and even trigger undo effects in some interactions), use them as anchors that can help you control the movement of boxes.\n\u2002\u20023. Think in Steps: Just like in Sokoban, every push matters. Try to position yourself so that you can nudge the box exactly into the hole\u2014once a box is safely transformed (and not moved back by chance) you\u2019re one step closer to winning.\n\u2002\u20024. Mind the Transformations: Remember that boxes turn into boxin when in holes (gaining a score bonus) and can revert by touching ground. Your goal is locking in the transformation permanently, so plan moves that minimize unintended contact with ground tiles.\n\u2002\u20025. Manage Your Space: The level layout (with walls, floors, and holes) requires you to use your available space wisely. Sometimes you may need to push boxes into corners (or against walls) to prevent any accidental backward movement.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re solving a puzzle where you must tactically move boxes into special hole locations so they \u201cdisappear\u201d from the win counter. Each move requires forethought\u2014positioning boxes in a way that they complete the transformation without accidentally reverting back. With careful planning and mastering the game\u2019s bounce and undo mechanics, you\u2019ll eventually make it so no regular boxes remain and claim victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
