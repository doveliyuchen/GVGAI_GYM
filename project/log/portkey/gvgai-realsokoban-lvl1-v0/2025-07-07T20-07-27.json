Game Type and Genre:\n\u2003\u2022 This is a puzzle game with a grid\u2010based layout similar in spirit to Sokoban.\n\u2003\u2022 The player controls an avatar who must maneuver around walls and obstacles while interacting with boxes.\n\n2. Core Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement: The avatar moves around the grid. When it hits walls it \u201csteps back\u201d (preventing passage).\n\u2003\u2022 Object Interaction: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The avatar can push boxes. There is also a \u201cbbox\u201d element that seems to handle collision dynamics (e.g. when it meets the avatar it \u201cbounces forward\u201d and when it hits a wall it triggers an \u201cundo\u201d action, which suggests that some testing or resetting of moves might be involved).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Boxes (\u201cbox\u201d) can be pushed. When a box comes into contact with a hole (represented by a dark blue tile), it transforms into a different state (\u201cboxin\u201d) and the player earns points.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 However, if a \u201cboxin\u201d (a box on a hole) is then nudged onto the \u201cground\u201d (the basic floor tile), it transforms back into a box and the player loses some of the points earned.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 The primary goal is to eliminate all boxes in their original state. The termination condition states that the game is won when there are zero boxes (\u201cSpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True\u201d). \n\u2003\u2022 In practice, this means the player must move each box into a hole and have it transformed into a \u201cboxin\u201d state, ensuring it stays there without accidentally sliding back onto regular floor.\n\u2003\u2022 There might also be point considerations due to the score changes granted with these transformations.\n\n4. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Your Moves: Think ahead about where each box needs to go. Since boxes that leave the hole lose their \u201ctransformed\u201d status (and score), push them gently and in the right order.\n\u2003\u2022 Use the Environment: Walls and obstacles can help you align boxes. Use them to help stop a box at the right place so it doesn\u2019t roll away.\n\u2003\u2022 Minimize Mistakes: Be cautious with pushes so that once a box is on a hole, it isn\u2019t inadvertently nudged off. The undo interactions (triggered by collision events, such as \u201cbbox wall bbox > undoAll\u201d) hint that there might be a chance to reset or backtrack if you make an error.\n\u2003\u2022 Monitor Your Score: Since points are gained when a box transforms on a hole and lost if it reverts, try to maximize your score by keeping boxes in the correct positions.\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re looking at a thoughtful puzzle where careful maneuvering of boxes into holes is key. The game challenges you to keep track of which boxes have been \u201csecured\u201d on their targets while avoiding re-mixing those ready-to-win boxes back into movable ones. Coordinating your moves, using walls strategically, and planning ahead are all essential techniques for success.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\nboxin hole -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> a\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> @\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
