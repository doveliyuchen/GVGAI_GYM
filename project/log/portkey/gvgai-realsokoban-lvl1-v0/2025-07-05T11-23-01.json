    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. This is suggested by the presence of an avatar that moves around, interacts with different objects (boxes, walls, holes), and solves spatial challenges.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites which include:\n   - **Immovable objects** like walls, floor, and ground.\n   - **Moving avatar** which is likely the player-controlled character.\n   - **Passive bbox** that provides interactions without being directly controlled.\n   - **Transforming boxes** that can change states and affect the score.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can\u2019t pass through walls (bounces back).\n   - The avatar interacts with `bbox` to bounce forward, possibly changing positions.\n   - Boxes can be pushed into holes, transforming them to a slightly different type (boxin) and resulting in a score gain.\n   - When a boxin is placed on the ground, it returns to a regular box state and results in a score loss.\n\n3. **Transformations**: The primary gameplay mechanic involves transforming boxes strategically to either gain points or lose them, highlighting the puzzle aspect of the game.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective is to manipulate boxes so that there are no boxes remaining on the field (SpriteCounter limit of `box` reaches 0). Achieving this will result in a win. Your score is influenced by the number of transformations you perform since moving boxes into holes increases your score while placing them back on the ground reduces it.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: You win the game if the number of `box` sprites in play is reduced to zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: There doesn't appear to be an explicit loss condition mentioned. However, inefficient movement might lead to a situation where the player cannot remove all boxes from the level.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Strategic Planning**: Before making any moves, analyze the entire map and plan several moves ahead. Think about how boxes can be moved to holes and consider what transformations will yield the best score.\n\n2. **Maximize Box Transformations**: Always aim to push boxes into holes instead of placing them on the ground, as this transforms them into `boxin`, which is necessary for scoring points.\n\n3. **Avoid Reducing Score**: Be cautious not to place `boxin` back onto the ground unless absolutely necessary, as this will lower your score.\n\n4. **Utilize Bboxes**: Use the passive bbox to create advantageous situations where you can bounce forward or manipulate your position without interfering with wall collisions.\n\n5. **Experimentation**: If stuck, feeling free to retrace and experiment with different strategies, seeing how the arrangement changes with each move, can provide new insights.\n\nBy carefully planning and executing your moves with attention to the specific interactions outlined in the rules, you can effectively clear the level and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> @\nrow=2, col=3 -> @\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> a\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar ('a') is located at (3, 5) on the map, which is a position surrounded by walls and two holes. The nearest box ('@') is located at (2, 2) and (3, 2). \n\nTo make progress toward the objective of removing boxes, the strategy suggests we should focus on moving the avatar towards boxes for interaction. The quickest route to the closest box at (3, 2) is to move left from the position (3, 5):\n\n1. Move left to (3, 4) - this is clear ground.\n2. Move left again to (3, 3) - this is clear ground.\n3. Move left again to (3, 2) - where the box is located.\n\nRegarding the given mechanics, since the movement to the left is valid and would produce a movement towards a box for interaction, I will proceed to execute a left action.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action should effectively bring the avatar one step closer to interacting with a box, aligning well with the strategic plan to clear the level efficiently.",
