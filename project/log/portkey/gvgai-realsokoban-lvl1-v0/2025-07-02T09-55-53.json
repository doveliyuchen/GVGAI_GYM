    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, here's my analysis of the game based on the provided rules and level layout:\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle, likely a Sokoban-variant or sliding-block puzzle game.\n\n**Objective:** The player needs to manipulate the 'box' sprites into the 'hole' sprites, and then the box will transform into boxin and then the boxin will transform back to a box when it's on the ground. You win when there are no 'box' sprites remaining.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an 'avatar' and can move it around the level.\n*   **Immovable Objects:** 'floor','ground', 'hole', and 'wall' sprites are static and cannot be moved.\n*   **Pushing:** The avatar can likely push 'box' sprites. This is inferred from the 'stepBack' interaction with 'wall' sprites.\n*   **Transformation:** 'box' sprites transform into 'boxin' when pushed into a 'hole', increasing the score. 'boxin' sprites transform into 'box' sprites when pushed on the 'ground', decreasing the score.\n*   **Bouncing:** The avatar bounces off of a 'bbox' object. If both the avatar and the bbox are next to a wall, they bounce.\n\n**Win Condition:** The game is won when all 'box' sprites have been transformed, leaving zero remaining 'box' sprites.\n\n**Loss Condition:** Implicit loss condition - if the player gets a box stuck in a corner, that can be considered a loss because the game will no longer be winnable.\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Hole Placement:** Carefully plan the order in which you push boxes into holes. Think ahead to avoid blocking access to other boxes or holes.\n2.  **Avoid Corner Traps:** Be extremely cautious when pushing boxes near corners or walls. Once a box is stuck in a corner, it's often impossible to recover.\n3.  **Utilize Wall Interactions:** Be careful when utilizing wall interactions to help manipulate a box to the hole.\n\n**In summary,** this game is a puzzle where you push boxes into holes. Careful planning and spatial reasoning are essential to succeed.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> $\nrow=1, col=6 -> $\nrow=1, col=7 -> $\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> a\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> $\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> $\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> $\nrow=4, col=7 -> $\nrow=4, col=8 -> $\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> $\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> $\nrow=5, col=3 -> $\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> $\nrow=5, col=7 -> $\nrow=5, col=8 -> $\nrow=5, col=9 -> $\nrow=5, col=10 -> $\nrow=5, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> .\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .",
