Players are likely tasked with solving challenges using spatial reasoning and interactions between different sprites.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - **Immovable Sprites**: These include 'floor', 'ground', 'hole', and 'wall'. They represent static elements in the game environment.\n   - **Moving Avatar**: The player's character, represented as 'avatar', can move around and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: 'bbox' operates passively to interact with the avatar.\n   - **Dynamic Boxes**: 'box' and 'boxin' can be transformed based on their interactions with other sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can step back when hitting a wall.\n   - **Box Interaction**: When the avatar comes into contact with 'bbox', it bounces back. The transformation between 'box' and 'boxin' occurs based on the box\u2019s placement into the hole or onto the ground, affecting the score.\n   - **Score Management**: The game's score changes with specific interactions and affects the game state.\n\n3. **Game Elements**:\n   - **Box Placement**: The transformation of boxes into 'boxin' when placed into the hole and their reversion to 'box' on the ground is critical for score management.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to clear all 'box' sprites from the level, indicated by the winning condition of having no 'box' sprites left. Scoring and management of sprites play a significant role in achieving this objective.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game when the sprite counter for 'box' reaches zero.\n- **No explicit loss condition** is mentioned, which can imply that the focus is solely on winning through box management.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Carefully assess the layout and plan how to interact with boxes to optimize their placement.\n2. **Use the Hole Wisely**: Move boxes into the hole to convert them into 'boxin' and gain points. This transformation is crucial for reducing the number of boxes.\n3. **Avoid Unnecessary Moves**: Since bouncing the 'bbox' back only complicates the positioning, ensure that you position your avatar efficiently to minimize wasted moves.\n4. **Ground Management**: Ensure that any boxes transformed to 'boxin' can be properly dealt with later on; avoid creating a blockade with your movements.\n\nBy recognizing the interactions and leveraging the mechanics effectively, players can carefully navigate through the level to achieve the win condition. Focus on managing the boxes efficiently while keeping track of their transformations and the layout constraints.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor hole -> 'o'\nbox ground -> '*'\nground -> '.'\nground wall -> 'w'\nbox -> '@'\nhole -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\n$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$....$$$...$\n$........$.$\n$...$##a...$\n$@@@$$$$$$$$\n$$$$$$$$$$$$\n............\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\n.$$$$$$\n.$@...$\n.$@...$\n.$@...$\n.$$$..$\n.$$#.$$\n.$$#.$$\n.$$a.$$\n.$$...$\n.$$.$.$\n.$$...$\n.$$$$$$",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, let's understand the layout and position of all the elements:\n\n1. **Avatar ('a') Position**: The avatar ('a') is located at (3, 8) in the original state, and at (6, 3) in the rotated state. \n2. **Boxes ('@')**: There are three boxes, which are located at (5, 6), (5, 5), and (5, 4) in the original state. \n3. **Holes ('#')**: The holes are located at (3, 6) and (3, 5) in the original state.\n4. **Walls ('$')**: Surrounding the play area are walls, preventing movement outside the designated space.\n\n### Analyze the Key Elements\n- The goal of the game revolves around manipulating the boxes by getting them into the holes for scoring.\n- The current position of the avatar suggests that it can potentially move to interact with the nearby boxes or holes to advance towards the win condition.\n\n### Possible Actions\nGiven the avatar's position, it can move up, down, left, or right, but must consider the walls and the proximity to boxes and holes.\n\n1. **Checking Upward Action (Direction Up)**: Moving up (3, 8) to (2, 8) would encounter a wall.\n2. **Checking Downward Action (Direction Down)**: Moving down (3, 8) to (4, 8) would also encounter a wall.\n3. **Checking Left Action (Direction Left)**: Moving left (3, 8) to (3, 7) reaches the ground, which does not hinder movement, allowing for further interactions with adjacent boxes.\n4. **Checking Right Action (Direction Right)**: Moving right (3, 8) to (3, 9) would encounter a wall.\n\n### Chosen Action\nThe best strategic action is to move left to (3, 7), where the avatar will have the opportunity to manipulate boxes potentially and work towards the holes.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to (3, 7) ensures the avatar stays mobile and opens up options for interacting with the boxes nearby, potentially leading to a successful box conversion and moving closer to the winning condition.",
