The interactions between various sprites (blocks, fire, water, etc.), the requirement to manipulate the environment to reach the goal, and the avatar's health points indicate classic puzzle-solving elements in a platformer context.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: \n  - **Ground, Water, Mud, Wall, Box**: These are the foundational environmental elements. They affect movement and interaction.\n  - **Fire and Bombs**: These act as dynamic elements that interact with the environment in a destructive way.\n  - **Lasers**: They serve as dynamic projectiles that interact with certain sprites.\n  - **Goal (Door)**: The target the avatar must reach to win the level.\n\n- **Interactions**: \n  - The avatar can interact with various objects, including walls (which block movement), bombs (which transform into other forms or destroy), and fire (which can deal damage or affect other sprites such as turning water into mud).\n  - Interaction triggers include health reduction (when hitting fire) or changing the state of the sprites (e.g., water becoming mud).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the **goal** (green door) while navigating the level's challenges:\n- Avoid the **fire** and **water** that can harm or eliminate the avatar.\n- Use bombs strategically to manipulate the environment and create paths to the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: \n  - Successfully reaching the **goal** door with at least one avatar sprite remaining.\n  \n- **Loss Condition**:\n  - Losing all avatar sprites (health points dropping to zero).\n  - Timing out after 1000 ticks (game loops) without reaching the goal.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Planning the Route**: Before making any moves, mentally map out the route towards the goal, avoiding hazards such as fire and water. Note the positions of walls, boxes, and potential laser pathways.\n\n2. **Careful Use of Bombs**: Leverage bombs to create pathways or clear blocks. Bombs can also turn into **bombm** (missiles), which can attract other projectiles, allowing for strategic gameplay.\n\n3. **Managing Fire**: Be cautious around fire. They can damage the avatar and trigger chain reactions (e.g., the fire can destroy boxes that might otherwise be used as a stepping stone). \n\n4. **Environmental Manipulation**: Use interactions to your advantage. For instance, using fire to destroy water to transform it into mud, which can potentially be used to gain advantages.\n\n5. **Maintaining Health**: Since the avatar has a health system, avoid unnecessary risks (like running into fire) to prolong gameplay and give more time to plan. \n\n6. **Time Management**: Pay attention to the time limit. Ensure efficient movement and decision-making, focusing on reaching the door rather than engaging with every possible interactive element in the environment.\n\n7. **Iterative Approach**: If the player encounters a setback (losing health or failing to reach the goal), use the knowledge gained from each attempt to adjust strategies for the next try.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, players can successfully navigate the level, overcome obstacles, and achieve the main objective of reaching the goal effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> $\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> @\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",
