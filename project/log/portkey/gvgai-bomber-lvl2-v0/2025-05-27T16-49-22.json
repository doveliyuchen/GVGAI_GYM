It involves navigating through a grid-based environment, interacting with various sprites to overcome challenges.\n\n**Mechanics**:  \n- **Sprites**: The game contains various types of sprites including immovable elements (walls, water, mud), destructible objects (boxes, bombs, fire), spawn points, and the player avatar.\n- **Avatar**: The player controls an avatar that can move across the ground and interact with other sprites. \n- **Bombs**: The player can collect bombs, which can transform into bomb missiles upon contact with the avatar. Bombs can also interact with environmental elements, causing changes in state (e.g., transforming water into mud).\n- **Fire Mechanics**: Fire can spread and destroy specific elements, creating hazards. The interaction between fire, water, and bombs adds an element of strategy to gameplay.\n- **Goal**: The objective is to reach or destroy the 'goal' sprite to win the game.\n\n**Objective**:  \nThe main objective is to destroy the goal sprite while avoiding hazards and strategically using items like bombs and fire.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:  \n- **Win**: The game is won if the avatar successfully reaches (or destroys) the goal sprite.\n- **Loss**: The game is lost if:\n  - The avatar loses all health points.\n  - The avatar runs out of available sprites (indicated by the sprite counter for the avatar reaching zero).\n  - A timeout occurs (limit is 1000).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand the Environment**: Familiarize yourself with the game layout and the interaction rules of each sprite type. Notably, avoid water and fire as they can be lethal or damaging.\n\n2. **Use Bombs Effectively**: Bombs are crucial for creating opportunities. Deploy them strategically to destroy boxes that may obstruct your path or to eliminate tiles that might pose a threat.\n\n3. **Manipulate Fire**: Utilize fire to create pathways or destroy obstacles. Remember that fire can also interact with water, transforming it into mud, which might be beneficial in navigation.\n\n4. **Stay Healthy**: Maintain your avatar\u2019s health by avoiding interactions with fire and water, which can subtract health points or destroy the avatar. Monitor your health status regularly.\n\n5. **Pacing and Planning**: The game has a timeout condition, so plan your moves carefully and work towards the goal efficiently. Movement should be deliberate, considering the potential interactions with existing elements.\n\n6. **Utilize Re-spawning Points**: If there are areas in the layout that allow for re-spawning or regeneration of health or resources, make use of them to ensure your sustainability.\n\n7. **Keep an Eye on Hazard Spread**: Be cautious of areas where fire may spread or create obstacles, such as additional fire sprites or obstacles created by bomb interactions.\n\nBy devising a strategy that maximizes the use of items and avoids known hazards, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating the level and reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> $\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> @\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",

There are several obstacles (boxes) between the avatar and the goal, and the avatar needs to clear a path in order to reach or destroy the goal.\n\n### Available Actions Analysis\n\n1. **ACTION_NIL (0)**: No effect, so not a viable option.\n2. **ACTION_USE (1)**: This action could be useful if there are items collected by the avatar that can assist in reaching the goal.\n3. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Moving left from (9, 9) leads to (9, 8), which is a box ('@'). This action is blocked.\n4. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Moving right leads to (9, 10) which is empty ('.'), but does not contribute directly to reaching the goal.\n5. **ACTION_DOWN (4)**: Moving down to (10, 9) is blocked by a wall ('$').\n6. **ACTION_UP (5)**: Moving up to (8, 9) lands on an empty tile ('.'), providing a potential route to maneuver around the obstacles.\n\nGiven all the available options and the layout of the environment, the best action to take is to move **up** to try to navigate around the boxes.\n\n``` Action:5 ```\nMoving up is necessary to create a clear pathway towards the goal.
