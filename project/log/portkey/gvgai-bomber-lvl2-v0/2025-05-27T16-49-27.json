Players must navigate through a level filled with obstacles and interact with various sprites to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Various types of sprites serve different functions:\n   - **Terrain**: Ground, water, mud, walls.\n   - **Interactive Objects**: Boxes, bombs, lasers, fire.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character with health and the ability to shoot bombs.\n   - **Goals**: A door that signifies the end of the level.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The avatar can interact with walls, water, and the goal.\n   - Bombs can be transformed and utilized to trigger other interactions.\n   - Fire can spread and impact other sprites, resulting in various transformations or eliminations.\n\n3. **Health and Damage**: The avatar has health points and can be harmed by fire. There are conditions for \"killing\" or transforming sprites based on interactions.\n\n4. **Sprite Count Rules**: The game keeps track of certain sprite types, with winning or losing conditions dependent on their counts.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate the level, interact with the environment, and ultimately reach the green door (goal sprite). Players must manage health points and avoid hazards while solving the puzzle of reaching the goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the count of the goal sprite reaches zero after the avatar interacts with it.\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The player loses if the avatar's sprite count reaches zero (i.e., the avatar is eliminated).\n  - The player also loses if a timeout occurs (1000 ticks).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore Cautiously**: Start by exploring the level while avoiding immediate hazards like fire or water which kill the avatar. Carefully observe the environment and available sprites.\n\n2. **Use Bombs Strategically**: Utilize bombs to interact with fire and other objects. Bombs can transform into spark states that may clear certain paths or triggers when combined with other items (like fire or boxes).\n\n3. **Manage Health**: Keep an eye on the health points of the avatar. Avoid unnecessary damage from fire or interactions that would reduce health.\n\n4. **Utilize Fire**: Since fire can spread and impact different sprites (such as turning water into mud or killing boxes), use it to your advantage to clear paths or create opportunities.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route**: The layout suggests walls and rows of obstacles. Plan a route that maximizes interaction opportunities while avoiding traps and enemies.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Be mindful of the timeout limit. Keep a steady pace to explore and interact without rushing, but don\u2019t delay unnecessarily.\n\n7. **Checkpoints**: If possible, identify points in the level where you can safely retreat or rethink your strategy if you find yourself in danger.\n\nIn summary, the game combines strategic planning, environmental interaction, and careful navigation, demanding both puzzle-solving and quick reflexes from players.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> $\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> @\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",
