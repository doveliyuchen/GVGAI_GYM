    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here is a detailed analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-based platformer** with elements of strategy and resource management, where players control an avatar in a grid-based map, interacting with various objects and managing hazards to reach a goal.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites (Game Elements)**:\n   - **Ground, Water, Mud, Walls, Boxes**: Represent different terrains, with specific interactions (like instant death in water).\n   - **Lasers and Bombs**: Weapons that can be manipulated or transformed based on interactions, adding layers to problem-solving.\n   - **Fire**: A hazard that can spread and has specific interactions with other objects, leading to various consequences.\n   - **Goal (Green Door)**: The endpoint that players must reach to win the game.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - Players can walk on the ground, but touching water results in failure.\n   - Using bombs on certain objects can lead to transformations (e.g., bombs can turn into sparking objects), altering the game's landscape.\n   - Fire can destroy specific objects and must be handled carefully to avoid harming the avatar.\n   - Contact with the goal results in victory, while running out of health or time results in loss.\n\n3. **Health and Scoring**: \n   - The avatar has a limited number of health points (10). Health decreases upon touching fire, introducing a risk-reward mechanic.\n   - Interactions with certain objects (like boxes) can provide score changes.\n\n### Objective\n- The main objective is to navigate the avatar through the level, avoiding hazards (like water and fire) while utilizing items (like bombs) effectively to reach the goal (the green door).\n- Players must strategize movement, timing, and interaction to successfully navigate the puzzle.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: Reaching the goal (green door) with at least one avatar remaining.\n- **Loss**: Losing all avatars, running out of time (1000 ticks), or touching fatal hazards (water/fire).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Planning Movement**: Analyze the level layout before moving. Identify potential hazards and safe paths.\n2. **Bomb Management**: Use bombs wisely. They can transform into different sprites, which can either help solve puzzles or create new hazards. \n3. **Control Fire**: Fire can spread quickly; manage interactions to eliminate it or manipulate it effectively without harming the avatar.\n4. **Stay Clear of Hazards**: Avoid water at all costs as it is an instant death trap. Additionally, steer clear of fire unless you have a plan to control or avoid it effectively.\n5. **Monitor Health**: Keep track of the avatar's health. Avoid needless damage from fire or other hazards to ensure you can reach the goal effectively.\n6. **Use Sparking Objects**: When bombs transform into spark objects, they can attract attention (as indicated by their function); use them to clear paths or create safe zones.\n\nOverall, employ a mixture of caution, strategic planning, and adaptive problem-solving to guide your avatar safely to the goal while maximizing score and managing health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
