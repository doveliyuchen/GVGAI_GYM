It combines elements of spatial reasoning with mechanics that involve manipulating the environment (e.g., using bombs and fire) to solve levels and progress.\n\n#### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game contains various immovable objects (walls, ground, water, mud, boxes) and interactive objects (bombs, lasers, fire, and the player's avatar).\n2. **Interaction Mechanics**:\n   - The player (avatar) can interact with the environment, but certain interactions result in losing health or transforming sprites.\n   - Bombs can be used strategically to eliminate obstacles (like boxes) or create new pathways (turning water into mud).\n   - Fire has a spread mechanic and can destroy boxes, while certain transformations can affect gameplay (e.g., bombs becoming spark).\n3. **Health System**: The avatar has health points, and certain interactions with fire will decrease this health.\n   \n#### Objective:\nThe main objectives of the game are to:\n- Navigate through the level by overcoming obstacles (walls, water).\n- Reach the goal (green door).\n- Manage resources (bombs) and health while solving the level.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the green door (goal) before their health points drop to zero or the timer runs out.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The game ends unfavorably if:\n  - The avatar's health points reach zero.\n  - The player fails to reach the goal within the set time limit (1000 units/time).\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management**: Carefully use bombs to clear obstacles and open pathways. Avoid unnecessary damage from fires and keep an eye on health points.\n2. **Observation**: Pay attention to the interactions of various sprites. Knowing how bombs, fire, and other elements affect the environment is key to solving puzzles.\n3. **Timing**: Act quickly to ensure that environmental changes (like water turning into mud) don't damage your progress, especially with fire spreading.\n4. **Planning Pathways**: Think ahead to create pathways that will allow safe passage to the goal while avoiding trap hazards (like walls and fire).\n5. **Iterate**: If you find yourself in a tough situation, utilize the restarting mechanisms (returning to saved points or using avatars wisely) to rethink your strategy.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the challenges presented in this puzzle-platformer, leading to successful completion of levels while maintaining health and resource management.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nbox ground -> 'e'\nbomb ground -> 'b'\nground -> ','\nwater -> '.'\nlcup ground -> '1'\nlcright ground -> '2'\nlcdown ground -> '3'\nlcleft ground -> '4'\nbox -> '@'\ngoal -> '#'\nwall -> '$'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> $\nrow=0, col=1 -> $\nrow=0, col=2 -> $\nrow=0, col=3 -> $\nrow=0, col=4 -> $\nrow=0, col=5 -> $\nrow=0, col=6 -> $\nrow=0, col=7 -> $\nrow=0, col=8 -> $\nrow=0, col=9 -> $\nrow=0, col=10 -> $\nrow=0, col=11 -> $\nrow=0, col=12 -> $\nrow=0, col=13 -> $\nrow=0, col=14 -> $\nrow=0, col=15 -> $\nrow=0, col=16 -> $\nrow=0, col=17 -> $\nrow=0, col=18 -> $\nrow=1, col=0 -> $\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> #\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> $\nrow=2, col=0 -> $\nrow=2, col=1 -> $\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> $\nrow=2, col=7 -> $\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> $\nrow=2, col=12 -> $\nrow=2, col=13 -> $\nrow=2, col=14 -> $\nrow=2, col=15 -> $\nrow=2, col=16 -> $\nrow=2, col=17 -> $\nrow=2, col=18 -> $\nrow=3, col=0 -> $\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> @\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> @\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> @\nrow=3, col=18 -> $\nrow=4, col=0 -> $\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> $\nrow=5, col=0 -> $\nrow=5, col=1 -> @\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> @\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> @\nrow=5, col=8 -> @\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> @\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> @\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> @\nrow=5, col=18 -> $\nrow=6, col=0 -> $\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> $\nrow=7, col=0 -> $\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> .\nrow=7, col=18 -> $\nrow=8, col=0 -> $\nrow=8, col=1 -> @\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> @\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> @\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> @\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> @\nrow=8, col=11 -> @\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> @\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> @\nrow=8, col=16 -> .\nrow=8, col=17 -> @\nrow=8, col=18 -> $\nrow=9, col=0 -> $\nrow=9, col=1 -> @\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> a\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> .\nrow=9, col=16 -> .\nrow=9, col=17 -> @\nrow=9, col=18 -> $\nrow=10, col=0 -> $\nrow=10, col=1 -> $\nrow=10, col=2 -> $\nrow=10, col=3 -> $\nrow=10, col=4 -> $\nrow=10, col=5 -> $\nrow=10, col=6 -> $\nrow=10, col=7 -> $\nrow=10, col=8 -> $\nrow=10, col=9 -> $\nrow=10, col=10 -> $\nrow=10, col=11 -> $\nrow=10, col=12 -> $\nrow=10, col=13 -> $\nrow=10, col=14 -> $\nrow=10, col=15 -> $\nrow=10, col=16 -> $\nrow=10, col=17 -> $\nrow=10, col=18 -> $",
