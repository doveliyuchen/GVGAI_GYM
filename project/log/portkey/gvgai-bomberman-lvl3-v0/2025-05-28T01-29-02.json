    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the rules and descriptions provided for this game, here's an analysis of its genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to fall under the **Puzzle/Action** genre, reminiscent of classic games like \"Bomberman.\" Players control a character (the Bomberman) and must navigate through a maze while strategically using bombs to interact with blocks and enemies.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites (Characters and Objects)**:\n   - The player uses a *Bomberman* character to place bombs.\n   - There are various enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions) and a specific *goal* (green door) to reach.\n   - There are different types of bombs, which may have varying effects during the game.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Bombs can destroy walls and may spawn additional bombs when interacted with.\n   - Bomb explosions can kill both enemies and the player if placed poorly.\n   - The player can earn points (score change) by defeating enemies or reaching specific goals.\n\n3. **Level Structure**:\n   - The game features a grid-based layout (walls, open spaces, and the goal door).\n   - Walls cannot be destroyed unless bombed, while special walls can be destroyed to create pathways.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the green door (goal) while avoiding death at the hands of enemies and explosions. Points can be scored by eliminating enemies and completing the level efficiently.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite (green door). The game recognizes this by checking if the sprite counter for the goal reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the Bomberman sprite's counter reaches zero, indicating the player's defeat.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Bomb Placement**: Carefully plan where to place bombs. Try to trap enemies in pathways you create or use bombs to break down walls that block your route to the goal.\n\n2. **Avoiding Explosions**: Be mindful of your surroundings and potential chain reactions. Don\u2019t place bombs too close to yourself, or they could backfire.\n\n3. **Enemy Management**: Engage with enemies strategically. If possible, lure them into explosion paths or use bombs to defeat them before they pose a threat.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Collect and make use of bombs effectively. Timing your placements to maximize damage to both walls and enemies is crucial.\n\n5. **Pathfinding**: Always look for alternate routes to the goal and use walls that can be broken down to create strategic pathways to maneuver around enemies.\n\nBy applying these strategies, players can enhance their chances of reaching the goal and scoring points while navigating the maze effectively. Understanding the mechanics and utilizing them wisely will lead to success in this puzzle-action game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_8 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_7 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_6 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_5 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_4 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\nbomb_8 -> 'l'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> %\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> *\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=17 -> *\nrow=5, col=18 -> b\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> @\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> k\nrow=7, col=16 -> #\nrow=7, col=17 -> l\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, we need to identify the position of the Bomberman (which is represented as `#`) and consider the surrounding entities, particularly enemies (bats represented as `@`, scorpions represented as `%`, and spiders represented as `&`), walls (`*`), and breakable walls (`b`). \n\nFrom the map, we can see the following important details:\n- The Bomberman is currently located at (7, 16).\n- The green goal is located at (2, 5).\n- A bat is located at (7, 1), and another bat is at (1, 4), which we need to avoid.\n- Breakable walls (`b`) are located in various positions that can possibly create paths and routes to maneuver and reach the goal safely.\n\nGiven these observations, the best course of action typically consists of moving towards the goal while being mindful of enemies.\n\nSince the current state is safe and the Bomberman hasn't moved recently, I will attempt to move **Left** to position (7, 15) which does not directly put me in danger from the bat at (1, 4) or other enemies I can see.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the Bomberman left towards a more strategic position, getting closer to possible bomb placements near the breakable walls for future moves.",
