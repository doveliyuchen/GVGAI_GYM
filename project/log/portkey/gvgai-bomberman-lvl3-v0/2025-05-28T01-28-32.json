Given the use of bombs and enemies, it may draw inspiration from classic games like \"Bomberman.\"\n\n#### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Player Character:** The player controls a 'bomberman' avatar capable of planting bombs to manipulate the game environment.\n2. **Bombs:** The ability to spawn and place bombs, which create explosions that can destroy certain walls and enemies.\n3. **Enemies:** There are various enemies (bats, spiders, scorpions) that move randomly and can kill the player if they come into contact.\n4. **Explosions:** Bombs create explosions in multiple directions, which can impact both the surroundings and the player.\n5. **Goal:** The objective is to reach a green door ('goal') while managing resources (bombs) and avoiding or eliminating enemies.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to reach the 'goal' (green door) while strategically using bombs to navigate through walls and defeat enemies.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins when they reach the 'goal' sprite. This is indicated by the condition that the sprite counter for 'goal' reaches 0.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the 'bomberman' sprite counter reaches 0, indicating the player's character has been defeated.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves:** Before placing bombs, consider the layout and plan your path to ensure that bombs are placed where they will create useful openings or eliminate enemies.\n\n2. **Enemy Awareness:** Monitor enemy positions closely. Since they move randomly, it can be beneficial to predict their paths. Use bombs to kill enemies when they are near but remain mindful of the risk of self-destruction.\n\n3. **Use Bombs Wisely:** Bombs can destroy walls and hinder enemy movement. Use them to create escape routes or to isolate enemies, making it easier to defeat them.\n\n4. **Avoid Self-Destruction:** Ensure that you do not step into the area of a bomb after it explodes. It is useful to understand the timing and range of each bomb to avoid this.\n\n5. **Retreat When Necessary:** If overwhelmed by enemies or in a precarious position, don't hesitate to retreat and reassess the situation rather than forcing a confrontation.\n\n6. **Explore the Level:** Familiarize yourself with the level layout and look for hidden paths or additional bomb resources, which can be crucial for sustaining your ability to deal with enemies.\n\n7. **Focus on the Goal:** Always keep the goal in mind. While defeating enemies is beneficial for scoring, your ultimate objective is to reach the goal, so prioritize actions that get you closer to that objective.\n\nBy integrating these strategies while keeping a close eye on enemy movements and bomb placement, players can navigate the challenges presented and succeed in reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 -> 'i'\nbomb_9 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_8 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> %\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> @\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> &\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> %\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> *\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=17 -> *\nrow=5, col=18 -> b\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> k\nrow=7, col=17 -> #\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

There is also a wall directly to the left (at (7, 16)), preventing movement in that direction. The goal is to reach the green door at (2, 5) while managing the enemies and obstacles effectively.\n\nSince I can't move left, and I need to find a way to progress without staying stationary, I will choose to move **down** to (8, 17). This action will allow me to position myself to assess my options next turn, as it opens up pathways around me rather than accumulating position without movement.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nMoving down is strategic as it gives me more options to navigate around potential enemies and opens up space for future moves toward the goal.",
