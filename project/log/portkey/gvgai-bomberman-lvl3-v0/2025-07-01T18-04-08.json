Bombs can also spawn explosions that can damage the bomberman and others. Bombs seem to have varying levels (bomb_1 through bomb_10), suggesting a progression in power or effect.\n- **Enemies**: Random NPCs (bats, spiders, scorpions) that may pose threats to the player. Interaction with enemies leads to damage or death for the bomberman.\n- **Goal**: Reaching a specified goal (the green \"door\") grants points and advances the game.\n- **Wall Mechanics**: There are destructible (wallBreak) and non-destructible (wall) walls that affect movement and strategy.\n- **Combat**: The player can attack enemies with bombs but must be cautious of friendly fire.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objectives are to:\n- Reach the goal (green door) to win the game, earning points.\n- Manage bomb placements to navigate obstacles and defeat enemies.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The game is won when the bomberman reaches the goal, as indicated by the termination condition where the \"goal\" sprite counter reaches zero.\n- **Loss**: The game is lost when the bomberman counter reaches zero, meaning the player has exhausted all lives.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout and obstacles. This will help in planning bomb placements and movements.\n2. **Bomb Placement**: Use bombs strategically to clear pathways or enemy threats. Be cautious of the bomb\u2019s blast radius\u2014position yourself to avoid self-damage.\n3. **Enemy Management**: Observe enemy patterns and utilize bombs to take them out before they can damage you. Prioritize enemies based on threat level (e.g. scorpions may be more dangerous than bats).\n4. **Controlled Progression**: Make one move at a time and analyze each turn. Ensure that bomb placements do not corner you or lead to unnecessary damage.\n5. **Utilize Destruction**: Use wall-breaking bombs wisely to create new pathways and gain an advantage over enemy placements.\n6. **Avoid Traps**: Be aware of explosions and their potential to cause chain reactions. Stay in safer positions when using powerful bombs.\n\nBy focusing on careful planning, strategic bomb usage, and enemy avoidance, players have a better chance of navigating through levels effectively while securing a win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_9 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_8 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_7 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_6 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_5 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_4 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_3 -> 'i'\nbomb_2 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_1 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\nexplosionLeft -> 'l'\nexplosionLeft explosionUp -> 'm'\nexplosionUp -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> %\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=16 -> %\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> *\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=17 -> *\nrow=5, col=18 -> b\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> n\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> #\nrow=7, col=17 -> l\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

I should assess the enemy threats; the scorpion (high threat) and bats (medium threat).\n2. I could potentially create pathways with bombs and defeat nearby enemies to make it easier to reach the goal.\n\nSince my last position has not changed, I need to perform a different action.
