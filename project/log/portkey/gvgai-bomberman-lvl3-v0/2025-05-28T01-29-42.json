The setup includes elements akin to **Bomberman**, where players place bombs to affect the gameplay environment and defeat enemies.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites/Entities:**\n   - **Bomberman:** The player's avatar, capable of placing bombs and moving through the level.\n   - **Goal:** Represents the end objective; reaching this area rewards points.\n   - **Enemies:** Various enemies (notably bats, spiders, scorpions) which can harm the player.\n   - **Bombs:** Different bomb types are used to destroy walls and defeat enemies.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that can be destroyed with bombs.\n   - **Explosions:** Caused by bombs, affecting surrounding areas, can harm the player and enemies.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Bombs kill enemies and break walls when detonated.\n   - The player loses if they are killed by enemies or by their own bombs.\n   - Reaching the goal scores points, and defeating enemies scores additional points.\n\n3. **Movement and Actions:**\n   - The Bomberman can place bombs, move around the grid, and must strategize to avoid enemy attacks while trying to eliminate them.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- **Primary Objective:** Reach the goal to win.\n- **Secondary Objective:** Increase score by defeating enemies and blowing up walls to progress.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the Bomberman reaches the goal (denoted as \"A\").\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the Bomberman is killed (SpritesCounter for Bomberman reaches 0).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Assess the Environment:**\n   Begin by surveying the level for walls (marked as 'w'), enemies, and the location of the goal. Plan your movements based on the enemy positioning.\n\n2. **Utilize Bombs Wisely:**\n   Use bombs to create paths through walls and to incapacitate enemies. Remember to maintain a safe distance when placing bombs, as they can also harm you.\n\n3. **Enemy Management:**\n   Identify the cooldowns of various enemies. Utilize the bombs to lure enemies into the detonation area or to maintain a safe distance while you take them out.\n\n4. **Point Maximization:**\n   Aim to maximize your score by focusing on destroying as many enemies as possible before heading to the goal. Collect the score benefits from defeating enemies as you progress.\n\n5. **Path Planning:**\n   Always plan your path to avoid getting trapped. Ensure you have alternative routes if your current path is blocked by enemies or walls.\n\n6. **Strategic Retreat:**\n   If overwhelmed by enemies, consider retreating to a safer area or using bombs defensively to create space until you can regroup.\n\n7. **Avoid Self-Destruction:**\n   Keep track of your bomb placements and the potential chain reactions they create to avoid accidentally causing your own defeat.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can effectively navigate the challenges of the game while working towards their objectives. The combination of strategy and quick reactions will be crucial for success in this game setup.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 -> 's'\nbomb_7 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 -> 'i'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> %\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> %\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> *\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=17 -> *\nrow=5, col=18 -> b\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> j\nrow=7, col=17 -> #\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

There are enemies around (bats and a spider), a bomb placed at (7, 6), and a path leading towards the goal (located at (2, 5)).\n\n### Immediate Action Analysis:\n- The Bomberman can assess the immediate threats from the bat at (1, 5), the scorpion at (1, 7), and the spider at (5, 7).\n- The Bomberman can potentially use bombs to eliminate these enemies while creating pathways to progress towards the goal.\n- However, there is also a bomb explosion occurring at (7, 16), which poses a threat if the player is too close to it.\n\n### Current Action Strategy:\nTo avoid self-destruction from the bomb explosion happening at (7, 16), I can move to the left (position (7, 16) is unsafe). This will position the Bomberman in a safer zone.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect this action to reposition the Bomberman and maintain safety from the ongoing bomb explosion while allowing me to plan the next move towards defeating enemies and reaching the goal.",
