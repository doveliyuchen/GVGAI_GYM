Players must strategically navigate and interact with elements in the environment, utilizing bombs to defeat enemies and achieve game objectives, reminiscent of titles like *Bomberman* or similar strategy-based puzzle games.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n1. **Player Character**: The player controls a character resembling a bomber (bomberman), who can place bombs.\n2. **Bombs**: Players can spawn different types of bombs which affect both the environment and enemies.\n3. **Enemies**: There are various enemy types (bats, spiders, scorpions) that appear randomly and pose threats after a cooldown period.\n4. **Goal**: The objective is to reach the \u2018goal\u2019 door (green door) while manipulating bombs to eliminate threats and navigate the level.\n5. **Walls and Wall Breaks**: The environment includes walls that can block movement and potential destructible blocks that can be broken with explosions.\n\n#### Objective\n- **Primary Objective**: Reach the goal sprite (green door) and ensure that the player (bomberman) survives.\n- **Purpose of Bombs**: Use bombs strategically for offense (killing enemies) and to clear pathways.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if the bomberman reaches the goal door, gaining points.\n- The player loses when the bomberman\u2019s sprite counter reaches 0 (defined by their deaths due to enemy attack or self-inflicted bomb damage).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Safe Bomb Usage**: Carefully consider bomb placement to avoid self-damage. Use them to create pathways and eliminate enemies from a safe distance.\n2. **Enemy Awareness**: Keep track of enemy spawns and their cooldowns. Avoid being caught when enemies appear and use bombs to clear them before they can attack.\n3. **Pathfinding**: Observe the level layout to identify safe routes toward the goal. Use bombs to clear barriers if blocked.\n4. **Score Management**: Prioritize actions that lead to score increases, such as killing enemies and reaching the goal.\n5. **Adapt Strategy**: If the bomberman is overwhelmed, consider backtracking and reevaluating bomb placement for better positioning.\n6. **Utilize Power-ups**: If there are any collectible or different bomb types, adapt strategies based on their characteristics when available.\n\nBy focusing on strategic bomb placement, effective enemy management, and careful navigation, players can successfully navigate through the levels and achieve their objectives while avoiding loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_9 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 bomb_7 bomb_8 bomb_9 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 bomb_6 bomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 bomb_5 bomb_6 bomb_7 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 bomb_6 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> %\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> %\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> &\nrow=5, col=15 -> *\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=17 -> *\nrow=5, col=18 -> b\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> @\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> .\nrow=7, col=17 -> k\nrow=7, col=18 -> #\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",
