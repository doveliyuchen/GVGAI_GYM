    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, we can analyze the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, and suggest an overall strategy as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to be a strategic puzzle or maze game that incorporates elements of action, similar to titles like *Bomberman*. Players must navigate through a maze while using bombs to interact with their environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Characters**:\n     - **B bomberman**: The player-controlled character that can place bombs.\n     - **enemies**: Various NPCs in the form of bats, spiders, and scorpions that can hinder the player's progress.\n   - **Objects**:\n     - **Bombs**: Used to break walls or defeat enemies.\n     - **Walls and Breakable Walls**: Serve as obstacles.\n     - **Goal**: Represents the exit point that players must reach.\n   - **Explosions**: Bomberman's bombs cause explosions that can damage enemies, destroy walls, and affect the player if caught in the blast.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The bomberman interacts with walls, bombs, and enemies, utilizing bomb mechanics to progress.\n   - Explosions can clear paths and defeat enemies, but can also harm the player.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game is over if the bomberman is eliminated (lives reach 0).\n   - The player wins by reaching the goal.\n\n### Objectives\n- Navigate through the maze while strategically placing bombs to defeat enemies and clear paths to reach the goal.\n- Manage the bomberman\u2019s health, avoiding damage from both enemies and explosions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the goal (marked as 'A' in the level layout).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses when the number of sprites (lives) for the bomberman reaches 0, typically by colliding with enemies or getting caught in bomb explosions.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since the maze is filled with walls and enemies, careful planning of each move is crucial. Avoid getting trapped or bombed in close quarters.\n2. **Utilize Bombs Wisely**: Bombs can break walls and defeat enemies, but they can also harm you. Place bombs where they will clear paths while keeping a safe distance.\n3. **Control the Environment**: Use bombs to manipulate the maze. Destroy walls for potential shortcuts or to corner enemies.\n4. **Defeat Enemies Strategically**: If enemies are blocking paths, consider leading them into positions where they can be easily defeated by your bombs.\n5. **Avoiding Enemy Attacks**: Keep moving and watch enemy patterns to avoid confrontation. Stay vigilant for enemy movements and react quickly.\n6. **Reach the Goal**: Always keep the goal in mind. Clear a path by breaking walls and defeating enemies so you can reach the exit efficiently.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics, developing a solid strategy, and working carefully through the level, you can effectively navigate the game and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbat -> '@'\nbomberman -> '#'\ngoal wallBreak -> '$'\nscorpion -> '%'\nspider -> '&'\nwall -> '*'\nwallBreak -> 'b'\nbomb_9 -> 'g'\nbomb_8 bomb_9 -> 's'\nbomb_7 bomb_8 -> 'w'\nbomb_6 bomb_7 -> 'c'\nbomb_5 bomb_6 -> 'd'\nbomb_4 bomb_5 -> 'e'\nbomb_3 bomb_4 -> 'f'\nbomb_2 bomb_3 -> 'h'\nbomb_1 bomb_2 -> 'i'\nbomb_1 explosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'j'\nexplosionDown explosionLeft explosionRight explosionUp -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> *\nrow=0, col=1 -> *\nrow=0, col=2 -> *\nrow=0, col=3 -> *\nrow=0, col=4 -> *\nrow=0, col=5 -> *\nrow=0, col=6 -> *\nrow=0, col=7 -> *\nrow=0, col=8 -> *\nrow=0, col=9 -> *\nrow=0, col=10 -> *\nrow=0, col=11 -> *\nrow=0, col=12 -> *\nrow=0, col=13 -> *\nrow=0, col=14 -> *\nrow=0, col=15 -> *\nrow=0, col=16 -> *\nrow=0, col=17 -> *\nrow=0, col=18 -> *\nrow=0, col=19 -> *\nrow=1, col=0 -> *\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> b\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> b\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> *\nrow=2, col=0 -> *\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> $\nrow=2, col=6 -> *\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=14 -> %\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> .\nrow=2, col=17 -> .\nrow=2, col=18 -> .\nrow=2, col=19 -> *\nrow=3, col=0 -> *\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> b\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> *\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> *\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> *\nrow=4, col=0 -> *\nrow=4, col=1 -> b\nrow=4, col=2 -> *\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> *\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> &\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=16 -> .\nrow=4, col=17 -> .\nrow=4, col=18 -> .\nrow=4, col=19 -> *\nrow=5, col=0 -> *\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> @\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> b\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> *\nrow=5, col=16 -> b\nrow=5, col=17 -> *\nrow=5, col=18 -> b\nrow=5, col=19 -> *\nrow=6, col=0 -> *\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> *\nrow=6, col=7 -> b\nrow=6, col=8 -> *\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> *\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> .\nrow=6, col=17 -> .\nrow=6, col=18 -> .\nrow=6, col=19 -> *\nrow=7, col=0 -> *\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> k\nrow=7, col=17 -> #\nrow=7, col=18 -> .\nrow=7, col=19 -> *\nrow=8, col=0 -> *\nrow=8, col=1 -> *\nrow=8, col=2 -> *\nrow=8, col=3 -> *\nrow=8, col=4 -> *\nrow=8, col=5 -> *\nrow=8, col=6 -> *\nrow=8, col=7 -> *\nrow=8, col=8 -> *\nrow=8, col=9 -> *\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> *\nrow=8, col=13 -> *\nrow=8, col=14 -> *\nrow=8, col=15 -> *\nrow=8, col=16 -> *\nrow=8, col=17 -> *\nrow=8, col=18 -> *\nrow=8, col=19 -> *",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state and determine the best action, let's first identify the avatar's position. The avatar (denoted as '#') is located at (7, 17). \n\nFrom the given map and rules:\n- Our goal is represented by '$' and is located at (2, 5).\n- There are obstacles (walls '*'), enemies (bats '@', spiders '&', scorpions '%'), and breakable walls ('b') that we can interact with using bombs.\n\nThe immediate area around the avatar reveals the following positions:\n- (7, 16): 'k' (which I assume is some kind of bomb or trap).\n- (7, 18): '.' (open space).\n- (7, 17): '#' (our avatar).\n- (7, 19): '*' (wall, obstacle).\n\nSince the position of the avatar has not changed, and it is crucial to progress towards the goal and also avoid potential threats:\n1. There are potential threats nearby (bats @ at (5, 3) and (3, 3)).\n2. Direct paths to the goal (2, 5) are blocked by walls and enemies.\n\nConsidering the movement rules, I will try to move left to (7, 16). Given that it's a 'k', I can further analyze this position for a safe action choice.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nI expect moving left to (7, 16) to allow me to examine any possible bomb that can assist me in framing a path toward the goal ($ at (2, 5)).",
