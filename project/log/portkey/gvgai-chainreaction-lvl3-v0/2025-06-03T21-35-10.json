There are complex interactions where certain conditions affect sprite states (e.g., a boulder can transform into a `normalBoulder`, a `stoppingBoulder`, or `masterBoulder` depending on its encounters).\n\n- **Scoring:** Players get score adjustments based on interactions. Falling into a hole results in negative scores, while reaching the goal or manipulating boulders correctly yields positive points.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to reach the `goal` while avoiding certain pitfalls (`hole`, which incurs score penalties).\n- The player must successfully manage boulders to fulfill the victory condition of eliminating the `targetBoulders` when their count reaches zero.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win conditions:**\n  - The game is won if the number of `targetBoulders` reaches zero, indicating successful puzzle completion.\n  \n- **Loss conditions:**\n  - The player loses if:\n    - The `avatar` sprite count reaches zero.\n    - The number of `master` sprites reaches zero (implying critical failure).\n    - Timeout occurs within the set limits (1500).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestion\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Look ahead a few steps. Anticipate the chain reactions of your interactions with boulders and boxes. Consider how moving one object will affect others.\n\n2. **Manage the Boulders:**\n   - Understanding the state changes of `normalBoulders`, `stoppingBoulders`, and `masterBoulders` is crucial. Focus on transforming boulders into the `normalBoulders` state when needed, and be wary of how walls interact with these boulders.\n\n3. **Utilize the Goal and Holes:**\n   - Strive to manipulate the `boulders` carefully around the `goal` while avoiding `holes`. Having the maximum score will be beneficial, so plan to minimize any negative score impacts while progressing towards clearing `targetBoulders`.\n\n4. **Stepwise Execution:**\n   - Time your interactions correctly. Ensure the avatar doesn\u2019t end up in holes or backtrack unnecessarily by mismanaging the boulders. Each move should lead you closer to the goal or an advantageous state, minimizing setbacks.\n\n5. **Explore Alternative Routes:**\n   - Certain level configurations (indicated by the walls and gaps shown) may provide multiple pathways. Explore these options to find the shortest or most effective route to eliminate the target boulders.\n\nBy employing calculated strategies and managing sprites thoughtfully, players can successfully navigate through the challenges presented by the game while aiming for victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\nboulderm floor -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> $\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> a\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

The goal (`@`) is at positions (2, 2) and (7, 10).\n3. There are several holes (`#`) and various boulders (`%`, `$`), with normal boulders located nearby.\n\nBased on the game mechanics and strategies provided, reaching the goal and managing the boulders are essential objectives. From the avatar's position at (8, 10), the next best action could be to move upwards since we want to navigate through the space to reach the goal.\n\nI will execute a move upwards to try and navigate closer to the goal and analyze the state after the execution of this action.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should ideally bring the avatar closer to the goal and open up new moves to manage the necessary boulders.",
