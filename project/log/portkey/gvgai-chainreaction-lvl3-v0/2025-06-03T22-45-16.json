Players must navigate through obstacles and manipulate objects to reach a goal.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Sprites:** These include walls, holes, and goals which act as boundaries and obstacles.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that can interact with various objects in the level.\n   - **Dynamic Objects:** Boxes, boulders, and other types of rocks can be pushed or transformed based on interactions.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Boxes can be bounced off of walls or other objects, and they can interact with boulders to transform them into different states (e.g., normal to stopped).\n   - The avatar can attract or push boulders and manipulate boxes but must be careful to avoid holes and walls which can cause losses in terms of score or may lead to game over scenarios.\n\n3. **Scoring:** \n   - Different interactions yield varying score changes, indicating a strategic element where players might want to avoid certain actions leading to negative scores while seeking to maximize positive interactions.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar to achieve a final goal while managing the various rocks and other obstacles. Specifically, players must **transform enough boulders into target boulders** to meet the win condition.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:** \n  - The game is won if there are no target boulders remaining.\n- **Loss Conditions:** \n  - The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (leading to zero avatars), if there are no master boulders left, or if time runs out.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Before executing any moves, carefully assess the current layout and the positions of the boulders and boxes. \n   - Identify the fastest route to convert boulders into target boulders while ensuring you don\u2019t trap yourself with walls or holes.\n\n2. **Transform Wisely:**\n   - Prioritize interactions that allow you to convert boulders into desired states. Keep track of which boulders are useful and which are not.\n   - Pay attention to the speed of each boulder type. Both mboulders and boulders can be transformed, so use these conversions to your advantage.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes and Walls:**\n   - Keep your avatar away from holes to prevent score penalties. Walls can also lead to setbacks, so be mindful when making moves near them.\n\n4. **Utilize Box Mechanics:**\n   - Use boxes to bounce off and gain better positioning or to create advantageous conditions for boulders. \n   - Consider using boxes to manage the timing of your interactions with boulders.\n\n5. **Manage Time and Resources:**\n   - With a time limit, it's crucial to stay efficient. Don\u2019t get stuck in loops or ineffective maneuvers. Always think several moves ahead.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies and understanding the game mechanics and scoring system, players can effectively navigate challenges and work towards achieving the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> $\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> b\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> $\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

From my analysis:\n\n1. Moving left (action `ACTION_LEFT`, which corresponds to going to `(3, 1)`) leads to an empty space.\n2. Moving right (action `ACTION_RIGHT`, which would go to `(3, 3)`) allows interaction with a normal boulder, unlocking further potential transformations.\n\nTo act in accordance with the strategy of converting boulders while avoiding unnecessary moves, I will move to the right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should allow me to manipulate the normal boulder, aligning with transformation goals. I expect to see a beneficial state change following this move.",
