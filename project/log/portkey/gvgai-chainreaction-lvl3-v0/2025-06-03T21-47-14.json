The objective is to navigate a character through a maze-like layout while interacting with various sprites (game objects) and solving obstacles to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** The game features multiple sprite types including an avatar (the player character), boxes, boulders (with different properties and states), walls, holes, and goals.\n- **Interactions:** The interactions define how the sprites react when they collide or engage with each other. For example:\n  - The avatar can transform or move certain types of boulders.\n  - Boulders can change types based on interactions with other objects (like walls or the avatar).\n  - The avatar can manipulate boxes and boulders to achieve specific actions like bouncing or attracting gaze.\n- **Scoring System:** Players gain or lose points based on the interactions:\n  - Reaching the goal with specific boulders increases the score.\n  - Falling into holes or losing the avatar results in score loss.\n\n**Objectives:**  \n- The primary goal is to **eliminate all target boulders** (`targetBoulder`) while minimizing score loss by avoiding traps (holes) and other negative interactions.\n- Reach the designated exit or goal (`goal` sprite) while managing the position and type of boulders and boxes in the environment.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- Win:\n  - All target boulders are eliminated (counter reaches zero).\n- Loss:\n  - The avatar is removed from the screen (sprite limit reaches zero).\n  - The master boulder count reaches zero.\n  - The time limit (1500) is exceeded.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand the Layout:** Familiarize yourself with the map. Identify the locations of walls, holes, boulders, and boxes, as well as where the goal is located.\n\n2. **Use Boulders Wisely:** \n   - Start by manipulating boulders to reach the goal and remove any target boulders efficiently.\n   - Remember the types of boulders and their speed to control their movement strategically.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes:** Always be mindful of the holes on the map, as interacting with them will negatively impact your score. Keep your avatar from being near or interacting with these holes unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Maximize Score:** \n   - Prioritize actions that lead to higher score gains (e.g., moving certain boulders to the goal).\n   - Avoid actions that will lead to loss of the avatar or target boulders which may negatively affect your score. \n\n5. **Plan Forward:** Since there is a time limit, plan your moves carefully. Each action has consequences, so consider the chain reactions that can occur with each sprite interaction.\n\n6. **Experiment with Interactions:** Use trial and error with different boulders and boxes to discover optimal paths and strategies that may not be immediately clear from the rules alone.\n\nBy combining a strategic approach with an understanding of the layout and interactions, players can maximize their chances of successfully completing the game while managing scores effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> %\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> $\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> %\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> &\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> %\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> @\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> &\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the player's avatar (`a`) is located at row 8, column 2. The goal (`@`) is located at row 3, column 2, and there are normal boulders (`%`) at row 3, columns 3 and 8. The map also has some holes (`#`) at row 4, columns 9 and 11, and walls represented by `&`.\n\nGiven this setup, the logical first action to take is to move the avatar up, towards the row where the goal is located, even though there are normal boulders nearby. Since the avatar is on row 8, column 2, moving up to row 7, column 2 will bring the avatar closer to the goal. This is in line with the strategic goal of positioning the avatar to remove target boulders while avoiding traps.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nI've chosen to move up since it aligns perfectly with the strategy of getting closer to the goal while also avoiding immediate hazards like holes. I expect this move to maintain a strategic advantage as it sets up for future turns.",
