Game Genre and Feel:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a puzzle\u2013action game played on a grid or tile-based map. You wander through a maze-like level where you must pick up items, avoid (or defeat) roaming enemies, and head for a locked door.\n\u2003\u2022 The game mixes exploration with combat and puzzle-solving\u2014think of it as a mini adventure in a maze.\n\n2. Key Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement and Collisions: Your avatar moves around in a level filled with walls and obstacles. If you try to move into something solid (like a wall or a door when you\u2019re not ready), you\u2019ll simply be stopped (stepBack).\n\u2003\u2022 Collecting Items: One of the most important items is the key (an immovable sprite colored ORANGE). When your character (initially in a \u201cnokey\u201d state) touches the key, it transforms into the \u201cwithkey\u201d state. This is necessary to unlock the door.\n\u2003\u2022 Unlocking the Goal: The door (colored GREEN) represents your exit. If you approach the door while you\u2019re still in the \u201cnokey\u201d mode, the game won\u2019t let you pass (you\u2019ll be pushed back). Only when you have the key (i.e. your character is transformed to \u201cwithkey\u201d) does interacting with the door \u201ckill\u201d the goal sprite, signaling that you\u2019ve unlocked it.\n\u2003\u2022 Combat: You can shoot a sword (represented by a quick flickering sprite) with your avatar. Use it to defeat enemies. When the sword contacts an enemy, that enemy is eliminated and you pick up extra score. However, if your avatar bumps into an enemy without using the sword, you lose points (and possibly life, since the game loses when your avatar is removed).\n\u2003\u2022 Enemy Types: There are several enemy kinds (like fast bats, normal spiders, and slow scorpions) that move around randomly. They add pressure and must be dealt with either by avoidance or by striking them with the sword attack.\n\u2003\u2022 Other Obstacles: Walls and other immovable objects shape the level. Some enemy interactions (for instance, enemy colliding with enemy) simply result in one or both stepping back, keeping the chaos contained.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 Objective: Your overall goal is to collect the key, then reach the locked door (goal) with the key in your possession. Doing so \u201ckills\u201d the goal sprite (i.e. opens the door) and gives you a win.\n\u2003\u2022 Winning: The level ends in victory when the goal (door) has been removed\u2014signaling that you\u2019ve used the key on it.\n\u2003\u2022 Losing: The game ends if your avatar is killed (for example, by enemy contact without proper defense). This is tracked by a \u201cSpriteCounter\u201d for the avatar, meaning if you run out of lives or if your avatar is removed, you lose.\n\n4. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 First, explore your maze-like level to locate the key. Only with the key can you interact properly with the door. Avoid the door until you have this crucial item.\n\u2003\u2022 While making your way through the level, keep an eye on the roaming enemies. Use your sword (the special shooting attack) to take them out from a distance. This not only clears your path but can also boost your score.\n\u2003\u2022 Plan your route carefully. In addition to enemies, you have to navigate around walls and obstacles. It might be a good idea to temporarily avoid areas with too many enemies until you\u2019re better prepared.\n\u2003\u2022 Once you have the key (your character changes to \u201cwithkey\u201d), make your way to the door. Since the game won\u2019t let you use the door unless you have the key, your priorities become clear: collect the key, manage the threats, and then head to the exit.\n\u2003\u2022 Keep an eye on your score and movements\u2014dodging unnecessary enemy collisions is key, as direct contact with an enemy costs you points (and risks your avatar\u2019s life).\n\nIn summary, you\u2019re looking at a tactical maze puzzle with real-time action elements. Your best overall approach is to methodically navigate, collect the key to change your state, and then carefully clear a path to the door using your sword against hostile monsters. This balance of exploration, timing, and combat is what drives the challenge and enjoyment of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD \n\\Feedback: Action 4 did not alter the board state, meaning it failed to move withkey or adjust any element to progress toward the goal. Without any change and with a reward of 0.0, the move does not align with strategic objectives.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 'b'\nsword wall -> 's'\nsword withkey -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw...&ww.....w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw.w........%w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w..bw\nw....w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw.......w\nw..www..w\nw.......w\nw......&w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@bw%w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> b\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```**avatar strategy: Always mandate that withkey moves alter the board state by engaging a fresh floor goal cell that visibly repositions toward the door, thereby preventing null transitions** with **Alert**\n```\n\n```**door strategy: Prioritize direct door alignment by ensuring every action involving the withkey repositions it closer to door activation, eliminating no-op moves that fail to trigger progress** with **Alert**\n```\n\n```**sword strategy: Reserve sword interactions exclusively for instances where enemy presence impedes active floor goal transitions, ensuring that every engagement removes obstructions and results in a state change** with **Alert**\n```",
