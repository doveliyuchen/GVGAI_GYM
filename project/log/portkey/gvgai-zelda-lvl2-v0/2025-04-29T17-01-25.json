Game Genre and Overview:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a tile\u2010based arcade puzzle/action game with elements of exploration, enemy avoidance, and combat.  \n\u2003\u2022 The layout is a maze-like level with walls, floors, collectibles (key), hazards (multiple types of roaming monsters), and a final door (goal) that ends the level when activated correctly.\n\n2. Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement & Environment: You navigate an environment made up of walls and floors. Walls block movement, and there are obstacles that force you to find a safe path through the level.\n\u2003\u2022 Collectibles and Transformations: The level contains a key that you must pick up. When your avatar (initially in the \u201cnokey\u201d state) comes into contact with the key, you transform into the \u201cwithkey\u201d state. This change is crucial because only the \u201cwithkey\u201d version is allowed to interact with the door.\n\u2003\u2022 Door/Goal: The door (goal) won\u2019t let the \u201cnokey\u201d avatar pass\u2014it pushes you back if you try. Only when you have collected the key, interacting with the door will \u201ckill\u201d the goal, thus satisfying the win condition.\n\u2003\u2022 Enemies and Combat: There are various monsters (fast, normal, and slow) that roam the maze, moving randomly at different speeds. Though direct collision between the avatar and an enemy results in a penalty (and can potentially lead to loss if the avatar is removed), you also have an offensive option:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Your avatar has an ability to shoot a \u201csword\u201d projectile. When the sword hits an enemy, it destroys it and rewards points.  \n\u2003\u2022 Additional Interactions: Some collisions (like enemy/enemy or movable objects hitting walls) result in a simple \u201cstepBack\u201d effect, indicating the importance of positioning and timing.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 Objective: The main goal is to traverse the maze, collect the key (thus transforming your avatar to \u201cwithkey\u201d), and then reach the door to finish the level.\n\u2003\u2022 Win Condition: The level is won once you interact with the door using your \u201cwithkey\u201d avatar (the door sprite is removed, representing a successful exit).\n\u2003\u2022 Loss Condition: The game ends unfavorably if your avatar is removed (for example, by losing a collision with an enemy) or perhaps by depleting your score through penalties.\n\n4. Possible Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Begin by studying the level layout, and plan a path to the key while keeping an eye on enemy patrols.  \n\u2003\u2022 Avoid direct collisions with enemies; instead, use the sword projectile as a means of taking out enemies from a safe distance. Remember, while hitting enemies with the sword gives bonus points, directly running into them with your avatar incurs a penalty.\n\u2003\u2022 Once you pick up the key, ensure you convert your avatar (from \u201cnokey\u201d to \u201cwithkey\u201d). With the transformation complete, your priority shifts to reaching the door.\n\u2003\u2022 Plan your route toward the goal carefully, making use of walls and obstacles to shield yourself from roaming monsters.  \n\u2003\u2022 Maintain control of the engagement: if enemies block your path, use the sword to clear them before dashing to the door.  \n\u2003\u2022 Balance the risk and reward, since combat can help boost your score, but unnecessary collisions could cost you dearly.\n\nIn summary, your overall strategy should be to prioritize key collection and safe navigation, exploit the ranged sword attack for enemy control, and finally make a cautious but determined dash to the goal door once you are properly equipped. This measured approach helps you manage enemy threats and secure the win condition without unnecessary risk.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD\nFeedback: The action did not modify the game state, showing no progress toward the goal and not strategically aligned with objectives. It was ineffective, with no noticeable reduction in risk or advancement in position, leading to a neutral outcome with a reward of 0.0 from the environment\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw..&.ww....*w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w........%w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw...$w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...#...w\nw..www..w\nw......&w\nw$......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w%w.*w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> *\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```\n**avatar strategy: Leverage the sword\u2019s capacity to eliminate monsterQuick, monsterNormal, and monsterSlow hazards while activating floor key interactions to force transformation from nokey to withkey** with **Alert**\n**key strategy: Prioritize capturing the floor key within the open floor zone by first neutralizing nearby enemy threats with the sword to ensure a safe transformation path** with **Alert**\n**goal strategy: Upon transformation, advance toward the door by navigating through wall-protected floor corridors, and if enemy congestion persists, switch focus to targeted sword strikes to clear the way** with **Alert**\n```",
