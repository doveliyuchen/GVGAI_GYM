When the avatar touches the key, it transforms into \u201cwithkey\u201d (changing its appearance and possibly abilities), indicated by an increase in score.\n\u2003\u2013 Door (Goal) Interaction: With the key, the avatar can interact with the door (goal). When a \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite reaches the door, the door is \u201ckilled\u201d (essentially opened) and a point is scored. This interaction is the primary win trigger.\n\u2003\u2013 Combat: The avatar has a sword attack (suggested by the \u201csword\u201d sprite and \u201cShootAvatar\u201d action). This projectile can be used to defeat enemies, awarding extra score when an enemy is struck. However, enemy contact with the avatar (via direct collision) results in point loss or even avatar removal, leading to a loss.\n\u2003\u2013 Enemies: Several types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) roam the maze with random movement patterns. Their varying speeds and cooldowns make timing important when navigating near them.\n\u2003\u2013 Other Interactions: Some interactions (such as collision with immovable walls or the door without the key) cause the avatar to \u201cstepBack,\u201d essentially preventing progress in that direction.\n\n\u2022 Objective:\n\u2003\u2013 The primary goal is to safely navigate the maze, collect the key, and then reach the door with the key in hand.\n\u2003\u2013 Successfully opening the door (by having the \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite interact with the door) wins the level.\n\u2003\u2013 Additionally, you can increase your score by eliminating enemies with your sword attack.\n\n\u2022 Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Win: The game wins when the door (goal sprite) is \u201ckilled\u201d as a result of being touched by a \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite (meaning the correct key was collected and used).\n\u2003\u2013 Loss: If the \u201cavatar\u201d sprite is killed (for example, due to enemy collision), the level is lost.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Explore cautiously: Move through the maze while keeping an eye on enemy patterns. Avoid direct collisions with roaming enemies.\n\u20032. Secure the key: Your first major objective is to reach the key. Since collecting the key transforms your avatar to \u201cwithkey\u201d and increases your score, prioritize grabbing it early on.\n\u20033. Use your sword attack wisely: The avatar can shoot or swing a sword projectile to fend off enemies. Use your ranged attack to clear threats that block your path toward the key or door, but be mindful of timing so you don\u2019t get surrounded.\n\u20034. Take a safe route to the door: Once you have the key, the final goal is to reach the door. Plan your path to avoid enemy hotspots; you might need to decide between taking a longer, safer route or engaging enemies to clear a shortcut.\n\u20035. Manage risk: Balance offensive actions (attacking enemies for extra score) with defensive maneuvers (avoiding direct contact that could kill you) and plan your movements ahead.\n\u20036. Keep track of score: While winning the level is the main goal, eliminating enemies before they reach you boosts your score, so take advantage of your sword when safe.\n\nIn essence, success in the game depends on careful navigation, prudent combat against randomly moving monsters, and efficient path planning (key first, then door) while always staying alert to the dangers of enemy contact.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> &\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> $\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> m\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
