    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Seems like a top-down, single-screen puzzle game with some action elements, possibly a Roguelike-lite.\n\n**Objective:** To reach the `goal` (green door) with the `avatar` (player character).\n\n**Core Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** Implied movement of the `avatar` within the level.\n*   **Shooting:** The `avatar` can shoot `sword` projectiles.\n*   **Key Collection:** Collect a `key` to open the `goal`.\n*   **Enemy Avoidance/Combat:** Enemies (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`) roam the level and are dangerous.\n*   **Limited Sword Use**: The `sword` has a limit of 5, which might mean only 5 shots are available.\n*   **Transform:** Picking up the `key` transforms the `avatar`'s sprite.\n*   **Score**: Some events increase or decrease the score.\n\n**Win Condition:** All `goal` sprites are removed (presumably by reaching them).\n\n**Loss Condition:** All `avatar` sprites are removed (presumably by being killed by an enemy).\n\n**Sprite Types:**\n\n*   `floor`: Background.\n*   `goal`: The exit door. Requires a key to open.\n*   `key`: Collect this to open the door.\n*   `sword`: Projectile fired by the avatar.\n*   `avatar`: The player character.\n*   `nokey`: Avatar sprite without a key.\n*   `withkey`: Avatar sprite with a key.\n*   `enemy`: A generic enemy.\n*   `monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`: Specific enemy types with different movement speeds (indicated by `cooldown`).\n*   `wall`: Obstacles.\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Walls.\n*   `.`: Empty floor space.\n*   `A`: Starting position of the `avatar`.\n*   `g`: Location of the `goal`.\n*   `+`: Location of the `key`.\n*   `1`, `2`, `3`: Locations of different enemy types (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`).\n\n**Interactions Breakdown:**\n\n*   `movable wall > stepBack`:  Implies there might be movable wall sprites, and pushing them into a wall prevents movement.\n*   `nokey goal > stepBack`: You can't enter the `goal` without a key.\n*   `goal withkey > killSprite scoreChange=1`: Entering the `goal` with a key removes the `goal` sprite and awards a point.\n*   `enemy sword > killSprite scoreChange=2`: Shooting an enemy with a `sword` kills the enemy and gives you 2 points.\n*   `enemy enemy > stepBack`: Enemies cannot occupy the same space.\n*   `avatar enemy > killSprite scoreChange=-1`: Touching an enemy kills the `avatar` and penalizes you one point.\n*   `nokey key > transformTo stype=withkey scoreChange=1 killSecond=True`: Picking up the `key` transforms the `avatar` into the `withkey` sprite, scores a point and removes the `key` sprite.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key First:** Immediately prioritize collecting the `key`.\n2.  **Enemy Avoidance/Kiting:** Carefully navigate around the enemies, using the walls to your advantage. The enemies have different speeds, so understanding their movement patterns is crucial.\n3.  **Strategic Sword Use:** Conserve your limited `sword` projectiles. Use them to clear paths or eliminate particularly troublesome enemies. Prioritize shooting enemies since it yields the most points.\n4.  **Safe Path to Goal:** Once you have the key, plan a safe route to the `goal`, avoiding unnecessary enemy encounters.\n5.  **Maximize Score:** If possible, take calculated risks to eliminate enemies with the `sword` to increase your score, but avoid dying.\n\nIn summary, the game seems to be a strategic puzzle where you must balance key collection, enemy avoidance, resource management (swords), and path planning to reach the goal. Dying removes you from the game, so the number one priority is to keep your character alive!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
