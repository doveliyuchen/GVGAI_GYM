Players navigate a map, collect items, and engage in combat with enemies. The game also incorporates a top-down or isometric perspective based on the sprite representations.\n\n**2. Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Various sprites represent walls, floors, keys, doors, enemies, and the player avatar.\n- **Movement:** The player navigates through the level, interacting with different sprites.\n- **Combat:** Players can engage with enemies using a sword, and combat mechanics involve the player scoring points by defeating enemies.\n- **Item Collection:** Keys are essential for accessing the goal (the door), with transformations taking place when the key is collected.\n- **Level Boundaries:** Movable walls induce a step-back mechanic, adding a challenge to navigation.\n  \n**3. Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the \"goal\" sprite (the green door) by collecting a \"key\" sprite and defeating enemies. Points are accumulated by achieving goals and defeating enemies.\n\n**4. Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if the player reaches the goal with the key.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (likely by an enemy).\n\n**5. Overall Strategy:**\n- **Explore the Map:** Start by familiarizing yourself with the layout. Avoid confrontation initially to understand enemy patterns.\n- **Gather Keys:** Your priority should be to collect the key ('key' sprite) as it is required to open the goal ('goal' sprite).\n- **Engage Enemies Wisely:** Use the sword to defeat enemies only when necessary, as you lose points if the avatar is defeated. Try to take out weaker enemies first to gain confidence and score.\n- **Utilize Obstacles:** Use immovable walls to your advantage during encounters, blocking enemy paths when possible.\n- **Plan Your Route:** After collecting the key, plan a route to the goal that minimizes enemy encounters and obstacles, setting you up for a successful escape.\n\nBy following these guidelines, players can maximize their chances of success while navigating the game's challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nsword -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> &\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> $\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The closest enemy to the avatar is a quick monster (represented by '%') at (2, 7).\n\nGiven the objective is to collect the key and reach the goal, the immediate priority is to navigate toward the key without confrontations. The last position of the avatar is not mentioned; however, considering it hasn't moved, I will focus on the strategic pathway as indicated by existing sprites encountered.\n\nTo minimize risk while aiming to collect the key at (4, 1), I should first move in the direction of the key. Assuming I start at a position where I can either go down toward row 4 and then left toward column 1, I will:\n\nAction: ``` Action: 4 ``` (which means moving Down) \n\nThis action is based on the strategy of moving toward the key while assessing enemy movement patterns, with the expectation of approaching the key and exploring available further actions towards the goal without immediate danger.",
