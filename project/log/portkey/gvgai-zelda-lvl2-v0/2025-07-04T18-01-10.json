    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Seems like a top-down, single-screen puzzle/action game, possibly with roguelike elements due to the presence of enemies and item collection (key).\n\n**Objective:** Reach the goal (green door) to win.\n\n**Sprites and Their Roles:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The player character. Can shoot \"swords.\" Starts as \"nokey\" (no key).\n*   **Goal:** The exit. Requires a key to open.\n*   **Key:** Collect to transform the avatar into \"withkey,\" allowing opening the goal.\n*   **Sword:**  A projectile fired by the avatar. Has limited uses.\n*   **Enemy:** Various monsters with different speeds and \"cons\" (likely contact damage).\n*   **Wall:** Impassable obstacles.\n*   **Floor:** Background tile.\n*   **Movable:** A type of block that the avatar may be able to push?\n*   **nokey:** Avatar sprite when not holding a key.\n*   **withkey:** Avatar sprite when holding a key.\n*   **monsterQuick, monsterNormal, monsterSlow:** different types of enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** Implied top-down movement.\n*   **Shooting:** The avatar can shoot swords.\n*   **Key Collection:** Collecting the key changes the avatar's state.\n*   **Enemy AI:** Enemies move randomly.\n*   **Limited Swords:** player has a limit to how many swords they can shoot (limit=5).\n*   **Autotiling:** Walls automatically connect visually.\n*   **StepBack:** When the avatar fails to move where it is trying to (due to a wall or closed door), the avatar will move to its previous position.\n\n**Win Condition:** Destroy all sprites of type \"goal\" (reach the goal).\n\n**Loss Condition:** Lose all sprites of type \"avatar\" (the player character dies, likely by colliding with an enemy).\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n*   Reaching the goal: +1\n*   Killing an enemy with a sword: +2\n*   Picking up a key: +1\n*   Dying to an enemy: -1\n\n**Level Layout Interpretation:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `.`: Floor\n*   `+`: Key\n*   `g`: Goal\n*   `A`: Avatar (starting position)\n*   `1`: monsterQuick\n*   `2`: monsterNormal\n*   `3`: monsterSlow\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Collection:** Get the key as quickly and safely as possible.\n2.  **Conserve Swords:**  Use swords strategically to clear paths or deal with immediate threats. Don't waste them.\n3.  **Enemy Avoidance/Engagement:** Try to avoid enemies if possible, especially early on.  Use swords to take them out if necessary, or maneuver them into paths that don't block your way.\n4.  **Plan Your Route:** Look at the level layout to figure out the most efficient path to the key and then to the goal.\n5.  **Be Careful Near Walls:** Due to autotiling and the close quarters, the walls are likely to cause navigation issues.\n\n**In essence:** A puzzle-action game where you need to collect a key, manage limited resources (swords), avoid or defeat enemies, and reach the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nkey monsterQuick -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> $\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> &\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
