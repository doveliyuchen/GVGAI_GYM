Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n\u2022 Genre and Feel:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s like a maze or dungeon puzzle with action elements\u2014a bit like classic top\u2010down adventure games.\n\u2003\u2013 You'll be both solving navigation puzzles (finding your way around walls and through corridors) and dealing with moving enemies.\n\n\u2022 Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Movement: You control an avatar that can move around the maze. The floor tiles give you the playable area, while walls are obstacles you can\u2019t pass through.\n\u2003\u2013 Key and Door: There\u2019s a key (displayed as an orange icon) lying in the level. When your avatar (shown as \u201cnokey\u201d initially) touches the key it transforms into \u201cwithkey\u201d (often depicted differently), awarding you extra points. Only when you have the key can you successfully interact with the door (the goal) to finish the level.\n\u2003\u2013 Combat: Your avatar is armed with a sword that can be \u201cfired\u201d (it acts as a projectile with limited uses). Using the sword, you can kill enemy sprites for bonus points. However, colliding directly with enemies as your avatar causes negative points and may lead to your death.\n\u2003\u2013 Enemies: There are several enemy types (including faster and slower variants like bats, spiders, scorpions, etc.) that move around randomly and add urgency and danger to your navigation.\n\n\u2022 Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 The main goal is to reach and interact with the door (goal sprite). However, the door only \u201copens\u201d (or the action is allowed) when you have the key (you\u2019ve transformed your avatar into the \u201cwithkey\u201d version).\n\u2003\u2013 If you manage to clear the door (thus causing the goal to be \u201ckilled\u201d by the interaction), you win.\n\u2003\u2013 If your avatar is removed (for example, by colliding with an enemy the wrong way), you lose.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Explore the level carefully to locate the key first. Since the door won\u2019t work unless you have the key, avoid trying to force your way to the door too early.\n\u20032. Plan your path considering the maze-like layout and the placement of walls. Look for safe corridors that let you sidestep roaming enemies.\n\u20033. Use your sword wisely. Since you have a limited number of sword \u201cshots,\u201d save them for when enemies are in your way rather than colliding with them directly.\n\u20034. Be cautious around the various enemy types. Given their movement speeds and random paths, timing is key: wait for opportunities where you can safely approach the key and then the door.\n\u20035. Score management: You\u2019ll score points by collecting the key, defeating enemies with your sword, and by triggering interactions at the right time. Avoid unnecessary confrontations that could cost you points or lead to your loss.\n\u20036. Stay aware of your surroundings\u2014sometimes enemy movements or blocked paths might force you to rethink your approach. A careful, step-by-step navigation is usually best.\n\nIn summary, the winning approach is to scout a safe route, secure the key first, use your sword to neutralize any enemies that threaten you, and finally head for the door to complete the level. Enjoy blending careful puzzle planning with active combat!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> %\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> m\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
