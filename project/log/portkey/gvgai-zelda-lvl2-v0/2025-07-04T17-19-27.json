Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on:\n\n\u2022 Genre & Setting:\n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a maze/puzzle game where you navigate a confined area (the level grid is bordered by walls) filled with obstacles, keys, doors, and roaming monsters.\n\u2003\u2013 The visual style is tile\u2010based, using different sprites for floors, walls, keys, doors, and various enemies.\n\n\u2022 Core Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2013 Movement happens on a grid. You control an \u201cavatar\u201d that can also shoot a sword (an action indicated by an \u201cOrientedFlicker\u201d sprite).\n\u2003\u2013 The game makes you collect items: there\u2019s a key (orange) that you must pick up. Touching the key with your avatar (initially in the \u201cnokey\u201d state) transforms you into \u201cwithkey,\u201d which is crucial for advancing.\n\u2003\u2013 The door (green and marked as \u201cgoal\u201d) won\u2019t recognize you until you\u2019ve collected the key. When your \u201cwithkey\u201d avatar interacts with the door, the door sprite is removed, signaling a win.\n\u2003\u2013 There are walls (immovable barriers) that restrict your movement, as well as \u201cmovable\u201d sprites which might be objects influenced by your actions.\n\n\u2022 Enemies & Combat:\n\u2003\u2013 Several enemy types (including monsterQuick, monsterNormal, and monsterSlow) patrol the maze via random movement (NPC behavior with different cooldown times).\n\u2003\u2013 You handle enemies in several ways. If you strike an enemy with your sword, the enemy is killed nicely (for extra score). But if you run into an enemy with your avatar directly (without using the sword), you still kill it but incur a score penalty.\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s an interesting interaction where even colliding with enemies makes them \u201cstep back\u201d in some cases (or be transformed), which adds a layer of strategy in timing your attacks or dodges.\n\n\u2022 Objectives & Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2013 Your objective is to pick up the key, transform your character from \u201cnokey\u201d into \u201cwithkey,\u201d and then reach the door (goal). Activating the door wins the game.\n\u2003\u2013 You lose if your avatar is eliminated. In other words, if you run out of \u201cavatar\u201d lives, the game ends in defeat.\n\n\u2022 Overall Strategy:\n\u20031. Navigate the maze carefully. Before the path to the door becomes accessible, you need to locate the key. Plan a route that minimizes unnecessary encounters with roaming enemies.\n\u20032. Use your sword to take out enemies from a safe distance. Avoid direct collisions with enemies unless necessary, as doing so costs you points.\n\u20033. Once you have the key (i.e. once your avatar transforms to \u201cwithkey\u201d), focus on reaching the door. This is your win condition, so make sure to time your movements when enemy patrols are at a distance.\n\u20034. Remain mindful of the maze layout. Use walls and obstacles to help shield you from random enemies, and anticipate their movement patterns based on the different speeds (quick, normal, slow).\n\u20035. Balance combat and puzzle solving. While eliminating dangerous foes can clear your path, sometimes avoiding them might keep your score and avatar\u2019s safety in check.\n\nIn simple terms: Get the key, fight or dodge enemies using your sword wisely, and then rush to the door to exit the maze. Focus on planning your route and timing your maneuvers to deal with both the maze and its roaming adversaries.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> &\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> $\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> m\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
