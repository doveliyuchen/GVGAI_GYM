The presence of an avatar, monsters, keys, and goals indicates an emphasis on exploration, combat, puzzle-solving, and finding items.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** Different types of sprites represent different objects (e.g., walls, enemies, goals). The avatar can shoot with a sword, defeat enemies, and interact with other sprites.\n- **Movement/Combat:** The avatar can move and engage in combat with enemies using a sword. The avatar's status changes based on interactions (e.g., transforming into 'withkey' when collecting the key).\n- **Interactions:** The player can encounter various sprites and perform specific actions. For example, collecting a key allows access to the goal, while encountering enemies can lead to combat with potential score implications.\n- **Scoring:** The player gains points for reaching the 'goal' with a key (1 point) and defeating enemies (2 points), but loses points upon being defeated by an enemy (-1 point).\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The main objective is to reach the 'goal' after obtaining a 'key'.\n- Collecting the 'key' allows interaction with the 'goal' to win the game.\n- Players need to navigate the environment, avoiding or defeating enemies along the way.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the avatar reaches the 'goal' while holding the 'key' (tracked by the sprite counter for 'goal').\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is defeated by an enemy (tracked by the sprite counter for 'avatar').\n\n### Level Layout\nThe level layout consists of walls (represented as 'w'), spaces for movement (represented as '.'), several enemies/nodes, and a mix of goals and keys. \n- The avatar starts at 'A', and there are multiple paths to navigate toward the 'goal' (represented as 'g'), with some spaces containing keys (numbers indicate the key locations) and enemies (marked by '1', '2', and '3') along the way.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Identify:** Familiarize yourself with the layout, taking note of enemy positions and the locations of the key and goal.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Collecting the Key:** Navigate towards the 'key' first, avoiding enemies whenever possible. Collect the key promptly to facilitate access to the goal.\n\n3. **Combat Tactics:** If forced to engage with enemies, use strategic positioning to your advantage:\n   - Stay mobile to evade attacks.\n   - Attack enemies while maintaining a safe distance if possible.\n\n4. **Plan Move Sequences:** Think ahead about the moves to take. Keep track of your health/status to avoid unnecessary confrontations that could result in defeat.\n\n5. **Use Knowledge of Sprite Interactions:** Understand all interaction rules. For instance, if you don\u2019t have the key and go to the goal, you will be pushed back, so there\u2019s no benefit in rushing.\n\n6. **Manage Resources:** Be mindful of your encounters with enemies; defeat them when necessary, especially when they pose a direct threat, but ideally avoid fights to maintain your avatar\u2019s lifetime (and thus your score).\n\n7. **Target the Goal after Key Collection:** Once the key is in your possession, navigate safely to the goal to win the game while maximizing score.\n\nBy adhering to this strategy, you can efficiently navigate through the game, maintain your avatar's status, and achieve the goal successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nkey monsterNormal -> 'm'\nsword wall -> 'n'\nkey monsterQuick -> 'b'\nnokey sword -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> *\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> n\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> %\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
