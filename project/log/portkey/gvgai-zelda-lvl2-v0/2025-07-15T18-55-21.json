    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nOkay, let's break down this game.\n\n**Genre:** Seems like a top-down, single-player, tile-based puzzle game with combat elements. It has a classic adventure/roguelike feel.\n\n**Objective:** The player's objective is to reach the green `goal` door.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** The player controls an `avatar` and can move around the level.\n*   **Shooting:** The avatar can shoot `sword` projectiles.\n*   **Key/Door:** The player needs to find a `key` to open the `goal` door. Picking up the key transforms the avatar's sprite.\n*   **Enemies:** There are `enemy` sprites which the avatar must avoid or defeat.\n*   **Combat:** The player can use their sword to kill enemies.\n*   **Obstacles:** Walls (`wall`) are impassable, and it seems some `movable` objects exist.\n*   **Score:** Score can be increased by killing enemies or picking up the key.\n\n**Win Condition:** Destroying all `goal` sprites. (Reaching the door with the key)\n\n**Loss Condition:** Avatar gets destroyed. (Likely by an enemy)\n\n**Sprite Meanings:**\n\n*   `floor`: The ground.\n*   `goal`: The exit door.\n*   `key`: Item required to open the door.\n*   `sword`: The projectile the avatar shoots.\n*   `avatar`: The player character.\n*   `nokey`: Avatar without the key.\n*   `withkey`: Avatar holding the key.\n*   `enemy`: Generic enemy type.\n*   `monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`: Different types of enemies with varying speed.\n*   `wall`: Impassable barrier.\n\n**Level Layout Decoding:**\n\n*   `w`: Wall\n*   `.`: Floor\n*   `+`: Key\n*   `A`: Avatar (Starting position)\n*   `g`: Goal\n*   `1`, `2`, `3`: Probably monster spawn locations with varying difficulties (3 is likely Quick, 2 Normal and 1 Slow).\n\n**Overall Strategy Suggestion:**\n\n1.  **Key First:** Prioritize finding the `key` (`+`). It's essential to open the `goal`.\n2.  **Enemy Awareness:** Be mindful of the enemy movement patterns. Bait them into favorable positions for easier kills.\n3.  **Conserve Swords:** Swords seem to be limited, so use them wisely. Think about kiting enemies to defeat them when they are in favorable positions.\n4.  **Path Planning:** Plan your route carefully to avoid unnecessary enemy encounters and maximize efficiency. Remember that enemies can probably only travel on floor spaces.\n5.  **Risk Management:** Given the negative score for being killed by an enemy, prioritize survival. It might be better to avoid an enemy encounter than risk a negative score.\n6.  **Abuse AI**: Given that the enemies have different cooldowns, try to exploit this by moving away when they are about to attack.\n7.  **Prioritize the goal**: The goal is your first and foremost mission. The enemies, keys and walls are obstacles in the way of this mission.\n\nIn essence, this is a game of careful navigation, puzzle-solving (finding the key), and tactical combat, all wrapped in a classic roguelike aesthetic.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> $\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
