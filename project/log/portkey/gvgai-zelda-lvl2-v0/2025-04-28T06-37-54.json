Game Genre\n\n\u2022 Action\u2013Puzzle / Maze Adventure  \n\u2003\u2013 The game is played on a grid\u2010 or tile\u2013based level (note the level layout with walls, floors, doors, keys, etc.).  \n\u2003\u2013 It combines real\u2013time movement and combat (with the \u201csword\u201d mechanic and various enemy NPCs) with puzzle elements (navigating a maze, collecting a key, and unlocking a door).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. Mechanics\n\n\u2022 Sprite Types and Their Roles  \n\u2003\u2013 Floor: Background element (hidden and decorative).  \n\u2003\u2013 Wall: Immovable and autotiled barriers, forming the maze\u2019s structure.  \n\u2003\u2013 Avatar: The player\u2013controlled character (in this case, represented by an \u201cA\u201d in the layout) that can shoot a \u201csword\u201d (an oriented flicker sprite used as an attack mechanism).  \n\u2003\u2013 Nokey and Withkey: Two states for the player character. Initially, the avatar likely acts as \u201cnokey\u201d and, upon interacting with a key, transforms into \u201cwithkey\u201d (via the interaction \u201cnokey key > transformTo stype=withkey\u201d).  \n\u2003\u2013 Key: An immovable object (colored orange) that, when touched by a \u201cnokey\u201d sprite, transforms it into one that carries the key (\u201cwithkey\u201d).  \n\u2003\u2013 Goal: Represented by a green door; interacting with it while possessing the key (i.e. the sprite \u201cwithkey\u201d) triggers the door\u2019s removal (\u201cgoal withkey > killSprite\u201d) and a score gain.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sword: A short\u2013lived attack sprite which \u201cshoots\u201d from the avatar and can kill enemies.  \n\u2003\u2013 Enemy: Several types of enemies (monsterQuick, monsterNormal, monsterSlow) move randomly with varying cooldowns and \u201ccons\u201d (a possible measure of their speed or persistence).  \n\u2003\u2013 Movable: Likely represents objects that can be pushed around (though only one interaction is defined with wall objects).\n\n\u2022 Interactions  \n\u2003\u2013 Physical contact with certain objects can push the player/colliding sprite back (\u201cstepBack\u201d), enforcing movement restrictions (e.g., trying to push through walls or a locked door without the key).  \n\u2003\u2013 Collecting the key automatically transforms a \u201cnokey\u201d sprite to \u201cwithkey\u201d, adding to the score.  \n\u2003\u2013 When a \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite touches the goal, the door \u201cdies\u201d (is removed) and the player gains score.  \n\u2003\u2013 The sword can be used against enemies (each enemy killed by the sword increases score by 2).  \n\u2003\u2013 In direct collision with an enemy, the avatar suffers by having the enemy killed but at the expense of a score penalty (\u20131).\n\n\u2022 Level Layout  \n\u2003\u2013 A bordered maze made of walls with open spaces, scattered with various symbols.  \n\u2003\u2013 \u201cA\u201d most likely represents the avatar\u2019s starting position.  \n\u2003\u2013 Numbers (such as \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d) are traditionally used in these systems to denote different enemy types (monsterSlow, monsterNormal, monsterQuick, etc.) or possibly other interactive elements.  \n\u2003\u2013 The \u201c+\u201d might denote the key\u2019s location, and \u201cg\u201d is likely the goal (the green door).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. Objective\n\n\u2022 Primary Goal  \n\u2003\u2013 The player must navigate the maze, avoid or manage enemies, collect the key (transforming the avatar from \u201cnokey\u201d to \u201cwithkey\u201d), and then reach (and interact with) the goal (the door).\n\n\u2022 Score Incentives  \n\u2003\u2013 Collecting key and then unlocking the door increases the score (each awarding +1).  \n\u2003\u2013 Killing enemies with the sword provides additional points (+2 per enemy), while colliding directly with an enemy results in a penalty (\u20131).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n4. Win/Loss Conditions\n\n\u2022 Winning  \n\u2003\u2013 The termination condition \u201cSpriteCounter stype=goal win=True\u201d indicates that if the goal sprite is removed (killed via interaction with a \u201cwithkey\u201d sprite) then the player wins. In effect, successfully reaching the goal with the key ends the level in victory.\n\n\u2022 Losing  \n\u2003\u2013 The termination condition \u201cSpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False\u201d means that if the player\u2019s avatar is eliminated (e.g., through enemy collisions or possibly other hazards), the game is lost. Moves/actions that result in the avatar\u2019s removal or death thus lead to loss.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n5. Overall Strategy\n\n\u2022 Route Planning and Timing  \n\u2003\u2013 Study the maze layout to determine the optimal path from your starting point to the key, and then from the key to the goal.  \n\u2003\u2013 Time your movements to avoid encounters with the roaming enemies, especially the faster ones (monsterQuick).\n\n\u2022 Key Collection  \n\u2003\u2013 Make the collection of the key a priority early in the level since unlocking and winning depend on transforming your state to \u201cwithkey\u201d.  \n\u2003\u2013 Avoid unnecessary combat when collecting the key; if timed properly, you can slip past enemy patrols.\n\n\u2022 Combat Tactics  \n\u2003\u2013 Use the sword attack judiciously to clear enemies that block your optimal path. The sword has a limit on its striking ability (\u201climit=5\u201d) and a set frame rate (frameRate=8), so learn its timing and effective range.  \n\u2003\u2013 Remember that while using the sword gives a scoring bonus, colliding with enemies directly will penalize you.  \n\n\u2022 Avoiding Hazards  \n\u2003\u2013 Follow the \u201cstepBack\u201d interactions: if you run into walls or try to engage the locked door without the key, you\u2019ll be pushed back, so understand these boundaries to plan your moves.  \n\u2003\u2013 Manage your encounters with enemies; sometimes it\u2019s better to dodge rather than attack, especially if you\u2019re not in possession of the key yet.\n\n\u2022 Score Maximization  \n\u2003\u2013 In addition to simply reaching the goal, you can improve your score by eliminating enemies with your sword when the opportunity arises, but balance this with the need to avoid damage.\n  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nSummary\n\nThe game is a maze-based action puzzle in which you must navigate a level filled with walls and roaming enemies. Your objective is to first collect the key (transforming your character to \u201cwithkey\u201d), then reach and \u201cunlock\u201d the door (goal) to win. Along the way, you can use your sword to eliminate enemies and earn extra points, but be careful: direct contact with enemies without using your weapon results in a score penalty and could eventually lead to your avatar\u2019s death. The overall strategy is to carefully plan your route and timings, secure the key early, and cautiously engage or avoid enemies on your way to the goal.\n\nThis analysis should help in understanding the game\u2019s design, objectives, and how to approach playing it effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw..&.ww....*w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w........%w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw...$w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...#...w\nw..www..w\nw......&w\nw$......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w%w.*w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.",
