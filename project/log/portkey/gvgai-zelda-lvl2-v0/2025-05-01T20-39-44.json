Game Genre and Feel:\n\u2003\u2022 It\u2019s a top\u2010down puzzle\u2013action arcade game. You control an avatar that moves around a gridlike level, solving puzzles (like collecting keys and reaching doors) while dodging or fighting enemies.\n\u2003\u2022 The game mixes elements of strategy (planning your route, managing keys and power-ups) with action (avoiding or eliminating roaming enemies).\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n\u2003\u2022 Movement & Environment: Your avatar navigates a level laid out with walls, floors, and other obstacles. Some objects (like walls) can block your path, and certain tiles \u201cstep back\u201d when you try to go in, meaning you\u2019re prevented from entering those spaces.\n\u2003\u2022 Items and Power-ups:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s a key (orange colored) that you need to collect. When the character \u201cnokey\u201d interacts with the key, they transform into \u201cwithkey,\u201d which is required to interact successfully with the door (goal).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The door (goal) is green and represents the exit once you\u2019re prepared.\n\u2003\u2022 Combat: You have a sword that can likely be \u201cshot\u201d (as indicated by ShootAvatar with a sword), and you can use it to eliminate enemies on contact. There\u2019s a limit (5) on the sword\u2019s use each time, so you may need to use it carefully.\n\u2003\u2022 Enemies: There are multiple enemy types (monsterQuick, monsterNormal, and monsterSlow) that roam randomly at different speeds (using a \u201ccooldown\u201d mechanic). Directly touching an enemy as your avatar causes a negative score and might be dangerous.\n\u2003\u2022 Interactions: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If \u201cnokey\u201d (your character without a key) touches the key, it transforms into \u201cwithkey\u201d and gives you a score bump.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Approaching the door (goal) while \u201cwithkey\u201d eliminates the door sprite (representing level completion) and gives you further score points.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When your sword hits generic enemies, it also adds to your score.\n\n3. Objective and Win/Loss Conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 The overall objective is to safely navigate the level, pick up the key (transmuting your character from \u201cnokey\u201d to \u201cwithkey\u201d), and then reach the door (goal) to complete the level.\n\u2003\u2022 Win Condition: Eliminate or \u201cclear\u201d the goal sprite from the level (using it while having the key).\n\u2003\u2022 Loss Condition: If your avatar is killed (contact with enemy that negatively impacts your score or results in elimination), you lose.\n\n4. Overall Strategy:\n\u2003\u2022 Plan Your Route: Look over the level layout and decide on a path that minimizes exposure to roving enemies while still allowing you to grab the key first. \n\u2003\u2022 Key First: Focus on collecting the key to transform into \u201cwithkey\u201d\u2014only then will you be able to properly interact with the door.\n\u2003\u2022 Manage Combat: Use your sword carefully. When enemies are in your path, aim to shoot your sword at them, but keep in mind the sword\u2019s limited uses (only 5 flickers at a time). Avoid direct contact with enemies as your avatar, which can reduce your score or cause you to lose.\n\u2003\u2022 Avoid Unnecessary Clashes: Not all enemy encounters require combat. Sometimes it may be better to step back and let the enemy move away, preserving your sword\u2019s limited power and keeping your avatar safe.\n\u2003\u2022 Timing: Since some enemies move faster than others, timing your moves to avoid them as you approach the key and the door is crucial.\n\nIn summary, you'll be playing a strategic and reflex-driven game where careful movement, timely combat, and proper sequencing (getting the key before the exit) are essential to winning. Enjoy planning your path, managing your encounters, and watching your score climb as you successfully navigate through each level!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD \nFeedback: Action (4) produced no observable change in the game state\u2014none of the critical elements were repositioned to advance the goal or reduce danger. Without any progress toward the objective, the move offers no strategic value and yields a reward of 0.0 from the environment\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nwithkey -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw&...ww.....w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw.w.....%...w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w..mw\nw....w.$..w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw......&w\nw..www..w\nw.......w\nw.......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw$.w....w\nw.ww%w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@mw.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> &\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> m\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> $\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```\n**avatar strategy: Revise compound repositioning to actively drive withkey into the door's impact corridor, ensuring every move meaningfully reduces risk from static obstacles and enemy interference** with **Alert**\n**withkey strategy: Shift from inert moves to deliberate compound progress that funnels the withkey avatar into a safe engagement zone with the door, converting each shift into potential door activation** with **Alert**\n**goal strategy: Transform the door from a passive objective into an actionable target by channeling withkey into its effective range, thereby triggering the critical killSprite interaction for level completion** with **Alert**\n**sword strategy: Conserve sword usage and deploy it solely when proximate enemy obstacles threaten the compound progression toward the door, ensuring combat actions actively clear the path** with **Alert**\n```",
