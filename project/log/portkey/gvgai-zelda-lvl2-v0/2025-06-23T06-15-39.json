Players navigate an environment filled with platforms, walls, keys, and enemies, focusing on collecting items and reaching specific goals. \n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites (Entities)**:\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character, represented by a 'swordman' who can shoot (using a sword).\n  - **Goals**: \n    - **With Key**: A door that can be opened only if the player has collected an orange key.\n    - **Without Key**: The door cannot be passed unless the player has the key.\n  - **Key**: An item that the player can collect to unlock the goal.\n  - **Enemies**: Various types (quick, normal, slow) that can damage the player or be defeated using the sword.\n  - **Walls**: Act as barriers that cannot be moved through. \n  - **Movable walls** may have interactions that push players back.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The player can interact with the key to change their state from 'nokey' to 'withkey'.\n  - Enemies can be defeated, gaining the player points.\n  - If the player (avatar) comes into contact with an enemy, they lose points and may be defeated.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to collect the key and reach the door (goal) to score points and advance in the game. The game ends successfully when the player touches the goal with the key.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning**: The player wins the game when all goal sprites are counted as interacted with after successfully using the key.\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy before achieving their goals.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Explore and Collect**: Begin by exploring the level to understand where the key is located. Prioritize collecting the key early, as it is necessary for reaching the goal.\n\n2. **Avoiding Enemies**: Learn the enemy patterns (quick, normal, slow) as you navigate through the level. It may be wise to avoid combat unless necessary to conserve health and points. Strategically use the sword to defeat enemies but be careful to dodge their attacks.\n\n3. **Use of Movable Walls**: If applicable, interact with movable walls wisely to navigate the level. If you are pushed back, assess your surroundings to find alternative paths.\n\n4. **Timing and Positioning**: Since enemies have different cooldowns, time your movements to either attack them or avoid them as necessary. Position yourself strategically to gain the upper hand during encounters.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route**: Develop a route that allows you to effectively transition between collecting the key, avoiding enemies, and reaching the door without unnecessary detours.\n\n6. **Score Management**: Focus on defeating enemies to maximize your score, as this may be important depending on game mechanics or level progression.\n\nBy executing these strategies, you can effectively navigate the challenges of the game and work towards a satisfying victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nkey monsterNormal -> 'm'\nsword -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> &\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> $\nrow=4, col=6 -> *\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> k\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To determine the correct action, let's analyze the state of the game based on the provided map and the current rules:\n\n1. **Avatar's Position**: The avatar (swordman) is not specified directly, but we should assume it is located at an accessible area. Given the layout, the avatar might currently be on the floor (the grid represented with '.') or near walls ('w').\n\n2. **Key and Goal**:\n   - The key (#) is located at (4,1).\n   - The goal (@) is located at (7,11).\n   - The accessible area has fewer enemies to encounter as you approach.\n\n3. **Enemies**:\n   - There are one quick enemy '%' at (1,9) and one normal enemy '$' at (4,5) along with a 'key monsterNormal' which might present a threat if approached carelessly.\n\n4. **Immediate Goal**: \n   - To win the game, I need to collect the key and then reach the goal door. It is essential to assess the nearest path to the key first.\n\n### Suggested Plan:\n- Start moving towards the key located at (4,1).\n  \nSince I would typically need to verify if my current position allows me to aim towards the key and plan my movements accordingly, if I were starting and situated above the goal, I would choose to move towards the key directly if there are no obstacles obstructing it.\n\nLet\u2019s assume I\u2019m starting from (4,2), I would proceed as follows:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\n**Feedback**: The action is to move left toward the key. I expect this will bring me closer to collecting the key while avoiding immediate threats.",
