There's a clear goal state (reaching the door).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Movement:** You control an avatar (`nokey` or `withkey`). Standard movement is implied.\n*   **Shooting:** The avatar shoots using a \"sword\" sprite. The `ShootAvatar` indicates shooting direction.\n*   **Enemy AI:** Enemies (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`) move randomly.  Their 'cooldown' value likely controls how often they move. Higher cooldown = slower movement.\n*   **Limited Weapon:** The `sword` has a limited number of uses (limit=5) and likely disappears after being used.\n*   **Key/Door:**  You need a key to open the door (`goal`).\n*   **Transformations:** Picking up a key transforms the avatar from `nokey` to `withkey`.\n*   **Immovable:** Some objects are stuck and you cannot move them.\n\n**Objective:** Reach the green door (`goal`) as the avatar (`withkey`). To do this, you must first collect the key (`key`).\n\n**Win Condition:** All goal sprites are removed (`SpriteCounter stype=goal win=True`). This likely means you just need to reach one goal sprite in a level to win.\n\n**Loss Condition:** All avatar sprites are removed (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False`).  This happens when the avatar is killed by an enemy.\n\n**Key Observations from Level Layout:**\n\n*   `w`: Walls.\n*   `.`: Empty space/floor.\n*   `A`: Starting position of the avatar (`nokey`).\n*   `g`: Goal (door).\n*   `+`: Key.\n*   `1`, `2`, `3`: Probably represent different enemy types. Based on the sprite definitions, '1' is `monsterQuick`, '2' is `monsterNormal`, and '3' is `monsterSlow`.\n\n**Possible Overall Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Key First:** The primary goal is to get the key *before* trying to reach the door.\n2.  **Conserve Sword:** The sword is a limited resource, so use it sparingly and strategically, primarily for dealing with enemies that block your path to the key and/or goal.\n3.  **Enemy Avoidance/Kiting:** Due to limited sword, avoid unneccessary combat. Exploit the different enemy speeds to avoid being cornered.  Lure slower enemies away from the key/door before making a move.\n4.  **Path Planning:** Think ahead.  Enemies move randomly, but you can predict their movement based on available space.\n5.  **Prioritize Threats:** Quick enemies are more dangerous than slow enemies, so deal with them first.\n6.  **Use Walls to Your Advantage:** Walls provide cover from enemies. Use them to plan safe movements.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> &\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> *\nrow=4, col=4 -> %\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
