    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules provided, here\u2019s an analysis of the game\u2019s genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and an overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fall within the puzzle or strategy genre, with elements of stealth and possibly survival. The presence of different sprite interactions suggests a system that requires players to think critically about positioning and actions.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites and their Functions:**\n   - **Floor:** Basic terrain where the game takes place.\n   - **Carcass:** Represents dead entities that can be interacted with.\n   - **Goat:** This is the player\u2019s avatar and may serve specific abilities or interactions.\n   - **Angry:** A hostile sprite that chases the player (goat).\n   - **Scared:** A fleeing sprite that reacts to various stimuli in the game.\n   - **Wall:** Obstacles that block movement.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The goat and walls cannot pass through each other but can collide with walls, causing the goat to step back.\n   - The avatar (goat) can be killed by the angry sprite, resulting in a score loss.\n   - Scared sprites can be transformed into carcasses upon interaction.\n   - A carcass can turn into an angry sprite if disturbed by a scared sprite.\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objective appears to be to manage the sprites effectively, ensuring that all scared sprites are converted or eliminated to achieve a win condition. Specifically:\n- You win if you manage to have all scared sprites (stype=scared).\n- You lose if your avatar (goat) is killed by the angry sprite.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** All sprites of the type \"scared\" are countered to zero (this means you have successfully dealt with all scared entities).\n- **Loss Condition:** If the avatar (the goat) is killed by an angry sprite, which likely represents a failure to manage positions or avoid dangers.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Dangerous Interactions:** \n   - Keep a safe distance from the angry sprite; make sure it does not come into contact with your avatar. Plan your movements carefully to avoid being cornered or trapped.\n\n2. **Utilize Obstacles:**\n   - Use walls strategically to block the angry sprite's path while you maneuver to scare other sprites and manipulate them into becoming carcasses.\n\n3. **Manage the Scared Sprites:**\n   - Focus on interacting with scared sprites to transform them into carcasses. After the transformation, control the situation by leading carcasses into positions that avoid interactions with the angry sprite, or try to convert them into angry sprites deliberately if necessary for your strategy.\n\n4. **Plan Your Movement:**\n   - Stay vigilant of your surroundings. Ensure you\u2019re not cornered by walls and chasers. Movement should be calculated, with contingency plans ready in case of any sprite becoming overly aggressive.\n\n5. **Avoid Collision with Walls:**\n   - Constantly check your movement to avoid colliding with walls as this can lead to being trapped or restricted in movement options, which could quickly turn into a loss against the angry sprite. \n\nBy employing these strategies while being mindful of the game rules and mechanics, players can navigate the game effectively to achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nscared -> '@'\nwall -> '#'\ncarcass -> '$'\nangry -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar (the goat) is positioned at (1, 6) and there are two scared sprites located at (5, 1) and (9, 21). There is also an angry sprite at (2, 7), which poses a threat to my avatar. The walls are situated around various areas, creating both obstacles and potential barriers against the angry sprite.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Immediate Threats:** The angry sprite is directly south of my avatar at (2, 7), which means it can potentially reach my position in the next move if I do not act carefully.\n2. **Objective:** I need to convert scared sprites into carcasses to minimize the number of scared sprites remaining. \n\n### Current Strategy:\n- Given the immediate threat from the angry sprite, I need to re-position my avatar to a safer spot while getting closer to the scared sprite at (5, 1). \n- Moving down first would place me in a precarious position due to the angry sprite being able to move upward easily after that. \n- The best action to start with is to move **left (1, 5)**, ensuring I remain away from the angry sprite's path while still having opportunities to chase the scared sprite.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:2 ``` \n```\nI will move right from (1, 6) to (1, 7). This keeps me safe from the angry sprite's immediate threat and positions me to redirect my movements towards converting the scared sprites into carcasses in subsequent moves.\n```",
