This genre often combines elements of puzzle-solving with controlling a character through a platforming environment, requiring strategic thinking and reflexive movement.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various predefined objects and entities interact in the game, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character.\n   - **Boulders & Boxes**: Objects that can alter the environment or interact with other elements.\n   - **Lasers & Cannons**: Act as hazards in the game that can kill the avatar based on specific conditions.\n   - **Goal**: The endpoint the player must reach to win.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player can push or interact with boxes and boulders to manipulate the game environment.\n   - Walls are immovable and serve as barriers; colliding with them causes the avatar to step back.\n   - Holes can kill both the avatar and certain objects, suggesting they are hazardous areas.\n   - The laser weapons can kill the avatar based on approach direction, introducing a directional gameplay element.\n   - The goal results in a win condition when the avatar reaches it, providing a score boost.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate the avatar through the environment to reach the goal sprite while avoiding dangers (lasers, holes, and boulders). The avatar must contend with various obstacles and traps to achieve this goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the goal (indicated by the 'goal' sprite) without being killed and score points.\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar is destroyed by lasers or falls into a hole, leading to game termination.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Path Planning**: Analyze the level layout to create a strategic path to the goal. Avoid areas where lasers are prevalent and be cautious of pushing boxes and boulders, which can potentially block your route or create hazardous situations.\n\n2. **Usage of Objects**:\n   - Use boxes as shields against frontal lasers or to block paths to manage hazards.\n   - Boulders can be used strategically to deal with lasers or create new paths but be cautious about their interaction with the avatar.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards**: Always be mindful of laser direction and wall locations. Make moves perpendicular to potential collision paths for better survival.\n\n4. **Testing Interactions**: Experiment with the rules, especially relationships between the avatar, boulders, and static objects like walls and holes. They can provide solutions to complex sections.\n\n5. **Score Maximization**: While the goal is to reach the endpoint, try to accumulate points by strategically killing sprites when possible (e.g., using boulders with holes).\n\n### Level Layout Implications:\nThe specific level arrangement contains walls that define pathways. Players should identify safe routes where they can navigate around boulders and position themselves to avoid dangerous interactions with the lasers or holes efficiently.\n\nOverall, players must combine strategic movement, puzzle-solving skills, and quick reflexes to succeed in reaching the objective while avoiding death from environmental hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> #\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To determine the next action for the avatar, I first need to identify the avatar's current position and the surrounding game state, notably any potential hazards or the goal.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- The avatar ('a') is located at row 2, col 2.\n- The goal ('$') is at row 1, col 1, and there is a hole ('%') at row 1, col 2 directly to the right of the goal.\n- The area surrounding the avatar includes:\n  - Above (row 1, col 2): Hole (hazard)\n  - Below (row 3, col 2): Empty space (safe to move)\n  - Left (row 2, col 1): Empty space (safe to move)\n  - Right (row 2, col 3): Empty space (safe to move)\n\nFrom the avatar's position, my primary objective is to reach the goal while avoiding the hole directly above it.\n\n### Action Decision:\n1. I can move left (to row 2, col 1) or down (to row 3, col 2) since both moves do not lead into danger immediately. However, reaching the goal requires moving upward eventually.\n2. Moving **up** into the position of the hole is dangerous, as I will be destroyed if I attempt to move into that slot.\n3. Moving **down** keeps options open for future movements while also sidestepping immediate hazards.\n\n### Selected Action:\nMoving **down** allows better positioning for future moves toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is to reposition the avatar to row 3, col 2, ensuring no immediate dangers while keeping the goal reachable in the next moves.",
