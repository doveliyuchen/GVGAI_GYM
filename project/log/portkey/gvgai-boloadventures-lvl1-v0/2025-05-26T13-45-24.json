Players must navigate through a level, managing movement and interaction with various environmental elements to reach the goal.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including walls, boxes, boulders, and a goal. The 'avatar' sprite represents the player\u2019s character.\n- **Interaction Types**: The game includes interactions between the avatar and other sprites, such as bouncing off boxes, stepping back from wall collisions, and being killed by lasers or falling into holes.\n- **Obstacle and Hazard Features**: There are walls, holes, boulders that can harm the avatar, as well as laser cannons that can shoot lasers in multiple directions.\n- **Goal**: The goal is denoted by the 'goal' sprite (noted as \"g0\"), which the player must reach to win the game.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to reach the 'goal' sprite while navigating around obstacles and avoiding hazards such as boulders, holes, and lasers.\n- A secondary objective may be to score points by interacting with other sprites, particularly by causing interactions that lead to \"scoreChange\".\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- You lose when the avatar sprite count reaches zero, which means you can no longer play.\n- You win when the goal sprite count reaches zero, which is achieved when the avatar interacts with or reaches the goal.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Route**: Analyze the layout of the level. Identify clear paths that avoid hazards while enabling useful interactions with blocks and boulders.\n\n2. **Use Boxes for Protection**: Move towards boxes to shield yourself from frontal laser attacks. Blocks can be manipulated to prevent lasers from hitting the avatar directly.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of boulders unless you can manipulate them into advantageous situations or move around them without direct contact.\n\n4. **Manipulate Obstacle Mechanics**: Use the interaction mechanics to your advantage, such as bouncing off boxes to gain height or adjust your position strategically to bypass walls.\n\n5. **Watch Laser Patterns**: If lasers are present, time your movements to ensure that you are not directly in their line of fire when moving.\n\n6. **Aim for the Goal**: Keep your route focused on getting to the goal while balancing the need to score points through interactions. Prioritize reaching the goal over scoring points if you're at risk of losing the avatar.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to experiment with different strategies for rearranging boxes or positioning relative to obstacles.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics and the layout, you can develop a strategy that minimizes risk while efficiently reaching the goal. Good luck!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, my avatar ('a') is located at position (2, 3) in the grid. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves\n- The immediate goal is to reach the goal sprite ('$') at (1, 1).\n- There is a hole ('%') at (1, 2) which should be avoided.\n- The avatar can move up, down, left, or right, but must avoid hazards like boulders ('@') and holes ('%').\n  \n### Potential Actions\n1. **Moving Left (2, 2)**: Would result in facing a box ('#'), and if moved again from there, may lead downwards toward more boxes or the walls.\n2. **Moving Right (2, 4)**: Would lead to an empty space ('.'), allowing further movement options.\n3. **Moving Up (1, 3)**: This leads to another empty space ('.'), allowing clear routes later.\n4. **Moving Down (3, 3)**: Also leads to an empty space ('.'), with further clear routes.\n\nConsidering the goal and the obstacles present, moving **up** from (2, 3) to (1, 3) is advantageous as it keeps me away from holes and could lead me closer to the goal on subsequent moves.\n\n### Choosing Action\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis move seems strategic as it keeps the avatar safe and retains multiple options for the next steps toward reaching the goal while simultaneously avoiding hazards.",
