It combines elements of platforming with strategic puzzle-solving using environmental interactions and sprite manipulation.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various immovable and movable elements are present: ground, walls, holes, boulders, a goal, an avatar (player character), boxes, and laser cannons.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can move through the environment, interact with objects, and face dangers. Key interactions include:\n  - Transforming items (boulders into boulderm and vice versa).\n  - Colliding with walls and boxes leading to different outcomes (step back, bounce forward).\n  - Avoiding or using lasers strategically. \n- **Lasers**: Operate as lethal hazards that can kill the avatar if encountered in a frontal direction.\n- **Scoring**: Completing the level and reaching the goal increases the score. Interacting with holes can also yield points.\n\n#### Objectives\nThe primary objectives of the game are:\n1. **Navigate to the Goal**: The player must guide the avatar to the goal (sprite 'goal') to succeed.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: The player must navigate without getting killed by lasers or falling into holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the goal sprite is reached; this results in a score increase and victory.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar count reaches zero, indicating the avatar has been eliminated.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand the Environment**: \n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of walls and holes. This will help avoid getting trapped or falling into hazards.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**:\n   - Use the boxes strategically to block lasers and create safe pathways. If necessary, bounce them off walls when trapped.\n  \n3. **Manage Boulders**:\n   - Utilize boulders to create space or activate different interactions. Be cautious, as they can also turn into dangerous boulders with consequences for the avatar.\n  \n4. **Navigate Carefully**:\n   - Move slowly and make thoughtful decisions, especially around lasers. Maintain awareness of the avatar's position relative to threats to avoid getting killed.\n  \n5. **Prioritize Scoring Opportunities**:\n   - Actively seek out opportunities to score points by interacting with holes when they don\u2019t threaten your avatar.\n  \n6. **Plan Your Path to the Goal**:\n   - Visualize a route to the goal that minimizes exposure to threats, using walls and other sprites to shield the avatar while advancing towards victory.\n\nUtilizing these strategies should enhance your playthrough and increase the likelihood of successfully reaching the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> a\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To determine the best action for the avatar's next move, let's analyze the current state of the game.\n\n**Current Position:**\nThe avatar (`a`) is currently located at (1, 3). \n\n**Immediate Objectives:**\nThe objective is to navigate to the goal (`$`) located at (1, 1) while avoiding hazards (holes at (1, 2) and (2, 1), and lasers which are not visible in this state).\n\n**Surrounding Environment:**\n- The goal is only two spaces to the left of the avatar, but there is a hole (`%`) at (1, 2) that blocks the direct path.\n- To reach the goal safely, the avatar needs to make a plan to avoid the hole and assess the best movement.\n\n**Available Actions:**\n1. **Move Left (2, 3)**: This cannot be executed as there is a hole at (1, 2).\n2. **Move Right (2, 4)**: Moves into an empty space; no immediate benefit towards the goal.\n3. **Move Down (2, 3)**: Moves to an empty space; would not yet approach the goal.\n4. **Move Up (0, 3)**: This would take the avatar up closer to the solid walls above.\n\nGiven these observations and considering that the left movement is blocked by a hole, the next best move is to navigate up to manage the backward movement better next time.\n\nHence, the best immediate action here is to execute:\n\n``` \nAction:4 \n```\n\nThis action should allow for further evaluation of subsequent moves either to the left or right after a potential upward shift, as planned towards the goal while keeping safety from surrounding hazards in mind.",
