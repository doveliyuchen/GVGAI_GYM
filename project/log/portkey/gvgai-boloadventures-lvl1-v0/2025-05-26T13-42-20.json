Players must navigate through a level, overcoming obstacles and utilizing mechanics in order to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprite Elements:**\n   - **Ground**: The base for all movement.\n   - **Wall**: Acts as an immovable obstacle that blocks the player's path.\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Goal**: The target destination to win the game.\n   - **Boxes and Boulders**: Objects used to manipulate and interact with other elements in the level.\n   - **Lasers**: Moveable hazards that inflict damage to the player.\n   - **Holes**: Lead to the removal of the player\u2019s avatar when interacted with.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with various objects, altering their state or moving them to achieve certain outcomes.\n   - Attention to directionality (e.g., stepping back from obstacles, killing sprites when frontal) is crucial.\n   - Items like the box can provide shields against certain dangers (e.g., lasers) when positioned correctly.\n   \n3. **Movement and Positioning:**\n   - The avatar must be tactically positioned to utilize walls, boxes, and boulders effectively.\n   - Certain interactions (like 'bounceForward') suggest the importance of momentum and positioning.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The goal of the game is to reach the designated 'goal' sprite while avoiding hazards and leveraging the environment (such as boxes and boulders) to navigate effectively.\n- Collecting points through interactions (such as scoring when an avatar reaches the goal or kills are registered by the laser) appears to be a secondary objective.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by reaching the 'goal', which will cause a score increase.\n- The game is lost if the avatar is removed from the game (SpriteCounter limit of 0), primarily due to hazards like lasers or falling into holes.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Get familiar with the level layout to identify the locations of key elements (goal, walls, hazards).\n  \n2. **Obstacle Management**: Use boxes and boulders strategically to shield against lasers and to create pathways. Moving them into favorable positions can clear the way or create a barrier.\n\n3. **Positioning**: Maintain awareness of your avatar's direction relative to lasers. Avoid being directly in line with the lasers at all times. Masking your movements with boxes can help you navigate without taking hits.\n\n4. **Careful Exploration**: Movement should be cautious to avoid unintentional interactions that could lead to losing the avatar. Steps should be calculated to prevent falling into holes or encountering lasers frontal.\n\n5. **Utilize Points of Interest**: Aim for the goal while taking advantage of scoring opportunities, but don't be overly aggressive as it can lead to hazards.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**: Given the interactions available, especially with the boulder and hole mechanics, it may require some experimentation to devise the most effective route to the goal.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies and focusing on strategic positioning, players can navigate the level more effectively, avoid hazards, and reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> #\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, my avatar 'a' is located at (row 3, col 2) on the map. The goal '$' is located at (row 1, col 1) and there are several obstacles and hazards surrounding my current position. The challenges include boxes '#', walls '&', and holes '%'. As per the strategy outlined, I need to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, particularly regarding the positioning relative to hazards like holes.\n\n### Current State Observations:\n- The goal is two rows above and one column to the left from my current position.\n- To reach the goal, I can navigate upward and left.\n- There are boxes that I can potentially use for both shielding and manipulating my movement across the map.\n- The immediate hazards (like holes) should be avoided to prevent losing the game.\n\n### Action Reasoning:\n1. Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) would put my avatar at (row 3, col 1), which is free of any immediate hazards, and will bring me closer to the goal.  \n2. After moving left, I would be positioned to explore further upward in subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action changes my position to (row 3, col 1), allowing me to explore towards the goal effectively and avoid hazards.",
