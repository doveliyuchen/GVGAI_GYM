    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fit into the **puzzle** genre, with elements of **platforming** and potential **adventure**, given that players need to navigate a map and manipulate objects to achieve certain goals.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - The game features various sprites including walls, obstacles (like boulders and boxes), goals, hazards (like lasers), and the player's avatar.\n   - Movements and interactions are essential; the avatar can interact with walls, holes, boxes, and lasers in different ways.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The interactions between sprites create a set of rules for movement and conflict:\n     - **Avatar Movement**: The avatar can bounce when colliding with boxes and be pushed back by walls.\n     - **Object Transformation**: Certain interactions change the state of objects (e.g., boulders can turn into moving missiles).\n     - **Hazards**: The avatar must avoid lasers, which can kill on contact.\n\n3. **Scoring**:\n   - Players gain score points by certain interactions (e.g., when the avatar reaches the goal or when certain conditions related to the boulders and holes are met).\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the **goal** represented by the \"g0\" sprite. Along the way, players need to navigate obstacles and avoid hazards. Specifically, the goal is to increase the score and ensure that the avatar remains intact while exploring the environment.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the avatar reaches the goal sprite. This results in a score increase.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter limit for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Navigate Carefully**: Since walls and hazards like lasers can kill the avatar or push it back, the player should move carefully and plan each action.\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Boxes can be used to shield against lasers, so placing boxes strategically can help protect the avatar.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Staying away from lasers and holes is critical. Players should observe the layout of hazards and plan paths accordingly.\n4. **Utilize Boulders**: The interactions with boulders can create pathways or lead to potential traps. Players should explore these interactions thoroughly to optimize movement.\n5. **Scoring Opportunities**: Look for ways to engage with the environment to maximize scoring, particularly by manipulating interactions with boxes and boulders to create advantageous scenarios.\n\nOverall, the player should balance between strategic movement, interaction with environment sprites, and progressing towards the goal while avoiding potential hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> a\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> #\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> #\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is located at row 4, column 2, marked as 'a'. The closest goal is at row 1, column 1, marked as '$', while avoiding hazards like the hole located at row 1, column 2 (represented as '%') and navigating through walls.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant surroundings:\n- You are surrounded by walls to the north and south, which restricts vertical movement.\n- To the left (row 4, col 1) is an empty space ('.') and a box (row 4, col 5) which can be used to manipulate your path.\n- The goal is positioned above, but reaching it directly is blocked by walls and a hazardous hole.\n\nGiven this layout, your immediate best option is to explore the available space adjacent to your avatar to navigate toward the upper rows, ultimately towards the goal.\n\nCurrently, you can only move right, left, or up without hitting the walls. However, there seems to be a better route by making use of box movements and navigating strategically.\n\nTo begin solving this puzzle, let's move one space **up** to row 3, col 2, as this action not only moves your avatar closer to navigating around the wall area but also gets you that much closer to potential interactions moving forward.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action gets you closer to strategizing a route toward the goal, and I expect to explore more options next turn safely.",
