    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules, the game can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to fall into the **puzzle-platformer** genre. It features platforming elements with character interactions and environmental puzzles to solve.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites and Interactions**:\n   - Various sprites exist, including the player avatar (`C`), enemies (e.g., boulders and lasers), obstacles (walls, holes), and goals.\n   - The player interacts with these sprites through collisions, which can result in transformations, bouncing, killing, or protection based on the sprite types involved.\n   - The avatar can be harmed by lasers and boulders, while certain objects (like boxes) can protect the avatar from hazards.\n\n2. **Avatar Movement**: \n   - The avatar can move and interact with various objects. Its movements affect its status (bounced back, killed, or protected).\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - The main goal is to reach the `goal` sprite (`g`) while avoiding obstacles like the `hole` and `laser`, which can result in the loss of the game.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the `goal` sprite, which grants a score increase and signals successful level completion.\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n   - The avatar is killed (either by falling into a hole or colliding with a laser).\n   - If there are no avatars left in play (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Environment Awareness**:\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout and identify critical paths to the goal, avoiding hazards and finding safe zones.\n   \n2. **Use of Boxes**:\n   - Use boxes strategically to shield the avatar from lasers when moving through dangerous areas. Keep in mind the interactions between boxes, walls, and other sprites.\n\n3. **Movement Planning**:\n   - Plan movements carefully to minimize the risk of falling into holes or getting hit by lasers. Keep track of where lasers are directed at and move accordingly.\n\n4. **Avoid Enemies**:\n   - Avoid confrontation with boulders and lasers unless needed. If you encounter a boulder, be cautious as they can transform and potentially put your avatar at risk.\n\n5. **Goal Orientation**:\n   - Prioritize reaching the goal as your ultimate objective. Before interacting with other elements or picking up items, ensure your path towards the goal remains clear and safe.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, players can navigate the puzzle aspects of the game effectively while evading threats and progressing towards victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> a\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> #\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game and decide on an action, we can observe the following details:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: Your avatar is located at `(3, 1)`.\n2. **Surrounding Environment**:\n   - Directly above `(2, 1)`: It's a `hole` (`%`). If you move up, you would fall and lose.\n   - Directly below `(4, 1)`: It's a `box` (`#`), which is safe to move to.\n   - To the left `(3, 0)`: It's a `wall` (`&`), so moving left is not possible.\n   - To the right `(3, 2)`: It's a `ground` (`.`), which is an open space.\n\nBased on this analysis, your immediate safe move would be to go down to `(4, 1)` where the box is located. This position maintains safety while ensuring you progress through the level.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the action to move down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down to `(4, 1)` should keep me in a safe area, allowing further exploration without falling into a hole.",
