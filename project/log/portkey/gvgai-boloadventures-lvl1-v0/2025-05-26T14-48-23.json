The emphasis is on navigating a space with various interactions between sprites (characters or objects) that either help or hinder progress.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites interact in specific ways:\n   - **Ground, Wall, Hole, Goal**: These are static obstacles or targets.\n   - **Avatar**: The player character that can interact with other sprites in the game.\n   - **Box, Boulder, Lasercannon**: These are movable or passive objects that serve as tools or hurdles in navigation.\n\n2. **Interactions**: \n   - The player can push or bounce off objects, making strategic movements essential.\n   - The avatar can die if it runs into specific threats (e.g., lasers, holes).\n   - Boulders and lasers can transform the game state, leading to new interactions.\n\n3. **Goal**: The main objective is to reach the **goal sprite** while managing the various interactions and avoiding being killed by threats.\n\n### Objective\nThe player must navigate from the starting position to the goal while manipulating other sprites and avoiding deadly interactions. Scoring is also a component, with points earned by reaching the goal and potentially through other interactions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The level is won when the avatar reaches the goal sprite (achieving a score of 5).\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar is eliminated (counter reaches 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the layout. Note the positions of boulders, boxes, lasers, and the goal. Avoid moving into sections where you can't anticipate interactions.\n  \n2. **Use Objects Wisely**: Leverage boxes to shield from lasers and boulders to manipulate pathways. Try to create safe paths to the goal using these objects.\n\n3. **Plan Your Moves**: Anticipate how each interaction will go. For example, avoid direct paths into lasers by using boxes to block them or approaching from angles where the lasers can't hit you.\n\n4. **Avoid High-Danger Areas**: Stay away from areas with many hazards, like around hole sprites or in line with lasers. Create opportunities to move safely instead of rushing.\n\n5. **Focus on Goal Achievement**: Stay oriented toward reaching the goal at all times. If necessary, re-route and manipulate the environment rather than getting caught in combat with threats.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies while being patient and thoughtful about sprite interactions, you can work toward successfully completing each level in this puzzle platformer.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> a\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> #\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> #\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> #\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> #\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> #\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To strategize based on the current state of the game, first, we need to identify the position of the avatar and any immediate obstacles or opportunities for interaction.\n\n### Current Position\n- The avatar ('a') is at row 2, column 3 (2,3).\n\n### Surrounding State Analysis\nFrom (2,3), the adjacent tiles are:\n- Up (1,3): a ground (.)\n- Down (3,3): a ground (.)\n- Left (2,2): a box (#)\n- Right (2,4): a ground (.)\n\nThe goal ('$') is located at (1,1), and there are holes ('%') at (1,2) and (2,1).\n\n### Available Moves\n1. **Up (1,3)**: No immediate danger; allows continued upward or sideways movement without risk of falling into a hole.\n2. **Down (3,3)**: Also safe; opens up options for further exploration downward.\n3. **Left (2,2)**: Moves into a box (#), which is useful to manipulate later for blocking or creating paths.\n4. **Right (2,4)**: Safe ground.\n\n### Analysis and Decision\nGiven that both up and down movements lead to safe grounds, moving left to the box is strategic as it allows us to interact with the box immediately. Additionally, moving left could set up future movements to potentially block the hole at (1,2) or open pathways toward the goal at (1,1).\n\n**Taking action to move left seems prudent as it opens up more options for future moves and allows interaction with the box.**\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to the box will create opportunities for leveraging it in subsequent moves towards the goal.",
