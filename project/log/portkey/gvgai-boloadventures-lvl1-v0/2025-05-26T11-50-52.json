Players navigate a maze-like environment, solving challenges involving various sprites and obstacles.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Roles:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character.\n   - **Goal:** The target location which must be reached for victory.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that force players to navigate around them.\n   - **Boulders/Boxes:** Objects that can be interacted with to block paths or create barriers.\n   - **Lasers:** Environmental hazards that can kill the character if approached incorrectly.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Certain actions trigger transformations or movements of sprites, such as making players bounce off boxes or altering the state of boulders when they collide with specific objects.\n   - The avatar can perish if it interacts with lasers in a frontal encounter, emphasizing strategic movement.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary goal is to navigate the avatar from its starting position to the goal while avoiding hazards and managing sprite interactions.\n- The avatar must also be cautious of holes and lasers that can lead to immediate failure.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- Winning occurs when the avatar reaches the goal (indicated by a score change of 5).\n- Losing occurs if the avatar is killed by a laser or if it steps into a hole, at which point the game ends.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Mapping the Environment:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify where obstacles and hazards are located (walls, holes, and lasers).\n   - Use walls to your advantage to block lasers while planning your path to the goal.\n\n2. **Sprite Management:**\n   - Manipulate boxes and boulders carefully to create paths or block hazards.\n   - Utilize the transformations of boulders and boxes to shield the avatar from laser attacks.\n\n3. **Movement Strategy:**\n   - Move cautiously around the level, taking one step at a time to observe the response of lasers and the environment.\n   - Avoid confrontations with holes and lasers where possible, ensuring all movements are calculated.\n\n4. **Prioritize Safety:**\n   - Always keep a mental note of where holes and lasers are positioned relative to your avatar and use surrounding sprites as shields or obstacles as necessary.\n\n5. **Goal-Oriented Approach:**\n   - Focus on reaching the goal with every movement. Align your strategy to create paths that minimize risk while maximizing efficiency to reach the goal.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can successfully navigate the level, avoid hazards, and ultimately reach the goal without losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbox ground -> 'b'\nboulder ground -> 'c'\nlcleft ground -> 'l'\nlcright ground -> 'r'\nlcup ground -> 'u'\nlcdown ground -> 'd'\nhole ground -> '0'\ngoal ground -> 'g'\nground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\nbox -> '#'\ngoal -> '$'\nhole -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> $\nrow=1, col=2 -> %\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> #\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> #\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> #\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> %\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> #\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> #\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> #\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> #\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> #\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> #\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> #\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> #\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> #\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> #\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> #\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> #\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> @\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> #\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> #\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> #\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is located at (row=2, col=2). The goal is situated at (row=1, col=1), and there is a hole directly below the goal at (row=1, col=2). To reach the goal safely, I need to avoid stepping into either the hole or directly engaging with any lasers.\n\n### Observations:\n1. I have walls (impassable barriers) all around me at row=0 and at the sides of the map.\n2. The path from my current position at (row=2, col=2) to the goal at (row=1, col=1) is immediately blocked by a hole at (row=1, col=2).\n3. Directly above me (row=1, col=2) is the hole, making movement into that space a loss for my avatar.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the layout and the immediate danger of the hole, I would need to explore alternate paths that allow me to interact with the boxes and find a route without putting myself at risk of the hole. \n\nSince the direct path to the goal is unsafe, I will attempt to move downward, which allows for a reevaluation of my position and access to potential alternative routes.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is to move my avatar downward to (row=3, col=2). I expect this action will take me to a space where I can better analyze further moves towards reaching the goal while avoiding hazards.",
