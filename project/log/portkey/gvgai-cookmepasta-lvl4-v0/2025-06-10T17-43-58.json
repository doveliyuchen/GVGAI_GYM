Players must navigate a character through a grid-like environment, solving puzzles in the process. The culinary theme suggests a cooking-related or food assembly context.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Movement**: The game features various interactive sprites (game elements) like the avatar (a chef), food items, a lock, and walls. The avatar can move freely but must interact correctly with food and other objects to score points or reach goals.\n- **Interactions**: Players can combine ingredients\u2014raw pasta, tomato, tuna, etc.\u2014to create dishes, represented by different sprites. Some combinations yield positive results while others lead to incorrect placements, resulting in score penalties.\n- **Collecting Resources**: A key resource allows access to certain areas, adding an exploration aspect to the game.\n- **Score System**: Completing combinations correctly increases the score, while wrong combinations reduce it. \n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to create a \"plateinplace\" by combining the right ingredients in the correct sequence while avoiding the wrong combinations. The final tasks involve correctly assembling the pasta dish by interacting with ingredients and utilizing boiling water effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins by achieving a \"plateinplace\" status.\n- **Losing Condition**: The player loses if they create a \"wrongplace\" before successfully creating a \"plateinplace.\" Specifically, if a \"wrongplace\" exceeds one instance, the game ends negatively.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before making any combination of ingredients, consider the interactions and potential outcomes. Familiarize yourself with which ingredients combine positively and negatively to avoid mistakes.\n\n2. **Use the Boiling Water Effectively**: Since raw pasta needs to be transformed into \"pastainplace\" in boiling water, prioritize accessing boiling water after collecting necessary ingredients.\n\n3. **Collect the Key Early**: The key will enable access to locked areas which might contain essential resources. Ensure you retrieve it at the earliest opportunity.\n\n4. **Simultaneous Ingredient Management**: Keep track of all ingredients. Aim to prepare multiple components of the dish simultaneously if the level layout permits.\n\n5. **Avoid Penalty Combinations**: Be cautious with ingredient combinations that lead to \"wrongplace.\" Keep the possibility of backtracking in mind to mitigate errors by utilizing the lock/wall interactions wisely.\n\n6. **Use Placements Wisely**: After obtaining \"pastainplace\" and \"sauceinplace,\" combining them should yield \"plateinplace\" for maximum score gain. Plan these moves in succession to avoid introducing any \"wrongplace\" at that stage.\n\nBy implementing this strategy, players can improve their chances of successfully completing the level while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> a\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

Since I cannot move directly to the key because of walls and obstacles, I need to navigate toward it strategically.\n\nGiven the current position of my avatar, the next best action is to move one step left to (7, 1), thus preparing for a move toward the key. This movement will help me assess further how to proceed afterward while not staying stagnant.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect that moving left will keep me on track to gather necessary resources while avoiding the penalties of incorrect combinations.",
