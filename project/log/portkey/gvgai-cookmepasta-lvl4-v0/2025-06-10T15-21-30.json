Players need to manipulate items (ingredients) to complete cooking tasks.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different types of sprites represent various game elements, including the player-controlled avatar (chef), ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna), and environment (walls, locks).\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the game grid, interacting with various items to achieve tasks.\n- **Transformations**: Certain combinations of ingredients lead to transformations into other sprites, affecting game state and score.\n- **Interaction with Environment**: The game includes mechanics for collecting keys, unlocking locks, and score adjustments depending on successful or incorrect combinations of ingredients.\n- **Scoring**: Players receive points for correct actions (e.g., creating 'plateinplace') and lose points for incorrect combinations (e.g., 'wrongplace').\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to produce the final dish represented as 'plateinplace' while avoiding creating 'wrongplace' scenarios with the ingredients. \n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Players win the game by creating one instance of 'plateinplace'.\n- **Loss Condition**: Players lose the game if they end up with one instance of 'wrongplace', indicating that a mistake has been made in ingredient combination.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Understand the Ingredients**: Familiarize yourself with how different ingredients interact. Focus on combinations that yield positive results (e.g., raw pasta needs to be cooked in boiling water).\n  \n2. **Identify Key Relationships**:\n   - Combine raw pasta with boiling water to transition it to 'pastainplace'.\n   - Combine tomato and tuna to create 'sauceinplace', crucial for achieving 'plateinplace'.\n  \n3. **Plan Moves**: Before making a move, consider how each ingredient combination will affect your score and progress toward the objective. Avoid unnecessary actions that might lead to 'wrongplace'.\n  \n4. **Collect the Key**: Ensure to obtain the key as it seems necessary to overcome the locked areas, allowing further access to continue your cooking tasks.\n\n5. **Layout Navigation**: Carefully navigate the level layout while avoiding walls and locks, and watch for spaces conducive to successful ingredient placement.\n\n6. **Avoid Wrong Combinations**: Keep track of items that have resulted in 'wrongplace' outcomes and avoid using them together in future moves.\n\nBy strategically progressing through the game while adhering to these guidelines, players can effectively navigate the challenges and work towards winning by crafting the desired dish.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> a\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "To determine the best course of action given the current game state, we need to analyze the avatar's position and the surrounding environment. The avatar is currently located at (3, 5).\n\n### Current Game State Analysis:\n- The avatar ('a') is surrounded by:\n  - North (2, 5): Wall ('b')\n  - South (4, 5): Wall ('b')\n  - West (3, 4): Empty floor ('.')\n  - East (3, 6): Empty floor ('.')\n  \n- Based on the mechanics, the avatar can only move into available spaces, represented by floor or interact with items. The avatar is positioned in a place where it cannot move up or down due to walls on those sides. The best immediate options available for movement are left (to (3, 4)) or right (to (3, 6)).\n\nFrom the previous state, the avatar\u2019s position remains the same, hence we will need to change our action since the last action did not cause movement.\n\n### Next Action:\nMoving left to (3, 4) does not bring any immediate reward, but moving right to (3, 6) allows more exploration as there are empty spaces down the line. Thus, I will choose to move right to (3, 6).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right is expected to yield an empty space which will allow further navigation and assess what potential items (if any) can be reached next.",
