It appears to involve navigating a grid-like environment with various interactive objects.\n\n### Game Mechanics \n1. **Sprites and Interactions**: \n   - **Sprites** include the avatar (chef), ingredients (raw pasta, tomato, tuna), cooking elements (boiling water, sauces), and objects (key, lock, food).\n   - The avatar moves around the tiles (floor), collecting ingredients and completing tasks by combining them through specific interactions.\n   - Players must manage the placement of ingredients to avoid producing \"wrongplace\" items that waste points.\n\n2. **Transformations**: \n   - Ingredients can be combined to create the correct dish or lead to incorrect outcomes that cost points.\n   - Successfully combining pasta and sauce leads to a finished plate that contributes to winning conditions.\n   - Failure conditions arise from excessive incorrect combinations, defined by the wrongplace counter.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: \n   - The key is a limited resource used to interact with the lock, which may block paths or hinder progress.\n\n### Game Objective \nThe primary objective is to create a dish (in the form of 'plateinplace') using the ingredients while avoiding incorrect combinations (wrongplace). Besides that, the player must manage the key to access certain areas and potentially influence the game state (like unlocking or manoeuvring around obstacles).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions \n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by successfully creating at least one 'plateinplace'.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the wrongplace counter reaches its limit, indicating too many incorrect ingredient combinations.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy \n1. **Plan Your Moves**: \n   - Before making a move, think ahead about the order of ingredient combinations and how they can lead from one step to the next without resulting in a wrong outcome. \n\n2. **Collect the Key**: \n   - Prioritize collecting the key early on, as it can unlock further possibilities in the game and remove obstacles, allowing for better access to ingredients.\n\n3. **Combine Wisely**: \n   - Use the boiling water to transform only when you have raw pasta. Be cautious with combinations; think about what ingredients can pair effectively to avoid 'wrongplace' outcomes.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**: \n   - It may take a few attempts to successfully create the dish, so don\u2019t be discouraged by setbacks. Learn from the mechanics that lead to wrong placements to refine your strategy in subsequent tries.\n\n5. **Resource Management**:\n   - Since the ability to create dishes is based on positive scoring, manage how you use water, sauce, and other ingredients to maximize points.\n\nThis strategy, combined with careful planning and execution based on the game mechanics, will improve your chances of achieving the win condition while minimizing errors.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> a\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The immediate surroundings include several interactive elements:\n\n- **Above (7, 2):** empty floor (.)\n- **Below (9, 2):** empty floor (.)\n- **Left (8, 1):** empty floor (.)\n- **Right (8, 3):** boiling water (@)\n- **Key position (5, 8):** located above your row.\n- **Accessing the ingredients:** The closest ingredient to you is the boiling water, which can help create the dish once you have the raw pasta.\n\n### Current Assessment\nTo effectively progress in the game:\n1. Your immediate goal can be to access the boiling water to pair with any raw pasta you can collect.\n2. Collecting the key would also be beneficial as it may lead to accessing other helpful items or ingredients.\n\n### Next Move\nSince moving towards the right (to the boiling water) allows you to interact with it immediately, this is a sensible next action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis should help you gather the boiling water, which is crucial for cooking the raw pasta later. I expect this aligns well with the strategy of planning ahead by utilizing nearby resources effectively.",
