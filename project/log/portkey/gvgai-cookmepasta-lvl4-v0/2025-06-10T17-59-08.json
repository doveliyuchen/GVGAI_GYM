Players are tasked with combining ingredients and interacting with various objects to achieve a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:**  \n   - **Movable Avatar (Chef):** The player character that can interact with other items.\n   - **Immovable Objects:** Walls, locks, and floors that constrain movement and require navigation around them.\n   - **Passive Objects:** Ingredients and locations that can be interacted with but do not move.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Combining raw ingredients (like pasta, tuna, and tomatoes) with other objects can yield different results\u2014either beneficial (score increases) or detrimental (score decreases).\n   - Important interactions include boiling raw pasta, creating a sauce by combining tomatoes and tuna, and then placing them together on a plate.\n\n3. **Resources and Collectibles:**\n   - A 'key' is a collectible resource that is necessary to unlock certain areas but has a limit of one in play.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main goal is to create a 'plateinplace' by combining the correct ingredients and cooking processes effectively. Successful placement and combinations lead to score increases and advancing the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Successfully create a 'plateinplace', which is achieved through the correct combination of pasta and sauce.\n- **Loss Condition:** If a player accumulates a single 'wrongplace' item as a result of incorrect ingredient combinations, the game is lost.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Before interacting with items, strategize your moves based on the layout. Identify how to navigate walls and reach the key first without prematurely encountering locks or walls.\n\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:**\n   - Collect the key early as it enables access to potentially critical areas (represented by the lock). This step is key to progressing the game and unlocking further ingredients.\n\n3. **Minimize Wrong Combinations:**\n   - Keep track of ingredient combinations to avoid accruing 'wrongplace' items, which can lead to immediate loss. Pay special attention to interactions that yield negatives (like combining raw pasta with boiling water and sauce).\n\n4. **Correct Ingredient Sequence:**\n   - Aim to boil the raw pasta before combining it with the sauce. Secure tomato and tuna before placing them correctly. Ensure to sequence your actions to maximize scoring and minimize wastage.\n\n5. **Positioning is Key:**\n   - Navigate the level carefully, as the walls and layout impact where you can move. Always strive to remain aware of your positioning relative to the ingredients and final plate.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can increase their chances of success while minimizing mistakes, creating an engaging experience within this culinary puzzle environment.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> @\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

To create the 'plateinplace', we will need the boiled pasta, tuna, and tomato.\n2. We should navigate towards the necessary items while avoiding creating any 'wrongplace' items.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The immediate next step is to gather resources. Since we need to get to the raw pasta, which is at (5, 4), we should move down from (6, 5).\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down will bring us one step closer to the raw pasta, allowing us to collect it and proceed with the cooking process without changing our avatar's position unnecessarily.",
