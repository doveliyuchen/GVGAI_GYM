Players must strategize to combine ingredients correctly to prepare dishes while navigating through a level that includes obstacles and a locking mechanism.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n- **Sprites**: \n  - The game features various sprites like \"avatar,\" \"floor,\" \"key,\" \"lock,\" and ingredients like \"raw pasta,\" \"tomato,\" and \"tuna.\"\n  - There are immovable and active sprites, indicating that players must interact strategically with both types.\n\n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar can collect resources (like a key) and interact with food and obstacles to create or transform items.\n  - Combining ingredients in the correct order yields positive scores, while incorrect combinations lead to negative scores or 'wrongplace' results.\n  \n- **Scoring**: \n  - Successful actions (like creating a 'plateinplace') provide score increases, while mistakes lead to score deductions, illustrating a risk-reward dynamic.\n\n**Objective**:\nThe main goal is to create a 'plateinplace' by combining the right ingredients (raw pasta, sauce, etc.). To win, players must avoid making incorrect combinations that lead to 'wrongplace' statuses while navigating through the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- Win Condition: Successfully has at least one instance of the 'plateinplace' sprite in the level.\n- Loss Condition: Accumulating one instance of 'wrongplace' will result in a loss.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before interacting with any ingredients, analyze the layout and plan the sequence of actions. Move strategically to keep your position flexible and avoid locking yourself into mistakes.\n\n2. **Gather Resources**:\n   - Aim to collect the key early on, as it is important for opening locks that could be blocking critical paths.\n   - Ensure you have the correct ingredients needed to construct the 'plateinplace' before attempting any combinations.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**:\n   - Start by placing the raw pasta into boiling water to transform it into the 'pastainplace', which is essential for further combinations.\n   - Ensure that you combine ingredients systematically \u2013 only mix the tomato with tuna after making sure you have cooked pasta ready to prevent 'wrongplace' outcomes.\n\n4. **Avoid Mistakes**:\n   - Keep track of which combinations have led to negative scores. Avoid using combinations that lead to 'wrongplace', as that can end your game.\n   - Be cautious when using boiling water, as it can interact negatively with certain combinations; use it only when necessary.\n\n5. **Check for Obstructions**:\n   - Navigate around walls and locks carefully, as they can limit your movement and actions. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially before making decisions that might cause you to step back or undo progress.\n\nBy following these strategic guidelines and keeping an eye on score management, you can work towards building a successful recipe while navigating the challenges of the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> &\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> *\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> a\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> %\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> @\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",
