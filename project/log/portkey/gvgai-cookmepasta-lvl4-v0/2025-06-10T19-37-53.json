The player must manipulate ingredients within the environment to achieve specific culinary objectives.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites and Characters:**\n   - The player controls an avatar (a chef) that moves around a grid-based environment.\n   - There are immovable walls, as well as various food components (e.g., raw pasta, tomatoes, tuna) that can be interacted with.\n   - The player can collect a key to unlock a door (lock sprite).\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Combining ingredients yields results, but improper combinations affect the score negatively (wrongplace sprites).\n   - The raw pasta needs to be boiled to become pastainplace, which can then be combined with sauceinplace for a final dish (plateinplace).\n   - Collecting the key allows access to certain areas of the map.\n\n3. **Scoring System:**\n   - Successful combinations result in a positive score change, while incorrect placements result in penalties.\n   - The objective is to create a complete dish (plateinplace) while avoiding wrong combinations.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to prepare a dish by transforming ingredients into a plateinplace (cooked dish) while avoiding wrongplace outcomes. The player must navigate the environment, collect the key, unlock the door, and appropriately manage ingredient combinations.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by creating at least one plateinplace.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if they create a wrongplace sprite (more than one instantiation of it).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Management:** \n   - Prioritize collecting the key to unlock the door early in the game, as this can open up more opportunities for interaction with ingredients.\n\n2. **Ingredient Combinations:**\n   - Focus on boiling the raw pasta first to create pastainplace before attempting to interact with other ingredients.\n   - Avoid combining raw pasta with tomatoes and tuna unless you're certain it will achieve a valid outcome (i.e., cooking).\n\n3. **Planning Moves:**\n   - Carefully plan your moves to prevent getting stuck between walls and locked doors. Use available space efficiently to navigate to necessary ingredients.\n\n4. **Trial and Error:**\n   - If a combination fails, analyze what went wrong and adjust your strategy. Keep track of what combinations yield positive scores and which ones result in wrongplace placements.\n\n5. **Avoid Overcrowding Wrongplace:**\n   - Be cautious about the wrongplace sprite limit. Maintaining awareness of your current interactions will help minimize the risk of getting stuck in a losing condition.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the game mechanics, players can successfully navigate the puzzle elements of the game to achieve their culinary goals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\npastainplace -> 'w'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> *\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> a\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, our avatar ('a') is located at coordinates (8, 4). The closest actions we can take involve navigating through the grid while avoiding walls and aiming to collect ingredients to prepare a dish. There is a wall to the left at (8, 3) and to the right at (8, 5), while upward at (7, 4) and downward at (9, 4) are both open spaces.\n\nFollowing the strategy, I should prioritize movement that will allow me to navigate the environment effectively and collect the key since it appears to be located at (1, 3), which is quite a distance away but can be accessed from the current position.\n\nSince I can move up or down and there are more floors in the same row downwards that I can further explore, I will choose to move down first.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action should allow me to see more of the map and possibly collect or interact with more ingredients. The expectation is that moving down will provide more options for future actions, aligning with the strategy of resource management.",
