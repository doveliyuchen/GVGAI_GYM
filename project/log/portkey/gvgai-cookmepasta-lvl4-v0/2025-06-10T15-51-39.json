Players must interact with various ingredients, tools, and obstacles to create a dish while navigating a grid layout.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Movement and Interaction:**\n   - The player controls a character (a chef) that can navigate through a grid and interact with various objects.\n   - The chef can collect a key and manipulate different food items to either correctly or incorrectly assemble ingredients.\n\n2. **Unique Sprites:**\n   - The game utilizes a variety of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, locks), resources (keys), and food items (raw pasta, tomato, tuna). \n   - Certain items can be transformed into new states upon interaction (like raw pasta becoming \"pastainplace\" when combined with boiling water).\n\n3. **Score Changes:**\n   - Interactions yield score adjustments, which are crucial for determining win/loss outcomes. Correct combinations lead to positive scores, while improper combinations result in penalties.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective is to transform raw food ingredients into a complete dish (represented by the `plateinplace` sprite) while avoiding wrong placements (represented by the `wrongplace` sprite). Players must strategically collect the key to unlock the lock, all while managing their interactions to avoid negative score impacts.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins if they successfully place at least one `plateinplace` on the board.\n- The player loses if there is ever one `wrongplace` on the board, which indicates an incorrect food assembly.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Before making any interactions, observe the layout and plan the sequence in which you will combine the ingredients to minimize any wrong placements.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:**\n   - Retrieve the key as soon as possible since unlocking the lock is necessary to finish the game. This will allow for more movement and fewer restrictions later.\n  \n3. **Use Boiling Water Wisely:**\n   - Combine raw pasta with boiling water early in the game to create `pastainplace`, as it's crucial for progressing towards the final dish. \n\n4. **Keep Track of Ingredient Combinations:**\n   - Be conscious of which combinations lead to `sauceinplace` and `plateinplace` while avoiding the combinations that lead to `wrongplace`. Every interaction can either be beneficial or detrimental.\n   \n5. **Avoid Traps:**\n   - Be mindful not to create a situation where you have to backtrack (such as getting stuck with a `wrongplace` item). Always be cautious of how multiple interactions can lead to undesired outcomes.\n\n6. **Resource Management:**\n   - Maintain focus on managing your resources (i.e., the items on the board) effectively to avoid unnecessary penalties and maximize your score.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can navigate through the game more effectively, leading to victory by successfully creating the dish without encountering wrong placements.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nboilingwater floor -> 'b'\nrawpasta floor -> 'p'\ntomato floor -> 'o'\ntuna floor -> 't'\nkey floor -> 'k'\nlock floor -> 'l'\nfloor -> '.'\nboilingwater -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nlock -> '$'\nrawpasta -> '%'\ntomato -> '&'\ntuna -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> $\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> &\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> b\nrow=2, col=4 -> b\nrow=2, col=5 -> b\nrow=2, col=6 -> b\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> b\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> b\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> b\nrow=2, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> *\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> b\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> b\nrow=4, col=4 -> b\nrow=4, col=5 -> b\nrow=4, col=6 -> b\nrow=4, col=7 -> b\nrow=4, col=8 -> b\nrow=4, col=9 -> b\nrow=4, col=10 -> b\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> b\nrow=5, col=4 -> @\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> b\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> b\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> %\nrow=6, col=10 -> b\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> b\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> b\nrow=7, col=8 -> b\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> b\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> a\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=10, col=0 -> b\nrow=10, col=1 -> b\nrow=10, col=2 -> b\nrow=10, col=3 -> b\nrow=10, col=4 -> b\nrow=10, col=5 -> b\nrow=10, col=6 -> b\nrow=10, col=7 -> b\nrow=10, col=8 -> b\nrow=10, col=9 -> b\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> b\nrow=10, col=12 -> b\nrow=10, col=13 -> b",

The objective is to navigate the grid effectively, collect ingredients, and avoid placing any items incorrectly. \n\n**State Analysis:**\n- Adjacent Cells:\n  - Up (7, 4): Empty\n  - Down (9, 4): Empty\n  - Left (8, 3): Wall\n  - Right (8, 5): Empty\n  \n- There are resources I need to obtain, such as the boiling water, which is located downwards at (5, 4).\n\n**Next Steps:**\nSince I currently have possible moves above, below, and to the right, I can consider my next move carefully. To maximize my potential for creating dishes, I should aim to reach the boiling water to transform raw pasta into \"pastainplace.\" \n\n**Chosen Action:**\nI will move downwards to (9, 4) to get closer to the boiling water, as this position is clear and will allow for interaction with the boiling water in the next turns.\n\n```Action:3```\n\nThis action is consistent with the strategy of prioritizing ingredient transformation for the dish. Next, I expect to find myself in a position where I can evaluate my options for interacting with the boiling water.",
