    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested strategy.\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle and strategy genre**, likely incorporating elements similar to those found in games like \"Sokoban\" or \"Lost in Space.\" Players need to manipulate various elements in the environment to achieve specific goals while navigating potential obstacles.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features several types of sprites, such as the avatar (player character), boxes, boulders, holes, and goals. They exhibit different interactions.\n- **Interactions**: Each sprite type has unique interactions. For example:\n  - The avatar can transform some types of boulders but steps back from walls.\n  - Boxes \"bounce forward\" when interacting with the avatar.\n  - Boulders and boxes can also affect each other's status (e.g., some can become \"normal,\" \"master,\" or \"stopping\").\n- **Movement**: There appears to be no direct movement input for the avatar, but interactions with objects affect the dynamics of play.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal (indicated by the sprite 'goal') while managing the other sprites to avoid losing points. Successfully navigating these sprites is crucial to prevent negative interactions, such as falling into holes or depleting the avatar count.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins by ensuring the count of the `targetBoulder` is zero within a set time limit (1500 units).\n- **Losing**: The game ends unfavorably if:\n  - The avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n  - The `master` sprite count reaches zero.\n  - A timeout occurs with the conditions unmet.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Carefully manage the boulders and boxes to navigate around the obstacles efficiently. Since boxes can interact with walls and other sprites causing \"undo\" scenarios, positioning must be strategic.\n2. **Avoid Holes**: The holes cause significant point losses. Players should keep the avatar away from them and navigate the board carefully to prevent falling in.\n3. **Transformations**: Utilize the interactions creatively, especially transforming boulders from normal to stopping states. Use these transformations to your advantage to manipulate the boulders' positions strategically.\n4. **Puzzle Solving**: Treat the game as a complex puzzle. Each action can create a ripple effect in subsequent moves, so consider the long-term impact of each interaction.\n5. **Time Management**: Stay aware of the time limit as it ticks down while executing moves. Plan moves ahead and think several steps in advance to prevent unnecessary backtracking.\n\nThis strategy will help players efficiently navigate the puzzle and achieve the goal while avoiding loss conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> $\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> a\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> #\nrow=8, col=10 -> #\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

The primary objective is to manipulate the surrounding sprites to navigate to the goal ('g') while managing resources effectively.\n\nIn this scenario, let's analyze the surrounding area:\n\n- Row 7: at column 8, we have the avatar ('a'), while column 9 has a box ('b'), and column 10 has a boulder ('%').\n- There is another goal ('@') at (2, 11), but it seems quite far up.\n- The immediate goal appears to be to maneuver around the box and the boulder.\n\nSince the last action didn't seem to change the avatar position significantly, I must take a directional action to move strategically.\n\nTo begin with, moving **down** one step to (8, 8) is an option since that area is an empty floor (not further obstructed).\n\nHence, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will allow me to explore the map better without falling into holes, and hopefully position myself for the next moves towards reaching the goal.",
