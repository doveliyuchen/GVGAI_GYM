Its rules and interactions suggest that players must solve challenges using strategy and logical thinking, rather than relying on combat or reflex skills that are common in action games.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different sprites represent various objects in the game, such as walls, boulders, boxes, and the avatar. Each type of sprite has unique properties and interactions.\n- **Interactions**: Numerous interactions dictate how the avatar (the player character) and other sprites affect each other, including movement, transformation, and scoring actions.\n- **Transformations and Attracting Gaze**: The ability to transform one sprite into another or attract their attention adds depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to think about positioning and timing carefully.\n  \n#### Objective\nThe primary objectives are:\n- Navigate through the level by manipulating the environment using the available sprites.\n- Reach the goal (`g`) in the level while avoiding hazards (like `hole`).\n- Collect or manage certain boulders while ensuring that undesired conditions (like losing the avatar or causing unwanted transformations) don't occur.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning the Game**: You win if the count of `targetBoulder` sprites goes to zero.\n- **Losing the Game**: You lose if:\n  - The avatar count drops to zero.\n  - The `master` sprite count drops to zero (implying you fail to use strategic sprites).\n  - You run out of time (based on the specified timeout).\n  \n- There are scoring dynamics where interacting with holes and the avatar incur negative points, while reaching the goal or boulders can add points.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before acting, think ahead about how each move affects the sprites around you. Consider potential transformations and interactions deeply since many interact with each other.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Goals**: Identify the target boulders required to win and focus your efforts on managing them effectively. Make movements that protect them while trying to remove other hazards.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of holes and ensure your avatar doesn\u2019t get caught in a cycle that could cause its loss. \n\n4. **Box Usage**: Use boxes strategically to trigger interactions with other sprites; for instance, bouncing boxes can manipulate boulders or manipulate the environment to your advantage.\n\n5. **Work Gradually**: Break down the level into manageable parts. Tackling small sections systematically can prevent overwhelming maneuvers leading to mistakes.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the time while you play. Focus on faster, but still thoughtful movements to reach your objectives before timing out.\n\n7. **Engage with Sprites Wisely**: Use the different interactions to your advantage; for example, attracting gaze or transforming sprites in a way that leads to beneficial outcomes.\n\nBy considering these strategies, players can navigate the level more effectively, manage the sprite interactions, and achieve the goal within the parameters provided.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\nboulderm floor -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> f\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> a\nrow=7, col=11 -> $\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> b\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> #\nrow=8, col=10 -> #\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",
