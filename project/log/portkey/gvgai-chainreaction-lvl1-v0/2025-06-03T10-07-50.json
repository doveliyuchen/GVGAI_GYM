Players navigate a 2D environment while solving puzzles using various mechanics involving movement and object manipulation.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites/Entities**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character (a yeti), capable of interacting with other sprites like boxes and boulders.\n   - **Boulders and Boxes**: These are movable objects that can interact with walls and other sprites in significant ways (e.g., transforming into different types).\n   - **Walls**: Act as barriers that the avatar cannot pass through.\n   - **Holes and Goals**: Represent endpoints for gameplay; finding the goal scores points, while falling into holes results in penalties.\n\n2. **Transformations**: Different types of boulders can transform based on interactions with the avatar or other boulders/boxes, which adds complexity to the player's strategy.\n\n3. **Scoring System**: Players can earn or lose points based on interactions with the goal, holes, boulders, and other entities. Falling into a hole penalizes the player, while reaching the goal awards points.\n\n4. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in a loss if the avatar sprite count reaches zero or if the master sprite count reaches zero without completing the goal.\n   - The win condition is met when the target boulder is reduced to zero.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to move your avatar efficiently through the level to eliminate or manipulate other entities (especially boulders) while striving to reach the goal and avoid holes. Players must manage their interactions to succeed.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: Achieved by eliminating all target boulders and successfully reaching the goal.\n- **Loss**: Occurs if the avatar is eliminated (sprite count reaches zero) or if time runs out (timeout limit is reached).\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Interactions**: Before moving, assess the layout, identifying which boulders can be manipulated to clear a path to the goal. Understanding how keys interact with other sprites is crucial.\n   \n2. **Avoid Holes**: Since falling into a hole results in a score penalty, it\u2019s vital to proceed carefully and observe the terrain to avoid missteps.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Efficiently**: Use boxes to manipulate boulders strategically. Instead of jumping or potentially falling into holes, push or activate boxes to create pathways or clear regions around obstacles.\n\n4. **Transformation Utilization**: Pay attention to which boulders can be transformed into more advantageous types. Utilize these mechanics to create opportunities rather than obstacles.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer and plan actions accordingly. Efficient movement and decision-making will help in adhering to the time limit while achieving the game's objectives.\n\nThrough a combination of strategic planning and careful movement, players should be able to navigate through the challenges presented by this puzzle platformer effectively.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> b\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> a\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> #\nrow=8, col=10 -> #\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> b\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "In the current game state, my avatar ('a') is situated in row 4, column 9. There are several interchangeable entities in the vicinity such as boxes and boulders to manipulate, as well as holes to avoid.\n\nFollowing the strategy previously outlined, the immediate aim should be to avoid falling into the holes below and effectively utilize any boxes to create pathways or manipulate boulders. The tiles further to the left or right of my current position need careful assessment to avoid potential hazards.\n\nConsidering the directional actions and the fact that my avatar hasn't moved yet, a planned move to the left (ACTION_LEFT - 1) could be effective. It will position me nearer to exploring the boulders and boxes that may be strategically beneficial while ensuring I maintain a safe distance from holes.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nI expect that moving left will give me a better view of the area and the possibility of engaging with boxes and potentially clearing pathways toward the goal.",
