Players likely need to manipulate objects in the environment to achieve a certain goal.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites such as:\n   - **Avatar**: Controlled character (the player).\n   - **Boxes**: Movable objects that can interact with the avatar and other elements.\n   - **Boulders**: Static or dynamic obstacles that may have different states (normal, stopping, etc.).\n   - **Goals and Holes**: These represent objectives or hazards.\n\n2. **Interactions**: The game includes numerous interactions that dictate how various sprites react when they come into contact with each other. Important interactions include transforming boulders\u2019 types (e.g., from normal to stopping) and manipulating the placement of boxes.\n\n3. **Scoring**: Players gain or lose points based on actions they take, particularly concerning where boulders and the avatar end up (e.g., reaching goals gives points, while falling into holes results in penalties).\n\n4. **Termination Conditions**: The game ends when:\n   - The avatar gets eliminated (e.g., if its count reaches zero).\n   - All target boulders are successfully managed (count reaches zero).\n   - The master boulders are tracked (must also reach zero).\n   - A time limit is reached.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to maneuver the various objects (instead of just the avatar) effectively so that all the **target boulders** are removed or transformed to win the game. The player must avoid losing the avatar while managing the boulders because certain interactions can lead to a loss of points or game termination.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: Achieved by eliminating all target boulders.\n- **Loss**: Occurs in several scenarios:\n  - The avatar is eliminated.\n  - The master sprite counts reach zero without winning.\n  - The player runs out of time.\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Observe the position of all boulders and boxes first. Each move can have cascading effects, especially with boulders changing states. Strategically place boxes in locations that prevent boulders from rolling into holes or walls unnecessarily.\n\n2. **Prioritize Targets**: Focus on eliminating target boulders first. Use interactions to transform them as needed. Try to control their movement so they don\u2019t get stuck or fall into holes, which would cost points.\n\n3. **Stay Clear of Hazards**: Avoid leading the avatar or boulders into holes, as they lead to significant point losses. Monitor their paths especially when manipulating blocks and boulders.\n\n4. **Timing**: Keep an eye on the time limit, ensuring that you're not spending too long plotting moves. Sometimes it might be worth making a less optimal move quickly rather than taking too much time debating a perfect sequence.\n\n5. **Experiment with Interactions**: Utilize the various transformations and interactions between objects creatively. Not all boulder types are equally mobile; understanding how they react with walls and boxes can help in making progress.\n\nBy keeping the above strategies in mind, players can navigate the puzzle effectively, optimize their moves, and increase their chances of winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> b\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> @\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> $\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> a\nrow=3, col=7 -> %\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> #\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> #\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> b\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> %\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> $\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> @\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> @\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> %\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> b\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> #\nrow=8, col=9 -> #\nrow=8, col=10 -> #\nrow=8, col=11 -> &\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

Your immediate goal is to manage the target boulders and avoid any hazards that could cause a loss in points.\n\n1. **Analyzing the current surroundings**:\n   - You have a master boulder ('$') at position (3, 2).\n   - A normal boulder ('%') is located at (3, 4) and another one at (7, 10).\n   - There are multiple boxes ('b') that may be used strategically to block potential holes ('#').\n   - Goals (@) are present at (2, 11), (6, 14), and (7, 5).\n\n2. **Considering the mechanics**:\n   - The normal boulders can be pushed or manipulated, if there are no walls.\n   - Your avatar can interact with boxes to manipulate their positions which can indirectly influence the movement of the boulders.\n\n### Strategy:\n- To eliminate the target boulders, I will aim to reposition them before they get stuck or drop into a hole.\n- Since my avatar is adjacent to the normal boulders, I need to consider the next move carefully to push one of them while ensuring I do not lean them towards any holes.\n\nGiven that the avatar position will not change if I rotate it, I need to take a meaningful action that will allow me to ultimately maneuver towards the goal of eliminating target boulders.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move **UP** (to (2, 6)), as this does not place me directly next to any hazards, and allows further exploration for strategic interaction with other sprites.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis move aligns with the overall strategy, allowing me to explore options for pushing the boulders toward goals while keeping the avatar safe from hazards.",
