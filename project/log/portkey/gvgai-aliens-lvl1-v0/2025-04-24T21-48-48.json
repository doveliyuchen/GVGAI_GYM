The game tracks the number of aliens that reach the base's position.\n- **Scoring**: Players earn points by shooting down aliens and using SAMs effectively against bombers.\n- **Survival**: The game includes win and loss conditions:\n  - **Win Condition**: No aliens must reach the base (`MultiSpriteCounter stype1=portal stype2=alien limit=0 win=True`).\n  - **Loss Condition**: If the avatar (player's spaceship) is eliminated (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins if no aliens reach the base.\n- The player loses if the avatar is destroyed or eliminated.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Prioritize Defense**: Focus on stopping the aliens from reaching the base. Since the loss condition hinges on the avatar's survival as well as preventing alien ingress, managing these threats effectively is crucial.\n   \n2. **Utilize Power-Ups Wisely**: Given that there's a score change mechanism when you successfully defend (or attack with SAMs), ensure efficient use of available missiles and SAMs to maximize score and decrease enemy numbers.\n\n3. **Monitor Aliens\u2019 Spawn Rate**: Pay attention to the different spawn rates and types of aliens from the portals. You can predict the influx and prepare your defenses accordingly.\n\n4. **Avoid Collisions**: Stay alert to avoid interactions with bombs and enemy aliens to prevent penalties or score decreases.\n\n5. **Positioning**: Stay mobile and position the avatar strategically on the playing field to ensure a clear shot at incoming enemies while maintaining a safe distance from threats.\n\n6. **Learn Enemy Patterns**: If there are patterns to how enemies spawn or move, adapting a play style to preemptively respond could improve overall performance and scoring.\n\nBy maintaining focus on the primary objectives outlined and developing a rhythm to gameplay actions, players can enhance their success in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nbackground -> '.'\nbackground base -> '0'\nbackground portalSlow -> '1'\nbackground portalFast -> '2'\nalienGreen -> '@'\nbase -> '#'\nsam -> '$'\nalienGreen bomb -> '%'\nbomb -> '&'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n...$..........................\n..............................\n.@@....#.....#.....#...#####..\n.@@a..........................\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\n...........\n@@.........\n@@.........\na..$.......\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.#.........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.#.........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.#.........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.#.........\n.#.........\n.#.........\n.#.........\n.#.........\n...........\n...........",
