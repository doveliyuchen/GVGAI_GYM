    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and layout, here's an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements reminiscent of old-school arcade games. Players navigate through a maze-like environment, avoiding traps and collecting items, which suggests strategic movement and resource management.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various entities in the game, including the avatar (player character), traps (spike, fire), exits, collectibles (chips), and different types of footwear that provide protection against specific hazards (ice and fire).\n- **Movement**: Players control the avatar's movement across a grid, interacting with walls, collectibles, exits, and traps.\n- **Collectibles**: Players collect chips and footwear for points and protection respectively.\n- **Traps**: There are traps (spikes and fire) that will 'kill' the avatar unless it has the appropriate footwear.\n- **Exit Condition**: The exit (green door) can be accessed to complete the level, provided the avatar has not been eliminated and the exit is still present. \n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to collect points by gathering chips, while progressing towards the exit. The player must navigate through levels without running out of time or health (which is affected by traps).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the exit before conditions such as time (500 ticks) run out or the player avatar is eliminated (limited to 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is killed by traps or if the time runs out.\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Plan Movement**: Carefully plan routes to avoid traps while maximizing movement toward collectible chips and the exit. Mapping out safe paths before making moves can avoid costly mistakes.\n   \n2. **Collect Resources**: Target the chips and footwear as they provide points and necessary protections. Prioritize collecting fireboots when near fire traps, and ice shoes when near ice traps.\n\n3. **Manage Risk**: Assess the risk versus reward when approaching traps; if you don\u2019t have the right footwear, avoid those zones to ensure you stay alive longer.\n\n4. **Exit Visibility**: Keep track of the exit position as you collect items. Always plan to move towards it as soon as it's safe to minimize the risk of running out of time.\n\n5. **Save Time**: Since there\u2019s a time limit, be efficient in movements. Avoid wandering too much and aim to collect items that lead directly to the exit.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, manage resources, and work toward completing the game successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nchip -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nfire -> '$'\nfireboots -> '%'\nice -> '&'\niceshoes -> '*'\ntrap -> 'c'\nwall -> 'e'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> e\nrow=0, col=1 -> e\nrow=0, col=2 -> e\nrow=0, col=3 -> e\nrow=0, col=4 -> e\nrow=0, col=5 -> e\nrow=0, col=6 -> e\nrow=0, col=7 -> e\nrow=0, col=8 -> e\nrow=0, col=9 -> e\nrow=0, col=10 -> e\nrow=0, col=11 -> e\nrow=0, col=12 -> e\nrow=0, col=13 -> e\nrow=0, col=14 -> e\nrow=0, col=15 -> e\nrow=1, col=0 -> e\nrow=1, col=1 -> e\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> @\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> e\nrow=1, col=8 -> e\nrow=1, col=9 -> e\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> @\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> #\nrow=1, col=15 -> e\nrow=2, col=0 -> e\nrow=2, col=1 -> e\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> e\nrow=2, col=4 -> e\nrow=2, col=5 -> e\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> e\nrow=2, col=8 -> e\nrow=2, col=9 -> e\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> e\nrow=2, col=12 -> e\nrow=2, col=13 -> e\nrow=2, col=14 -> e\nrow=2, col=15 -> e\nrow=3, col=0 -> e\nrow=3, col=1 -> e\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> e\nrow=3, col=4 -> %\nrow=3, col=5 -> e\nrow=3, col=6 -> $\nrow=3, col=7 -> $\nrow=3, col=8 -> $\nrow=3, col=9 -> $\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> $\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> e\nrow=3, col=14 -> c\nrow=3, col=15 -> e\nrow=4, col=0 -> e\nrow=4, col=1 -> e\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> e\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> e\nrow=4, col=6 -> e\nrow=4, col=7 -> e\nrow=4, col=8 -> e\nrow=4, col=9 -> @\nrow=4, col=10 -> e\nrow=4, col=11 -> e\nrow=4, col=12 -> e\nrow=4, col=13 -> e\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> e\nrow=5, col=0 -> e\nrow=5, col=1 -> &\nrow=5, col=2 -> &\nrow=5, col=3 -> &\nrow=5, col=4 -> &\nrow=5, col=5 -> &\nrow=5, col=6 -> &\nrow=5, col=7 -> e\nrow=5, col=8 -> e\nrow=5, col=9 -> e\nrow=5, col=10 -> e\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> e\nrow=6, col=0 -> e\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> e\nrow=6, col=3 -> e\nrow=6, col=4 -> e\nrow=6, col=5 -> e\nrow=6, col=6 -> &\nrow=6, col=7 -> e\nrow=6, col=8 -> e\nrow=6, col=9 -> e\nrow=6, col=10 -> e\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> e\nrow=6, col=13 -> e\nrow=6, col=14 -> e\nrow=6, col=15 -> e\nrow=7, col=0 -> e\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> @\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> e\nrow=7, col=6 -> &\nrow=7, col=7 -> &\nrow=7, col=8 -> &\nrow=7, col=9 -> &\nrow=7, col=10 -> &\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> e\nrow=8, col=0 -> e\nrow=8, col=1 -> e\nrow=8, col=2 -> e\nrow=8, col=3 -> e\nrow=8, col=4 -> e\nrow=8, col=5 -> e\nrow=8, col=6 -> a\nrow=8, col=7 -> e\nrow=8, col=8 -> e\nrow=8, col=9 -> e\nrow=8, col=10 -> e\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> e\nrow=8, col=13 -> e\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> e\nrow=9, col=0 -> e\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> .\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> .\nrow=9, col=8 -> .\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> .\nrow=9, col=12 -> .\nrow=9, col=13 -> .\nrow=9, col=14 -> .\nrow=9, col=15 -> e\nrow=10, col=0 -> e\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> e\nrow=10, col=3 -> e\nrow=10, col=4 -> e\nrow=10, col=5 -> e\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> e\nrow=10, col=8 -> e\nrow=10, col=9 -> e\nrow=10, col=10 -> .\nrow=10, col=11 -> e\nrow=10, col=12 -> e\nrow=10, col=13 -> e\nrow=10, col=14 -> .\nrow=10, col=15 -> e\nrow=11, col=0 -> e\nrow=11, col=1 -> .\nrow=11, col=2 -> e\nrow=11, col=3 -> .\nrow=11, col=4 -> e\nrow=11, col=5 -> e\nrow=11, col=6 -> .\nrow=11, col=7 -> e\nrow=11, col=8 -> e\nrow=11, col=9 -> e\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> e\nrow=11, col=12 -> e\nrow=11, col=13 -> e\nrow=11, col=14 -> e\nrow=11, col=15 -> e\nrow=12, col=0 -> e\nrow=12, col=1 -> .\nrow=12, col=2 -> e\nrow=12, col=3 -> .\nrow=12, col=4 -> .\nrow=12, col=5 -> @\nrow=12, col=6 -> .\nrow=12, col=7 -> .\nrow=12, col=8 -> c\nrow=12, col=9 -> .\nrow=12, col=10 -> .\nrow=12, col=11 -> @\nrow=12, col=12 -> .\nrow=12, col=13 -> .\nrow=12, col=14 -> *\nrow=12, col=15 -> e\nrow=13, col=0 -> e\nrow=13, col=1 -> e\nrow=13, col=2 -> e\nrow=13, col=3 -> e\nrow=13, col=4 -> e\nrow=13, col=5 -> e\nrow=13, col=6 -> e\nrow=13, col=7 -> e\nrow=13, col=8 -> e\nrow=13, col=9 -> e\nrow=13, col=10 -> e\nrow=13, col=11 -> e\nrow=13, col=12 -> e\nrow=13, col=13 -> e\nrow=13, col=14 -> e\nrow=13, col=15 -> e",
