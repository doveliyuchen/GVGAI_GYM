It involves navigating a 2D environment filled with obstacles and challenges, as indicated by the presence of various sprites and interactions.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Immovable Objects:** These include the 'floor', 'hole', 'wall', and 'coin', which provide structure and boundaries within the level.\n   - **Passive Objects:** The 'box' acts as an interactive element that can be moved around.\n   - **Moving Avatar:** The player controls an avatar (likely a knight) that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Chaser Enemy:** The 'piranha' sprite actively seeks and harms the avatar, adding a layer of threat.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can collect coins and interact with boxes, moving them and utilizing them to navigate the environment.\n   - 'Switches' can spawn walls, potentially helping or obstructing the avatar\u2019s progress.\n   - The piranha chases the avatar, leading to a loss condition if caught.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends if the avatar is killed (by the piranha or falling into a hole) or if the total number of boxes reaches zero.\n   - A time limit exists (1000), which adds urgency to the gameplay.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to clear all boxes from the level (indicated by the SpriteCounter for boxes) while avoiding threats from the environment (piranhas, holes) and successfully collecting coins to score points.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by making all boxes disappear from the screen.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The player loses if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero) or if the time runs out.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Avoid Threats:** Always be aware of the piranha's movement and plan routes that minimize interaction with it.\n2. **Box Management:** Carefully move boxes to clear paths and strategically use them to reach coins and switches.\n3. **Use Switches Wisely:** Activate switches to spawn walls where necessary for defensive measures against the piranha or to block off dangerous areas.\n4. **Collect Coins:** Focus on collecting coins as you navigate (they provide score and may hint at beneficial paths).\n5. **Plan Your Moves:** Since there is a time limit, plan movements ahead of time to ensure you complete the puzzle efficiently.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies, players can enhance their gameplay experience and maximize their chances of successfully completing the level.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> w\nrow=2, col=18 -> w\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> w\nrow=2, col=22 -> w\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> a\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> .\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> w\nrow=4, col=18 -> w\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> w\nrow=4, col=22 -> w\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> 0\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> 0\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=5, col=21 -> .\nrow=5, col=22 -> .\nrow=5, col=23 -> .\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, we note the following key elements in the environment based on the provided layout:\n\n- **Player's Avatar Position:** Currently located at (row=3, col=12).\n- **Immovable Objects:** The walls and holes (represented by 'w' and '0') restrict movement.\n- **Passive Objects:** There are movable boxes ('1' located at (row=5, col=13)).\n- **Coins:** Collectible items are located at (row=2, col=23) and (row=3, col=23).\n- **Switch:** A switch is present at (row=1, col=23).\n\n### Goals Based on the Current State:\n1. **Avoid the Piranha:** No immediate threat from piranhas is visible in the current area.\n2. **Clear Boxes:** There is one box available to clear (at position (row=5, col=13)).\n3. **Collect Coins:** Coins are present nearby, which should be collected.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) is not valid as it would hit a wall.\n- Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) leads to empty space at (row=3, col=13).\n- Moving down (ACTION_DOWN) would lead to empty space at (row=4, col=12).\n- Moving up (ACTION_UP) would lead into a wall.\n\nGiven the above information, the most strategic action would be moving right to (row=3, col=13) to create a path towards coins while preventing stagnation in movement.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action leads the avatar right toward an empty spot (row=3, col=13) which can potentially facilitate collecting a coin later while keeping options for vertical movements open.",
