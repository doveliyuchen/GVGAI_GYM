The player navigates through a level while solving puzzles, avoiding enemies, and interacting with various objects.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Immovable** elements (floor, hole, wall, coin, switch): These provide structure to the level and have certain interactions with the player.\n   - **Passive** elements (box): These can be moved and used in interactions, but do not actively pursue the player.\n   - **Chaser** (piranha): An active enemy that targets the player.\n   - **MovingAvatar (player)**: Represents the player character who can move, interact with objects, and must avoid hazards.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins for points and push boxes around.\n   - If the avatar is caught by the piranha, it\u2019s game over.\n   - Interacting with switches can spawn walls or affect the environment dynamically.\n   - Boxes play a pivotal role in both solving puzzles (e.g., bouncing and blocking) and facilitating movement (e.g., preventing falls into holes).\n\n#### Objective:\nThe player\u2019s goal is to eliminate all box sprites (since the win condition states that reaching a limit of zero boxes leads to win) while avoiding being killed by the piranha and navigating through the level effectively.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: Achieved by removing all box sprites from the level.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar is killed (e.g., by the piranha).\n  - The avatar runs out of life (or identical to the previous point with the avatar limit set to zero).\n  - Time runs out before achieving the win condition.\n\n#### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Navigation**:\n   - Carefully navigate the level to avoid the piranha. Keep an eye on its cooldown and plan movements accordingly.\n   \n2. **Box Management**:\n   - Use boxes to block the piranha or create pathways to reach areas you need to explore or reach. Remember that boxes can bounce the avatar and can be subject to undo actions if mishandled against walls.\n   \n3. **Coin Collection**:\n   - Prioritize collecting coins for scoring; this may enhance the score or help with further progression, depending on game dynamics.\n   \n4. **Switch Utilization**:\n   - Use switches strategically to manipulate the environment\u2014such as spawning walls to block the piranha or create new paths.\n   \n5. **Timing**:\n   - Keep track of time. Given the timeout condition, ensure progress is made efficiently to avoid losing by running out of time.\n\n6. **Piranha Awareness**:\n   - Maintain distance from the piranha and use obstacles effectively to create a safe path while drawing its movement away from you.\n\nOverall, meticulous planning and strategic movement are key to overcoming the challenges presented in the level. Keep interactions in mind, leverage the environment effectively, and balance the collection of items with the need for safety against hazards.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> w\nrow=2, col=18 -> w\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> w\nrow=2, col=22 -> w\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> s\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> .\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> w\nrow=4, col=18 -> w\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> w\nrow=4, col=22 -> w\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> a\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> 0\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=5, col=21 -> .\nrow=5, col=22 -> .\nrow=5, col=23 -> .\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",

There is a box ('@') located at (5, 13), and a hole ('0') at (5, 14).\n3. The goal is to eliminate all box sprites from the level while avoiding the piranha.\n\nConsidering the layout, I notice that the box at (5, 13) is positioned right next to the hole at (5, 14). Moving the box into the hole would eliminate it, moving towards my win condition.\n\nTo accomplish this, the most effective action would be to move the avatar to the right (to (5, 13)) and then push the box into the hole (to (5, 14)). However, since I need to first move to the box position I will perform the action to the right first.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action moves the avatar closer to the box while setting up for the next action to push it into the hole. I expect to see the avatar at position (5, 13) after executing this action, which aligns with my strategy of eliminating the box to progress toward the win condition.",
