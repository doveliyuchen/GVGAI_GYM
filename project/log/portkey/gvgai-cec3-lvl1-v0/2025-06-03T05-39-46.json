    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle platformer genre**, where players navigate through a level filled with obstacles and challenges, utilizing mechanics such as moving, collecting items, and managing threats.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Different objects represented as sprites, such as walls, holes, boxes, coins, a switch, a moving avatar, and a chasing enemy (piranha).\n- **Avatar Controls**: The player controls an 'avatar' (indicated as a knight), which can move, interact, and jump.\n- **Interactivity**:\n  - The avatar can collect coins to increase their score.\n  - Activation of switches changes the environment by spawning new walls.\n  - Boxes can be used to bounce forward or to potentially clear paths and achieve specific goals if positioned correctly.\n  - The movement of walls adds a dynamic element, forcing the player to strategize their steps.\n  - The piranha chases the avatar, introducing a timed threat that the player must avoid.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to clear all boxes from the level. Collecting coins and managing switches is likely essential to achieve this goal. The challenge lies in avoiding the piranha and effectively navigating the obstacles, including walls and holes.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by having no boxes left on the screen (SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0) or if a timeout occurs (1000 units of time).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Focus on Coin Collection**: Start by collecting as many coins as possible since they may provide points and could be essential for future mechanics or level designs.\n2. **Manage Threats**: Constantly be aware of the piranha's position and its cooldown. Use boxes against it when possible to bounce away or create distance.\n3. **Utilize Switches Wisely**: Activate switches to spawn walls judiciously to block the piranha's path or to clear the area, ensuring you have safe places to navigate.\n4. **Plan Box Movement**: Boxes are crucial; strategically position them to avoid falling into holes or being trapped by walls. Use them to create platforms or barriers against moving walls or the piranha.\n5. **Environment Awareness**: Be conscious of the entire environment layout and plan your path before making any moves. This planning will help in managing the dynamic challenges posed by moving walls and the piranha.\n\nBy understanding these elements and planning your moves, players can optimize their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> w\nrow=2, col=18 -> w\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> w\nrow=2, col=22 -> w\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> s\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> .\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> w\nrow=4, col=18 -> w\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> w\nrow=4, col=22 -> w\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> a\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> 0\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=5, col=21 -> .\nrow=5, col=22 -> .\nrow=5, col=23 -> .\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",
