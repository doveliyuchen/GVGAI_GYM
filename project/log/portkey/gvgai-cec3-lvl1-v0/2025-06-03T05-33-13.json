    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** with elements of adventure. It involves navigating through an environment, interacting with various objects to solve puzzles, and avoiding or combating threats.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - Various sprites such as `floor`, `hole`, `box`, `wall`, `coin`, `switch`, and `piranha` interact in specific ways.\n   - The `avatar` represents the player and can move, bounce off boxes, collect coins, and must avoid getting killed by the `piranha`.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins and boxes, which can affect movement and score.\n   - When the avatar hits a 'switch', it can manipulate the environment, like spawning walls.\n   - Some interactions can lead to death, such as falling into a hole or being attacked by the piranha.\n\n3. **Enemy Behavior**:\n   - The `piranha` chases the avatar and has a cooldown period, making it crucial for the player to plan movements carefully.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal of the game is to:\n- Collect all the boxes (as indicated by the `SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True` win condition).\n- Collect coins for score while avoiding deadly interactions.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: Collecting all the boxes (`SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0`).\n- **Loss Conditions**: \n  - If the avatar is killed by a piranha or falls into a hole, the game ends unfavorably (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False`).\n  - A timeout, likely indicating you have a limited time to complete the level (`Timeout limit=1000 win=False`).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Map**: Take time to explore the level layout. Understand where the piranha moves and how to effectively avoid it.\n\n2. **Prioritize Box Collection**: Focus on collecting boxes as they are necessary for winning. Look for strategic placements that allow you to access boxes without being harmed.\n\n3. **Use the Switches Wisely**: Engaging the switches can change the environment, potentially creating new pathways or blocking the piranha. Use them to create safe routes, especially if multiple paths are available at once.\n\n4. **Keep a Safe Distance from Piranhas**: Since the piranha is a chaser, plan your movements to stay away and keep an eye on its cooldown period to determine when it's safe to cross certain areas.\n\n5. **Coin Collection**: While collecting coins is not mandatory for win conditions, they can enhance your score. If they are easily accessible, grabbing them could lend to a higher final score.\n\n6. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Make sure you efficiently gather boxes and plan your moves to avoid running out of time.\n\n7. **Trial and Error**: If you encounter particularly difficult sections, don\u2019t hesitate to retry after observing the piranha's patterns or the positions of boxes.\n\nBy following these strategies while keeping aware of your surroundings and other sprites, you can enhance your chances of achieving the objectives and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> w\nrow=2, col=18 -> w\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> w\nrow=2, col=22 -> w\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> #\nrow=3, col=11 -> s\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> .\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> #\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> w\nrow=4, col=18 -> w\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> w\nrow=4, col=22 -> w\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> a\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> 0\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=5, col=21 -> .\nrow=5, col=22 -> .\nrow=5, col=23 -> .\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",
