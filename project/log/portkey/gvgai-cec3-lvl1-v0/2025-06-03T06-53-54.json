    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules provided, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, win/loss conditions, and a suggested overall strategy.\n\n### Game Genre:\nThis game appears to fall into the **puzzle/platformer** genre. Players navigate a level, manipulate objects, and avoid enemies while achieving certain goals.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Floor**: Serves as the primary surface for movement.\n   - **Hole**: A deadly pit where falling leads to losing a sprite (or life).\n   - **Box**: Manipulatable object for bouncing and solving puzzles.\n   - **Wall**: Impassable boundary that can interact with other sprites.\n   - **Coin**: Collectible for scoring points.\n   - **Switch**: Triggers specific effects or spawns walls.\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that moves around the level.\n   - **Piranha**: An enemy that chases the avatar, presenting a threat.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can pick up coins for scoring.\n   - The avatar can bounce off boxes, enabling further movement or solving puzzles.\n   - Encountering the piranha results in a loss of a life.\n   - Boxes can be used strategically to manipulate the environment (e.g., placing a box on a hole for scoring).\n   - Switches can be used to trigger the spawning of walls, altering the layout.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal of the game is to manipulate the environment (boxes and switches) to clear all boxes from the level while collecting coins for additional points. The player must survive encounters with the piranha and traverse the level wisely.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when all boxes have been eliminated (SpriteCounter for boxes reaching zero).\n- **Loss Conditions**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar\u2019s SpriteCounter reaches zero (meaning the avatar is killed).\n  - A timeout occurs (1000 turns).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Collect Coins**: Focus on gathering coins as you navigate to boost your score.\n2. **Avoid Piranhas**: Keep an eye on the piranha's movements and avoid direct engagement. Use environmental features like walls or boxes to block its path.\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Carefully manipulate the boxes. Use them to bounce backward, if needed, to evade threats or reach higher ground or new areas.\n4. **Activate Switches**: Utilize switches strategically to manage wall placements that can aid or hinder movement further in the maze.\n5. **Plan Moves**: Visualize potential paths through the level, taking into account the layout and where threats exist, to ensure efficient gameplay.\n6. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer; plan your moves to avoid being rushed as you work towards the win condition.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, avoid losses, and achieve the win condition successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=0, col=13 -> w\nrow=0, col=14 -> w\nrow=0, col=15 -> w\nrow=0, col=16 -> w\nrow=0, col=17 -> w\nrow=0, col=18 -> w\nrow=0, col=19 -> w\nrow=0, col=20 -> w\nrow=0, col=21 -> w\nrow=0, col=22 -> w\nrow=0, col=23 -> w\nrow=0, col=24 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> .\nrow=1, col=17 -> .\nrow=1, col=18 -> .\nrow=1, col=19 -> .\nrow=1, col=20 -> .\nrow=1, col=21 -> .\nrow=1, col=22 -> .\nrow=1, col=23 -> s\nrow=1, col=24 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=13 -> w\nrow=2, col=14 -> w\nrow=2, col=15 -> w\nrow=2, col=16 -> w\nrow=2, col=17 -> w\nrow=2, col=18 -> w\nrow=2, col=19 -> w\nrow=2, col=20 -> w\nrow=2, col=21 -> w\nrow=2, col=22 -> w\nrow=2, col=23 -> #\nrow=2, col=24 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> a\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> .\nrow=3, col=17 -> .\nrow=3, col=18 -> .\nrow=3, col=19 -> .\nrow=3, col=20 -> .\nrow=3, col=21 -> .\nrow=3, col=22 -> w\nrow=3, col=23 -> #\nrow=3, col=24 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=13 -> w\nrow=4, col=14 -> w\nrow=4, col=15 -> w\nrow=4, col=16 -> w\nrow=4, col=17 -> w\nrow=4, col=18 -> w\nrow=4, col=19 -> w\nrow=4, col=20 -> w\nrow=4, col=21 -> w\nrow=4, col=22 -> w\nrow=4, col=23 -> #\nrow=4, col=24 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> 0\nrow=5, col=13 -> @\nrow=5, col=14 -> 0\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> .\nrow=5, col=17 -> .\nrow=5, col=18 -> .\nrow=5, col=19 -> .\nrow=5, col=20 -> .\nrow=5, col=21 -> .\nrow=5, col=22 -> .\nrow=5, col=23 -> .\nrow=5, col=24 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=13 -> w\nrow=6, col=14 -> w\nrow=6, col=15 -> w\nrow=6, col=16 -> w\nrow=6, col=17 -> w\nrow=6, col=18 -> w\nrow=6, col=19 -> w\nrow=6, col=20 -> w\nrow=6, col=21 -> w\nrow=6, col=22 -> w\nrow=6, col=23 -> w\nrow=6, col=24 -> w",

You can also scout for coins, and it appears that there are coins located at (row 2, col 23), (row 3, col 23), and (row 4, col 23); however, there's a wall directly to the right of your avatar which prevents any immediate movement in that direction.\n\nTo reposition the avatar and get closer to collecting coins or preparing for future strategies, moving left (to (row 3, col 13)) is the most logical step since it will help you try to overcome obstacles in your path.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of maneuvering your position to optimize movement toward coins and avoiding threats effectively.",
