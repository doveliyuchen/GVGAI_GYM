Players control an avatar navigating through a grid-based layout filled with various obstacles, resources, and doors that require specific keys to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** There are different types of sprites (floor, water, mud, fire, keys, doors, etc.) each serving distinct functions. \n- **Avatar Movement:** The player controls an avatar that can collect resources like keys, boots, and chips while navigating through the level.\n- **Interactions:** The player can interact with various sprites to collect resources, unlock doors, and avoid dangers (e.g., mud kills the avatar, and water can transform crates to mud).\n- **Scoring:** Players score points by collecting chips, resources, and successfully navigating the level.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to reach the exit, represented by the 'exit' sprite, while managing resources (keys, boots, etc.) to unlock doors.\n- Completing the objective involves avoiding deaths from interacting with specific sprites (like mud, water, and fire) and strategically using resources.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they successfully reach the exit before the avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar sprite count reaches zero.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:** Prioritize collecting keys and boots early in the game. Make sure you know how many of each key you\u2019ll need to pass through doors.\n\n2. **Observation:** Pay attention to the surrounding sprites to avoid unnecessary interactions. For example, stay clear of water without flippers, fire without fire boots, and be cautious near mud.\n\n3. **Plan Your Path:** Map out a route from the start point (A) to the exit (X). Identify which keys are necessary to progress through each section and collect them before approaching the doors.\n\n4. **Crate Utilization:** Make use of crates to bounce forward, which can help with maneuvering around obstacles. Be aware of how interactions with crates can change the environment (like transforming them into mud).\n\n5. **Keep Track of Resources:** Always keep an eye on your resources (like chips and keys) and the interactions required at each door. Ensure you have enough of the required resource before attempting to pass through a door.\n\n6. **Avoid Unreachable Areas:** Steer clear of areas that may lead to a resource being locked away or impossible to collect due to losing your avatar, such as low health area interactions.\n\n7. **Exiting the Level:** Once you reach the exit, ensure that you've collected as many points as possible before stepping into it.\n\nBy focusing on strategic resource management and planning your route effectively, you can successfully navigate the game while maximizing your score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\ngreendoor -> 'e'\ngreenkey -> 'f'\nreddoor -> 'g'\nredkey -> 'r'\nwall -> 'w'\nwater -> 'y'\nyellowdoor -> 'b'\nyellowkey -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> y\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> f\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> y\nrow=2, col=5 -> y\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> c\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> g\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> y\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> y\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> #\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> a\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> r\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> y\nrow=10, col=6 -> y\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> @\nrow=10, col=10 -> @\nrow=10, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> @\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> @\nrow=11, col=6 -> @\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w",

Surrounding tiles are:\n- Up (8, 5): `.` (floor)\n- Down (10, 5): `y` (water)\n- Left (9, 4): `.` (floor)\n- Right (9, 6): `.` (floor)\n\n### Objectives and Strategy\n1. **Resource Management:** I haven't collected any significant resources yet, but I have to avoid water since I currently lack flippers.\n2. **Observation:** I can move freely onto the floor tiles (represented by `.`), but moving down to (10, 5) into the water is not advisable without flippers.\n3. **Plan My Path:** From my current location, I could move up, left, or right. However, going down is not an option.\n\n### Evaluating Movement Options\nSince moving down is off the table and moving left doesn't seem to provide immediate benefit, my best options are to either move up toward (8, 5) or right towards (9, 6). Moving either way keeps me safe from hazardous routes.\n\n### Decision\nI will move **UP** to (8, 5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up should position me on a safe tile while allowing me to assess further options in subsequent moves.",
