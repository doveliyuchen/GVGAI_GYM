Players control an avatar in a tile-based environment, solving challenges by interacting with various sprites (objects) to progress through levels.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites (Objects)**: The game includes various types of sprites that interact in specific ways. Key sprites include:\n  - **Immovable Obstacles**: Water, mud, fire, walls, etc.\n  - **Keys and Doors**: Different colored keys (red, blue, green, yellow) are required to open matching colored doors.\n  - **Resources**: Chips are collectible resources, and special items like boots and flippers enhance movement capabilities.\n  - **Avatar**: The player's character moves around the grid-based layout and interacts with other sprites.\n\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can collect keys and chips, and engage with obstacles which can lead to rewarding or detrimental effects. For example, water transforms crates into mud or avatars can be killed by stepping into mud or fire without the required resources.\n\n- **Winning Conditions**: The player wins by reaching the exit sprite while ensuring that the avatar remains alive by managing resources effectively.\n\n#### Objectives\n- **Collect Resources**: Gather keys, chips, boots, and flippers to navigate through the level and overcome obstacles.\n- **Navigate Challenges**: Solve puzzles related to moving through doors, dodging deadly sprites (like mud and fire), and figuring out how to transform crates for strategic advancement.\n- **Reach the Exit**: Successfully navigate to the exit sprite by avoiding hazards and utilizing collected resources.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win**: Reach the exit sprite while the avatar is still alive.\n- **Lose**: Avatar is killed (e.g., by stepping in mud or fire unprotected); failure to reach the exit before the avatar's counter (lives) runs out.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Start by exploring the level layout to identify key locations for resources like keys, chips, and protective equipment (boots, flippers).\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Pay close attention to the types and limits of resources needed to open doors. Collect keys before attempting to use the doors. \n\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Stay clear of mud and fire unless equipped with the appropriate items (flippers or fireboots). Strategically position your movements to minimize risk of encountering these hazards.\n\n4. **Utilize Interaction Mechanics**: Make use of crates to potentially block or interact with gates. Experiment with how items affect each other based on their interactions for puzzle-solving.\n\n5. **Timing and Planning**: Carefully plan movements, especially when engaging with doors that require certain keys. Be mindful of the avatar\u2019s life counter while dynamically reacting to the level's challenges.\n\n6. **Puzzle Solving**: Look for ways to manipulate the environment to your advantage. For example, transforming crates by moving them into water to unlock further paths or clearing potential hazards.\n\nBy adopting this strategic approach, players can effectively navigate the levels while maximizing their chances of survival and simultaneously gathering resources to achieve their objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\ngreendoor -> 'e'\ngreenkey -> 'f'\nreddoor -> 'g'\nredkey -> 'r'\nwall -> 'w'\nwater -> 'y'\nyellowdoor -> 'b'\nyellowkey -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> y\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> f\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> y\nrow=2, col=5 -> y\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> c\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> g\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> y\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> y\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> #\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> a\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> r\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> y\nrow=10, col=6 -> y\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> @\nrow=10, col=10 -> @\nrow=10, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> @\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> @\nrow=11, col=6 -> @\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w",
