The avatar can accumulate various resources but has limits on what it can carry.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective of the game is to reach the 'exit' sprite while navigating through obstacles, collecting keys and chips, and avoiding hazards. Players will need to unlock doors and gates by collecting the respective keys to progress through the level.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins the game when the avatar reaches the exit sprite, which increases the score by 5. If the avatar's sprite count drops to zero, the player loses.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The avatar can die if it encounters hazardous sprites (like mud, fire, or if it tries to cross water without the required flippers).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Collect all available resources (chips and boots) promptly. Use resources wisely, especially the keys, as you may need to unlock specific doors to progress.\n\n2. **Key Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize collecting the keys needed to open the gates and doors. Remember that you can only hold one of each key type.\n\n3. **Hazard Navigation:**\n   - Avoid hazards like mud and water unless equipped with the necessary resources. Ensure you have fireboots before approaching fire.\n\n4. **Planning Your Route:**\n   - Before moving, assess the level layout and plan your route. Consider the number of doors, the location of keys, and the nearest exit to minimize backtracking.\n\n5. **Use of Crates:**\n   - Crates can serve as obstacles or as tools for bouncing or blocking paths. Experiment with them to alter your movement or to solve puzzles.\n\n6. **Exploration:**\n   - Fully explore each environment, as hidden sprites or resources may be critical for unlocking paths.\n\n7. **Scoring:**\n   - Whenever possible, prioritize collecting chips to maximize your score for each resource you gather.\n\nThe game unfolds as a combination of strategy, resource management, and problem-solving as you traverse through the level to reach the exit while avoiding potential hazards. Familiarize yourself with each type of door and their corresponding keys to streamline your progress.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\ngreendoor -> 'e'\ngreenkey -> 'f'\nreddoor -> 'g'\nredkey -> 'r'\nwall -> 'w'\nwater -> 'y'\nyellowdoor -> 'b'\nyellowkey -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> y\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> f\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> y\nrow=2, col=5 -> y\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> c\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> g\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> y\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> y\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> a\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> r\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> y\nrow=10, col=6 -> y\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> @\nrow=10, col=10 -> @\nrow=10, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> @\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> @\nrow=11, col=6 -> @\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w",
