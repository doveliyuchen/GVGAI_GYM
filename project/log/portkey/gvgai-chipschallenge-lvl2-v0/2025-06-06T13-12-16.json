The player navigates a grid-based environment filled with obstacles, keys, and various interactive elements.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Movement:** The player controls an avatar that moves across a grid layout.\n2. **Interaction with Sprites:** The avatar interacts with various immovable sprites like walls, doors, and environmental hazards (water, mud, fire). Each sprite has specific effects on the avatar and their resources.\n3. **Resource Collection:** The player can collect keys and other resources. Players must manage a limited number of resources (like chips and keys) to interact with gates and doors.\n4. **Transformations:** Certain interactions can lead to transformations of sprites (e.g., water transforming to mud).\n5. **Resource Requirements:** Specific doors require specific keys to open (e.g., red door for red key).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to navigate the environment, solve puzzles involving resources, and eventually reach the **exit** of the level. The player must collect keys and avoid hazards to achieve this objective.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit sprite before the avatar is defeated.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends in a loss if the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:** \n   - Focus on collecting keys, resources (like chips), and power-ups (such as boots and flippers). Prioritize collecting these resources as they will be necessary for progressing through the level and overcoming obstacles.\n   - Keep an eye on the limits for keys and resources, as running out could lead to being stuck.\n\n2. **Navigation and Exploration:**\n   - Explore the grid systematically. Check the surroundings for potential resources and hidden paths.\n   - Be cautious around hazardous tiles like mud, fire, and water, ensuring you have the required items (flippers or fire boots) to pass through or avoid dying.\n\n3. **Interaction with Doors:**\n   - Pay attention to doors that require keys. Only approach them if you have the necessary resource, as attempting to do so without it will result in the avatar being defeated.\n   - Organize resource management so that you can keep some keys handy for accessing doors later in your exploration.\n\n4. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Plan your moves to avoid hazards. Know where danger lies (e.g., mud instantly kills the avatar).\n   - Use the crates effectively \u2013 they can help you bounce forward and might be used tactically to manipulate your surroundings.\n\n5. **Level Exit:**\n   - Always track your score and the avatars' status concerning the exit. Ensure that you haven\u2019t used up important resources before heading toward the exit.\n   - Try to finish levels efficiently by avoiding unnecessary encounters with enemies or hazards.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can improve their chance of successfully navigating the levels and ultimately reaching the exit while maintaining the necessary resources.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\ngreendoor -> 'e'\ngreenkey -> 'f'\nreddoor -> 'g'\nredkey -> 'r'\nwall -> 'w'\nwater -> 'y'\nyellowdoor -> 'b'\nyellowkey -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> y\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> f\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> y\nrow=2, col=5 -> y\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> c\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> g\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> y\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> y\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> a\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> r\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> y\nrow=10, col=6 -> y\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> @\nrow=10, col=10 -> @\nrow=10, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> @\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> @\nrow=11, col=6 -> @\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w",
