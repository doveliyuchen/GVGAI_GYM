Players navigate through a grid-based map, solving challenges and interacting with objects (sprites) to progress.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Movement:** The player controls an avatar that moves across a grid.\n- **Resources:** The avatar can collect resources like keys, boots, and chips to unlock doors and gain advantages.\n- **Interactions:** The avatar can interact with various environmental elements, including doors, walls, crates, and hazardous terrain (water, mud, fire).\n- **Transformation:** Some objects can transform (e.g., crates can turn into mud when interacting with water).\n- **Collectibles:** Players gather resources to aid progression and score points.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to navigate the maze-like level, collect keys, avoid obstacles, and ultimately reach the exit. Players must manage their resources to unlock doors and escape.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the exit sprite (exit) with the avatar.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar is killed (sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Resource Management:** Prioritize collecting keys, as they allow access to different doors, each of which can lead to useful items or continue your progress towards the exit.\n2. **Avoid Hazards:** Keep an eye out for deadly sprites (water, mud, fire) and ensure you have the proper items (flippers, fireboots) to negate their dangers.\n3. **Use Crates Strategically:** You can bounce off crates and move them to manipulate the environment to your advantage. Utilize them for blocking water or fire hazards, or to create pathways.\n4. **Plan Your Path:** Before moving, analyze your possible actions and their outcomes. Consider how collecting keys and items will affect your ability to navigate around gates and doors that require these resources.\n5. **Maximize Scoring:** Collect chips and try to complete the level efficiently. Some interactions may yield score bonuses, so think about how to optimize your route for scoring points while progressing toward the exit.\n6. **Check Each Room:** Make sure to explore thoroughly to collect all available resources before moving toward the exit. Checking each room allows you to evaluate threats and the possible resources that can be collected to assist in your mission.\n7. **Save Resources for Doors:** When approaching colored doors, ensure you have the corresponding keys to proceed safely without losing resources.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate through the challenges presented by the game, manage their resources, and improve their chances of reaching the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\ngreendoor -> 'e'\ngreenkey -> 'f'\nreddoor -> 'g'\nredkey -> 'r'\nwall -> 'w'\nwater -> 'y'\nyellowdoor -> 'b'\nyellowkey -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> y\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> f\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> y\nrow=2, col=5 -> y\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> c\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> g\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> y\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> y\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> #\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> a\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> r\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> y\nrow=10, col=6 -> y\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> @\nrow=10, col=10 -> @\nrow=10, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> @\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> @\nrow=11, col=6 -> @\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w",
