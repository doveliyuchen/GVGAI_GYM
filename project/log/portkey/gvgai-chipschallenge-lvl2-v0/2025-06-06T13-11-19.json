Players navigate through a maze-like environment, which is filled with obstacles and keys that need to be used strategically to progress.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Interactions:** The game consists of various immovable and movable sprites (objects) such as walls, water, fire, keys, doors, and a player's avatar. Players can interact with these sprites in various ways (e.g., collecting keys, navigating through doors).\n2. **Collectibles:** Players collect resources (chips, keys, boots) that can affect gameplay. For example, keys allow access through specific colored doors, while boots enable movement in different terrains.\n3. **Environmental Hazards:** Certain elements like water and mud can harm the player (the avatar) if they don't have the appropriate resources (like flippers or boots).\n4. **Exit Mechanic:** The objective is to reach the exit, collecting resources along the way and managing them wisely.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective of the game is to guide the avatar to the exit (\"x\") while collecting as many chips and keys as possible. Players must strategize their use of collected keys to unlock doors of the corresponding color (red, blue, green, yellow) while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won if the avatar reaches the exit sprite with at least one chip (as indicated by the score change on the exit interaction).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated (SpriteCounter for avatar equals 0).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Resource Collection:** Prioritize collecting chips and keys as they will improve your score and unlock paths to progress.\n2. **Hazard Awareness:** Be cautious of hazards like mud, water, and fire. Ensure that the avatar collects boots or flippers to avoid getting killed by these hazards.\n3. **Key Management:** Pay attention to the doors you encounter and manage your keys sensibly. Remember which keys you have and which doors are available. Avoid using keys unnecessarily.\n4. **Use Crates for Navigation:** Crates can be used to bounce and maneuver through the level more effectively. Look for opportunities to use these to your advantage.\n5. **Plan Your Route:** Before making a move, consider the layout of the level to anticipate future interactions and potential hazards. Aim to minimize backtracking by planning your key utilization.\n\nUsing these strategies, players should be able to navigate through the various obstacles, collect necessary resources, and ultimately reach the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor -> '~'\nmud floor -> 'm'\nfire floor -> 'x'\nredkey floor -> 'r'\ngreenkey floor -> 'g'\nbluekey floor -> 'b'\nyellowkey floor -> 'y'\nreddoor floor -> '1'\ngreendoor floor -> '2'\nbluedoor floor -> '3'\nyellowdoor floor -> '4'\ngate floor -> '-'\nchip floor -> 'c'\nexit floor -> 'e'\nflippers floor -> 'f'\nfireboots floor -> 'i'\ncrate floor -> 'd'\nfloor -> '.'\nchip -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nexit -> '$'\nfire -> '%'\nfireboots -> '&'\nflippers -> '*'\ngate -> 'c'\ngreendoor -> 'e'\ngreenkey -> 'f'\nreddoor -> 'g'\nredkey -> 'r'\nwall -> 'w'\nwater -> 'y'\nyellowdoor -> 'b'\nyellowkey -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> @\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> w\nrow=1, col=4 -> *\nrow=1, col=5 -> y\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> %\nrow=1, col=10 -> f\nrow=1, col=11 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> w\nrow=2, col=2 -> e\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> y\nrow=2, col=5 -> y\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> c\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> #\nrow=3, col=4 -> b\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> @\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> w\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> w\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> g\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> a\nrow=6, col=6 -> y\nrow=6, col=7 -> d\nrow=6, col=8 -> y\nrow=6, col=9 -> @\nrow=6, col=10 -> &\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> w\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> w\nrow=7, col=7 -> w\nrow=7, col=8 -> w\nrow=7, col=9 -> w\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> #\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> #\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> .\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> .\nrow=9, col=5 -> .\nrow=9, col=6 -> .\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> r\nrow=9, col=9 -> .\nrow=9, col=10 -> .\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> %\nrow=10, col=2 -> %\nrow=10, col=3 -> w\nrow=10, col=4 -> w\nrow=10, col=5 -> y\nrow=10, col=6 -> y\nrow=10, col=7 -> w\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> @\nrow=10, col=10 -> @\nrow=10, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> @\nrow=11, col=2 -> @\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> @\nrow=11, col=6 -> @\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> .\nrow=11, col=9 -> .\nrow=11, col=10 -> .\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> w\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w",
