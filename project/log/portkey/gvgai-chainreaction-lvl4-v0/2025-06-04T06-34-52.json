Players manipulate various sprites (blocks, boulders, and walls) to navigate through levels, likely resembling features from games like *Sokoban* where players push boxes to reach goals.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game includes different types of sprites, each with unique properties and interactions.\n  - **The Avatar:** Represents the player\u2019s character.\n  - **The Goal:** A destination for the avatar to reach.\n  - **Boulders & Boxes:** Dynamic elements that interact with each other and the environment.\n  - **Holes:** Hazards that incur a score penalty when interacted with.\n  - **Walls and Floors:** Obstacles that influence movement and strategy.\n\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can transform boulders into different states by interacting with them.\n  - Boxes can be pushed around, and their interaction with walls or holes results in specific effects.\n  - The performance and movement of entities may change based on their interactions; for example, certain boulders can \"attract gaze\" or change states when influenced by the avatar.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The **primary objective** is to reach the goal (`g`) while avoiding hazards (holes).\n- Players gain points by successfully navigating boulders to the goal while pushing boxes into the right places.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The avatar has a limited number of interactions or moves (SpriteCounter limit), and the game ends if they run out or if they enter a hole.\n\n**Win Conditions:**\n- Achieve a point total by successfully reaching the goal and managing to clear the target boulders.\n- The completion of the level is marked by having the target boulders reduced to zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Moves:** Always assess the layout before making moves. Understand how each sprite interacts with others and predict the outcome of your actions.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Goals:** Focus on reaching the goal (`g`) while minimizing interactions that could lead you into holes, especially if it costs points. \n\n3. **Manipulate the Environment:**\n   - Use boulders strategically to clear pathways or access the goal without falling into holes.\n   - Understand the transformation abilities of boulders and use them to your advantage, such as converting normal boulders to master boulders when necessary.\n\n4. **Score Management:** \n   - Keep track of score changes during play. Avoid interactions that lead to negative scores, particularly with holes.\n   - Aim to build points through safe gameplay rather than rushing into interactions that could be detrimental.\n\n5. **Control Movement:** Maintain control over the avatar's movement to avoid stepping back unintentionally. This includes being cautious while moving near walls or where boulders are involved.\n\n6. **Test Before Execute:** If unsure of the outcome of an interaction, consider simulating the move first in your mind. \n\nIn summary, careful planning, understanding your strategic options, and managing risks are crucial for successfully navigating levels while maximizing scores in this puzzle-platformer game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\nfloor mboulderm -> '*'\nboulderm floor -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> %\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> a\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar (indicated by 'a') is positioned at (2, 7) on the map. The surrounding tiles include:\n\n- Walls (&) blocking most sides.\n- A box ('b') below at (6, 7).\n- Various empty spaces (.) around the area.\n- A hole ('#') located at (7, 7) directly below the avatar.\n\nGiven the rules, the primary strategy should focus on navigation towards the goal while avoiding hazards such as holes. The immediate goal is to find a way to reach the goal state or move in a manner that clears obstacles while not entering the hole.\n\nHowever, the avatar cannot move directly downwards (action toward the hole, which is not advisable), and the walls prevent movement in several other directions. \n\nSince the last action might not have led to a movement (and it\u2019s crucial to get all sprite interactions right), I will take the step to rotate and check if subsequent movements would place the avatar in a more advantageous position.\n\nSince the preferred direction for the next meaningful action would be moving left (to avoid the hole), and to reassess the layout:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect that moving left will be beneficial, allowing me to analyze my next steps without direct hazard risks.",
