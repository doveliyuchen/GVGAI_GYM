Players need to think critically about how to manipulate different sprites and their interactions within a confined space.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Player (Avatar):** Controls a character that can interact with various objects (boxes, boulders, walls).\n   - **Obstacles (Walls, Holes):** These represent boundaries that the avatar cannot cross without a consequence. Falling into holes results in a score penalty and may lead to losing the game.\n   - **Goals and Targets:** Achieving goals requires moving specific blocks or boulders to particular locations, indicated as \u2018g\u2019 for goal, while also managing 'targetBoulder' placements.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar interacts with boxes, boulders, and walls to change their states (e.g., transforming types, bouncing), which affects movement strategies.\n   - Moving objects can lead to score changes, and failing to manage objects correctly can result in significant penalties.\n\n3. **Scoring System:**\n   - Players gain or lose points based on sprite interactions. For example, reaching the goal with a boulder gives points, while falling into holes results in penalties.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the 'goal' (g) by manipulating the available blocks and boulders (masterBoulder, normalBoulders, etc.), while avoiding penalties from falling into holes and losing the avatar. Properly managing the different states and interactions of boulders will be crucial to achieving this goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - The player wins if the number of targetBoulders reaches zero.\n  - Timed play: The game also includes a timeout condition where the player needs to think quickly and efficiently.\n  \n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The game is lost if the avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n  - A significant point penalty occurs for falling into holes and failing to control the boulders effectively.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Before moving the avatar, assess the layout to decide the positions of boulders and boxes.\n   - Determine which boulders are crucial to move towards the goal and how they can be transformed.\n\n2. **Boulder Management:**\n   - Use the interactions effectively to keep boulders moving in desired directions while avoiding interactions that may lead to stepping back or penalties.\n   - Focus on transforming boulders into their forms that allow them easier access to the goal.\n\n3. **Avoiding Penalties:**\n   - Stay clear of holes and ensure that your movements do not lead to accidentally stepping back into places that result in negative score changes.\n   - Be cautious of walls that can block your avatar and create unnecessary penalties.\n\n4. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer and prioritize moves that lead straight to achieving the goal while ensuring the avatar remains safe.\n\n5. **Iterative Approach:**\n   - If a particular series of moves leads to a setback, backtrack as necessary to explore alternative routes before time runs out.\n\nBy utilizing smart strategies to navigate interactions, manage boulders, and avoid penalties, players can optimize their approach to achieving the game\u2019s objectives efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> a\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",
