The player must navigate through a level with obstacles and use specific mechanics to achieve goals, manipulate objects, and avoid dangers.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites and Movement**: The game features various sprites (such as 'avatar', 'boulders', 'boxes', etc.) that can interact with each other in specific ways. The player controls an 'avatar' that can move and interact with other sprites on a grid.\n- **Transformations**: Several sprites can transform into different types (like 'normalBoulder' and 'masterBoulder') based on interactions, indicating a mechanic of manipulating objects strategically.\n- **Kill Conditions**: Moving certain sprites (like the avatar or boulders) into 'holes' results in a score decrease, while moving 'boulders' into the 'goal' sprite results in a score increase.\n  \n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to maneuver the avatar to ensure that all 'targetBoulders' are dealt with (rendered inactive or removed) while maximizing points (potentially by moving boulders into the goal). \n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when the number of 'targetBoulders' present reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if:\n  - The avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches zero).\n  - The 'master' sprites are eliminated, or timeout occurs (though managing time doesn't seem to be a central feature beyond what it indicates).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Movements**: Given the interactivity of sprites, plan several moves ahead. Anticipate how your avatar interacts with each object to avoid accidentally falling into 'holes' or being pushed back unnecessarily.\n\n2. **Prioritize Boulders**: Focus on managing 'boulders' carefully. Use the transformation mechanics to shift 'normalBoulders' into more desirable forms (like 'stoppingBoulders') for control over their movement.\n\n3. **Create Pathways**: Since 'walls' are immovable, ensure your movements create pathways for your 'boulders' and 'boxes' so that you can maneuver them effectively without getting blocked.\n\n4. **Be Aware of Score Implications**: Since moving certain objects into 'holes' yields negative points, always calculate whether your actions might inadvertently lead to this outcome.\n\n5. **Observe Interactions**: Some interactions may reverse objects (undo actions); use this strategically to revert possible errors or to reorient boulders and boxes when stuck.\n\n6. **Time Management**: While there is a timeout condition, ensure your moves are both strategic and efficient to avoid losing due to time.\n\nBy carefully considering each sprite's interactions and planning movements around the map, players can navigate through challenges effectively, working towards clearing out 'targetBoulders' and reaching the end goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox floor -> 'b'\nnormalBoulder floor -> 'c'\nmasterBoulder floor -> 'm'\nhole floor -> '0'\ngoal floor -> 'g'\nfloor goal -> '@'\nfloor hole -> '#'\nfloor masterBoulder -> '$'\nfloor normalBoulder -> '%'\nwall -> '&'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> &\nrow=0, col=1 -> &\nrow=0, col=2 -> &\nrow=0, col=3 -> &\nrow=0, col=4 -> &\nrow=0, col=5 -> &\nrow=0, col=6 -> &\nrow=0, col=7 -> &\nrow=0, col=8 -> &\nrow=0, col=9 -> &\nrow=0, col=10 -> &\nrow=0, col=11 -> &\nrow=0, col=12 -> &\nrow=0, col=13 -> &\nrow=0, col=14 -> &\nrow=0, col=15 -> &\nrow=0, col=16 -> &\nrow=1, col=0 -> &\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> .\nrow=1, col=16 -> &\nrow=2, col=0 -> &\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> .\nrow=2, col=13 -> .\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> .\nrow=2, col=16 -> &\nrow=3, col=0 -> &\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> .\nrow=3, col=13 -> .\nrow=3, col=14 -> .\nrow=3, col=15 -> .\nrow=3, col=16 -> &\nrow=4, col=0 -> &\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> $\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> .\nrow=4, col=16 -> &\nrow=5, col=0 -> &\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> .\nrow=5, col=16 -> &\nrow=6, col=0 -> &\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> a\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> .\nrow=6, col=13 -> .\nrow=6, col=14 -> .\nrow=6, col=15 -> .\nrow=6, col=16 -> &\nrow=7, col=0 -> &\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> #\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> .\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> .\nrow=7, col=16 -> &\nrow=8, col=0 -> &\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> .\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> .\nrow=8, col=16 -> &\nrow=9, col=0 -> &\nrow=9, col=1 -> &\nrow=9, col=2 -> &\nrow=9, col=3 -> &\nrow=9, col=4 -> &\nrow=9, col=5 -> &\nrow=9, col=6 -> &\nrow=9, col=7 -> &\nrow=9, col=8 -> &\nrow=9, col=9 -> &\nrow=9, col=10 -> &\nrow=9, col=11 -> &\nrow=9, col=12 -> &\nrow=9, col=13 -> &\nrow=9, col=14 -> &\nrow=9, col=15 -> &\nrow=9, col=16 -> &",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game and determine the best next action, let's identify the avatar's position and nearby sprites.\n\n### Current Position:\n- Avatar ('a') is located at **(6, 7)**\n\n### Nearby Sprites:\n- Directly left (6, 6): empty floor (.)\n- Directly right (6, 8): empty floor (.)\n- Directly up (5, 7): empty floor (.)\n- Directly down (7, 7): hole (#)\n\n### Important Mechanics Considerations:\n- Since there's an empty floor in the left, right, and up directions, the avatar can move freely in those directions. \n- Moving down into the hole will result in a loss (as it negatively affects the score due to the hole).\n- There are boulders and the goal is located at (2, 7) as indicated by (@).\n\n### Action Plan:\nBased on the observations, the goal is to navigate the avatar without falling into the hole below. Since the avatar's position does not change regardless of the action taken, we need to ensure we move strategically into an available tile.\n\nGiven that we have three possible moves, the best action would be to move **up** to (5, 7) as it doesn't put the avatar in immediate danger and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to keep me safe and allow for maneuvering towards clearing the level.",
