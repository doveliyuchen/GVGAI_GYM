The `avatar` can push the `box` to bounce forward.\n  2. Landing on a `piranha` results in the avatar's elimination.\n  3. Boxes can be placed in holes or against walls for significant interactions.\n  4. Coins are collectible by the avatar for scoring points.\n  5. Switches potentially trigger the appearance of walls, altering the environment for the player.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main goal of the game is to eliminate all `box` sprites, as indicated by the win condition: \"SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True\". The player also collects coins for scoring.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win**: The player wins when all `box` sprites are removed from the level.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar is eliminated, with \"SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False\".\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before acting, analyze the positions of the `box` and how they can be manipulated to remove them from play (e.g., pushing them into holes).\n\n2. **Manage Risks**: Be cautious of the `piranha` \u2013 avoid direct paths where they can chase and eliminate the avatar. Use moving walls wisely for cover.\n\n3. **Utilize Coins**: While collecting coins is not the main objective, they contribute to your score, so collect them when safe and viable.\n\n4. **Use Switches Strategically**: Activate switches when it benefits the environment or if necessary to create barriers against the `piranha`.\n\n5. **Sequential Removal of Boxes**: Focus on eliminating boxes in a strategic order, using walls and the environment to guide them into holes without risking interactions with the `piranha`.\n\n6. **Adapt to Level Layout**: Each level has a particular structure; adapt your strategy to utilize the layout, such as walls for protection and optimal paths for pushing boxes.\n\nBy keeping these strategies in mind, players can navigate through levels effectively, maximize their scores, and ultimately achieve their objectives while avoiding elimination.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> 0\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To summarize the current state, my `avatar` (position `(5, 10)`) is surrounded by various entities: a box (`@`) is to the left at `(5, 9)`, an empty spot directly to the right at `(5, 11)`, and wall boundaries above and below. The objective is to eliminate all the boxes.\n\nGiven that I can push the box to the left into the hole at `(5, 8)`, this would be the ideal action to eliminate the box. Since this is a crucial move, I should push left first, then confirm if the action changes my position or game state.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow me to push the box into the hole and bring me closer to achieving my game objective of eliminating boxes while also managing the risk of piranhas.",
