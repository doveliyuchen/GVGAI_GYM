    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:** \nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer** or **maze-solving game**, where players navigate through a level, avoiding hazards and interacting with elements to progress.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:**\n  - The game uses different types of sprites (game elements) including immovable objects (like walls and floor), passive objects (boxes), and mobile avatars (the player's character).\n- **Interactions:**\n  - The avatar can interact with various sprites:\n    - Moving onto a wall causes a step back.\n    - Encountering a piranha results in a loss.\n    - Bouncing off boxes aids in movement.\n    - Boxes can destroy certain elements and contribute to scoring.\n    - Collecting coins increases the score.\n    - Activating switches alters the environment, specifically adding walls.\n  \n**Objective:**\n- The main objective is to **eliminate all boxes** (as indicated by the win condition concerning the 'box' sprite).\n- Collecting 'coins' may contribute to the player's score but doesn't seem to be essential for winning.\n  \n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins if all boxes are destroyed (SpriteCounter for 'box' sprite reaches 0).\n- The player loses if the avatar is eliminated (SpriteCounter for 'avatar' drops to 0).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify the walls, holes, boxes, switches, and where the piranha is located.\n\n2. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Stay away from the piranha. It has a cooldown period, so maneuver carefully to avoid being caught.\n\n3. **Use Boxes Wisely:**\n   - Bounce off boxes to reach areas you might not initially seem able to access. Keep in mind that hitting a box against a wall will reset your progress with that box, so plan your movements around that.\n\n4. **Utilize Coins:**\n   - Collect coins wherever possible to maximize your score, though your primary focus should be on the boxes.\n\n5. **Switch Activation:**\n   - Use switches to potentially create barriers that can help you navigate the level while keeping the piranha at bay. However, be cautious as activating a switch also removes it.\n\n6. **Strategize Box Elimination:**\n   - Work to get the boxes into the holes to eliminate them. Be tactical on how you maneuver around the level to ensure boxes can be eliminated without endangering your avatar.\n\n7. **Plan Movements:**\n   - Think ahead about each step. It's easy to get trapped or eliminated if you're not considering the positioning of both the piranha and the walls relative to your avatar movement.\n\nBy understanding the layout and interactions within the level, using strategic movement, and effectively managing the environment, you can successfully progress through the game while achieving your objective of eliminating all boxes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> 0\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
