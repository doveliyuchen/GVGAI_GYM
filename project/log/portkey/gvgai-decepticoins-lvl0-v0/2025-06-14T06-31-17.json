The mechanics involve navigating an avatar through a grid-based layout, solving puzzles related to moving and interacting with various types of blocks, walls, and enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers that cannot be moved.\n   - **Boxes**: Can be moved and used to interact with other sprites.\n   - **Coins**: Collectibles that increase your score.\n   - **Holes**: Dangerous zones that can kill the avatar if interacted with improperly.\n   - **Switches**: Trigger certain events when the avatar interacts with them.\n   - **Piranhas**: Enemies that chase the avatar, leading to a game over if caught.\n  \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect coins and activate switches.\n   - Boxes can bounce the avatar forward when interacted with and can also lead to death if pushed into holes.\n   - The piranha will kill the avatar on contact.\n   - The switches spawn wall obstacles, making them critical strategic points.\n\n#### Objective\nThe goal is to collect all boxes while avoiding traps (holes), defeating enemies (piranhas), and interacting with switches. You win the game by ensuring that all boxes are removed from play before your avatar is killed.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes (SpriteCounter limit=0) must be collected.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter limit=0), the game ends in failure.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Plan Moves Carefully**: Always think a few steps ahead. Each move can lead to different interactions with other sprites that might affect your survival.\n  \n2. **Use Switches Wisely**: Activating switches can drastically change the layout and may block or assist in your manipulations of the piranhas and walls. Determine the best moments to use them for advancing while avoiding traps.\n\n3. **Avoid Piranhas**: Keep an eye on the pursuing piranhas. If you know where they are, you can predict their movements and avoid them effectively. Consider using boxes to impede their progress or create escape routes.\n\n4. **Box Management**: Move boxes toward holes cautiously, knowing they can result in a score increase but also pose risks if you miscalculate. Use walls and other sprites strategically to maneuver boxes without trapping your avatar.\n\n5. **Practice Awareness of Sprite Limits**: Be mindful of the number of sprites (especially your avatar and boxes). Losing your avatar means game over, so don\u2019t rush without fully assessing each potential interaction.\n\n6. **Explore All Possible Paths**: Navigate the level thoroughly to find the best routes for collecting boxes and avoiding enemies. It might be beneficial to memorize or sketch a path to avoid retracing hazardous ground.\n\nBy executing this strategy, you can improve your chances of successfully navigating the challenges posed by the game while adhering to its rules and objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> 0\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
