It incorporates elements of puzzle-solving and resource management, requiring players to navigate through levels filled with obstacles and enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites:** \n   - **Floor:** Solid ground the avatar moves on.\n   - **Hole:** A dangerous area that can eliminate the avatar if entered.\n   - **Box:** An interactive object that can bounce the avatar forward and needs to be managed strategically.\n   - **Wall:** Impassable barriers that block movement.\n   - **Coin:** Collectible items that provide score points when collected by the avatar.\n   - **Switch:** An interactive object that can spawn walls when activated by the avatar.\n   - **Moving Avatar:** The player's character, which can navigate through the level.\n   - **Piranha:** An enemy that chases the avatar and eliminates it upon contact.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with various sprites, each providing a unique effect, such as moving backward upon hitting a wall or collecting coins and boxes for points.\n   - The switch can change the state of the environment (by spawning walls), influencing the gameplay.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends if the avatar encounters or is killed by enemies and the number of avatars reaches zero (player loses).\n   - The game is won when all boxes in play are successfully removed (indicating that the challenges or puzzles in the level have been completed).\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to manipulate the environment and navigate the avatar through the level while collecting coins and managing the boxes, ultimately leading to the removal of all boxes to win the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** All boxes must be removed from the level.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar must not be killed by the piranha or otherwise, leading to zero avatars remaining.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Observe the Layout:** Before making moves, examine the arrangement of the walls, holes, boxes, and the position of the piranha. Understanding the layout is crucial for making informed decisions.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes Wisely:** Use the bouncing effect of boxes to propel yourself forward while avoiding hazards. Moving boxes strategically can help clear paths or create safe routes.\n\n3. **Collect Coins:** Try to collect coins as you navigate through the level since they contribute to your score and add to the overall objective of collecting items.\n\n4. **Interactivity with Switches:** Activate switches only when it benefits your strategy. Be careful, as activating a switch can change the level layout, potentially blocking your path or creating new hazards.\n\n5. **Avoid the Piranha:** Maintain distance from the piranha and plan your movements to avoid confrontation. If the piranha approaches, use walls, boxes, and other obstacles to create distance.\n\n6. **Plan Your Moves:** Take each turn with intention. If you're unsure, wait and analyze the enemy's movement pattern before acting.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the game mechanics and structure, players can enhance their ability to complete levels successfully while maximizing their collectible score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> s\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> #\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> a\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> #\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
