    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided rules and descriptions, here's an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objective, win/loss conditions, and overall strategy:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game appears to fit into the **Puzzle/Platformer** genre, as it involves navigating a character (the avatar) around obstacles (walls, holes, boxes) while solving puzzles (interacting with switches, collecting coins) to achieve a specific goal.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various objects have different properties. The avatar can move, while walls and holes are immovable. Boxes act passively and can be used to bounce forward when interacted with.\n- **Interactions**: The game has defined interactions between sprites. For instance, stepping on a piranha results in the avatar's defeat, while hitting a box causes the avatar to bounce. Coins and holes can increase the score or eliminate sprites.\n- **Switches**: The avatar can interact with switches to spawn walls, changing the environment dynamically.\n- **Enemies**: The piranha sprite chases the avatar, adding a threat element that must be managed.\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to eliminate all box sprites (SpriteCounter limit=0), which would lead to winning the game. Along the way, collecting coins can provide additional points, although they do not seem to affect the win condition directly.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if all box sprites are eliminated.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's count reaches zero (i.e., the avatar is defeated).\n\n### Proposed Overall Strategy\n1. **Awareness of Enemy Movement**: Keep an eye on the piranha while navigating the level. Plan movement to avoid being caught by it\u2014use walls and boxes as barriers.\n   \n2. **Box Manipulation**: Utilize the bouncing mechanic with boxes strategically. Bouncing boxes into holes will eliminate them, helping to achieve the win condition.\n\n3. **Use of Switches**: Activate switches while considering the terrain they alter. Walls can block the piranha, provide safe paths, or change the layout of the level, aiding in safe box elimination.\n\n4. **Collect Coins Wisely**: While collecting coins can increase your score, prioritize eliminating boxes and staying alive. Only collect coins if it does not put you at risk.\n\n5. **Environment Navigation**: Familiarize yourself with the level layout. Use walls and floor configurations to create a path towards boxes while avoiding dead ends or trap areas that can lead to being cornered by the piranha.\n\n6. **Plan for Future Moves**: Always think a few steps ahead, especially when interacting with boxes or the piranha. Position yourself to bounce boxes or navigate around obstacles effectively.\n\nBy following these strategies, players should be able to navigate the game effectively and achieve the objective of eliminating all boxes while remaining cautious of threats like the piranha.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> s\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> #\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> a\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> #\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
