    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**, where players control an avatar that navigates a level, interacting with various objects to achieve an objective.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: \n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Floor, wall, and hole are solid structures. The floor supports the gameplay, walls act as barriers, and holes seem to be pitfalls, which may result in death.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: The box can be used to navigate or solve puzzles. It can interact with the avatar and walls.\n   - **Moving Avatar**: A knight character that the player controls.\n   - **Chaser**: The piranha acts as an enemy that pursues the avatar, adding a layer of danger to the gameplay.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with boxes, walls, and moving enemies (piranha).\n   - Coins and boxes can be destroyed (or collected) upon interaction with the avatar, providing a scoring mechanism.\n   - Switches can affect the layout by spawning walls, which may help block paths or create new routes.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main goal is to clear the level by utilizing the boxes effectively to reach a point where the **Box Counter** reaches zero (thus winning the level). Additionally, collecting coins increases the score.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the number of boxes reaches zero.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the number of avatars remaining drops to zero.\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid the Piranha**: Stay clear of the piranha to avoid losing avatars. Use platforms and walls for evasion.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: Utilize boxes to safely navigate the level:\n   - Bounce off walls to reach higher platforms.\n   - Place boxes over holes to avoid death (and score points).\n   - Ensure you do not trap boxes against walls unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Collect Coins**: Actively look for and collect coins to boost your score, if that is a goal in the level.\n\n4. **Maximize Switch Usage**: Use switches strategically to open new paths or block off areas, which can create advantageous scenarios to maneuver around enemies.\n\n5. **Plan Your Movement**: Always think a few steps ahead. Since the environment includes immovable walls and holes, pre-plan your route, considering the piranha\u2019s movement.\n\n6. **Execute Timely Actions**: Be aware of the cooldown for interactions, particularly when dealing with the piranha\u2014avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nBy following this strategy and understanding the game mechanics, players can effectively navigate the level, manage their resources (boxes), and ultimately achieve the objective of clearing the level successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> s\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> #\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> a\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> #\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, the avatar 'a' is located at (5, 8). Surrounded by the box '@' at (5, 9), a hole '0' at (5, 10), and a coin '#' at (5, 11). The key points to note are:\n\n1. **Box Interaction**: There is a box immediately to the right of the avatar, which can be moved.\n2. **Hole**: Directly to the right of the box, there is a hole. If the box is moved into the hole, it would effectively clear it out of play.\n3. **Coin Collection**: There is also a coin to the right of the hole, which can be collected if the avatar can successfully navigate around.\n\nGiven the game strategy to utilize boxes efficiently, as well as to collect coins while avoiding pitfalls, the immediate best action is to move the box away from the hole so I can collect the coin later. Therefore, I will first attempt to move the avatar RIGHT to push the box to (5, 9):\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action will allow the avatar to interact with the box to potentially position it better for future moves while also navigating the level effectively. I expect to see the box move so that I can subsequently collect the coin.",
