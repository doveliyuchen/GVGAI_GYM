This implies that players must manipulate their environment strategically to achieve this goal while avoiding dangers.\n\n**Game Mechanics**:\n1. **Sprites**: Different sprites have unique properties and interactions:\n   - **Immovable Sprites**: Includes the floor, walls, holes, and switches.\n   - **Passive Sprites**: Boxes, which can be moved and interacted with.\n   - **Moving Avatar**: The player-controlled character (knight) that can move and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Chaser Sprites**: Such as the piranha, which targets the player and can eliminate them upon contact.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The piranha can kill the avatar upon contact, creating a need for careful movement.\n   - Boxes can be bounced forward when the avatar interacts with them, and can cause death if they fall into holes.\n   - Coins provide a point score and can also be collected alongside the primary goal of removing boxes.\n   - Switches can cause walls to spawn behind the avatar, adding a layer of strategic gameplay and unpredictability.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions**:\n- **Win**: The player wins if they manage to remove all boxes from the level.\n- **Loss**: The player loses if the avatar is killed (i.e., there are no player sprites left).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Assess the Environment**:\n   - Before taking any action, survey the level layout to understand the placement of walls, holes, boxes, coins, and the enemy piranha.\n\n2. **Avoid Enemy Contact**:\n   - Keep a safe distance from the piranha and plan movements to evade it. Utilize the layout to create barriers or create movements that increase the distance between the avatar and the piranha.\n\n3. **Utilize Boxes Wisely**:\n   - Move boxes strategically to either push them towards holes (to remove them) or use them as barriers against the piranha. Remember that boxes can bounce when hit, so plan your movements accordingly.\n   - Ensure boxes are not moved into positions where they block your path or trap you alongside the piranha.\n\n4. **Switch Interaction**:\n   - Use switches with care. Activating switches can spawn walls that may either assist in movement or hinder it, so predict the outcome carefully before interacting.\n   - Turning on switches when necessary can create a path towards removing boxes or obtaining coins.\n\n5. **Collect Coins**:\n   - Collecting coins can not only give points but may also help with gaining other benefits or bonuses throughout the game.\n\n6. **Plan Each Move**:\n   - Think several steps ahead, especially when interacting with moving objects like boxes. Consider how their movements will affect both the avatar\u2019s safety and the goal of removing all boxes.\n\nBy focusing on these strategic points, players can effectively navigate the level and work towards winning the game while minimizing the risks of losing their avatar.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> 0\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",

There is also a hole (represented by '0') at (5, 8) to the left of the box. The goal is to remove all boxes from the level while avoiding any dangers such as the piranha (represented by 'e').\n\nIn this situation, it would be strategic to move the box to the left into the hole, which would remove the box from the level. \n\n### Actions:\n- The action to move the avatar left (to position (5, 9)) is necessary for pushing the box left into the hole. Thus, I will choose:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will examine the outcome of the current positioning and allow for the box to be moved. My expectation is to successfully remove the box by placing it into the hole, aligning with the strategy of using available boxes effectively.",
