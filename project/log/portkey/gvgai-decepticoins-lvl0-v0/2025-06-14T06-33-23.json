    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nThe game appears to be a **puzzle-platformer**. This genre combines elements of puzzle-solving with platforming mechanics, where players must navigate a space while solving challenges presented by the environment.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game utilizes a variety of sprites, including:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Such as walls, holes, coins, and switches.\n  - **Passive Sprites**: Boxes that can be interacted with by the avatar.\n  - **Moving Sprites**: The player-controlled avatar and a piranha enemy that chases the avatar.\n\n- **Interactions**: Key interactions include:\n  - The avatar can collect coins for points and interact with boxes to bounce forward.\n  - A piranha chases the avatar and will eliminate it on contact.\n  - Boxes can be used strategically to avoid the piranha or to access other parts of the level.\n  - Switches can trigger changes in the level, such as spawning walls.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to maneuver through the level to collect coins and manage boxes, while avoiding the piranha, with the ultimate goal of depleting the number of available boxes to reach a win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Deplete the number of boxes to zero to win the game.\n- **Loss Condition**: If the avatar is killed (by running into the piranha), the game is lost.\n\n#### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Avoid the Piranha**: Prioritize evading the piranha as it can eliminate the avatar quickly. Stay vigilant about its cooldown before it can chase again.\n   \n2. **Utilize Boxes Effectively**: Use boxes to bounce forward to access different parts of the level. Be mindful of interactions with walls to avoid regenerating barriers that could corner the avatar.\n\n3. **Collect Coins**: Aim to collect coins whenever safe. Since each coin collected contributes to the score, they also add some incentive for exploration and careful movement.\n\n4. **Interact with Switches Strategically**: Use switches to manipulate the environment, such as spawning walls strategically to block the piranha or create safe passages.\n\n5. **Plan Movements**: Before moving, assess potential routes that allow for box and coin collection while maintaining a safe distance from the piranha. Consider box placement and how they might activate or affect other sprites.\n\nBy carefully planning movements and leveraging the interactions between sprites, players can successfully navigate the level, collect coins, and reach the game's win condition without losing the avatar to the piranha.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> 0\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",

The objective of collecting coins (one is at (3, 1)) and avoiding dangers (like being chased by the piranha) needs to be carefully navigated.\n\n### Planned Action:\n- I will **move left** to interact with the box, which will allow me to bounce again and potentially move further along the platform toward coin collection or safe strategy relative to the surroundings.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy since I am manipulating a box, which is crucial for both avoiding the piranha and progressing toward the objective of collecting coins.",
