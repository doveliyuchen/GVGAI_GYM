This genre often features elements such as navigating levels, solving puzzles, and overcoming obstacles using specific mechanics. \n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game includes various sprites such as 'floor', 'holes', 'boxes', 'walls', 'coins', 'switches', an 'avatar', and a 'piranha'. Each sprite has specific attributes and behaviors:\n   - **Immovable Objects**: These include the floor, walls, holes, and coins. They do not move and serve as obstacles or collectible items.\n   - **Moving Avatar**: This is the character controlled by the player. It can interact with various elements in the environment.\n   - **Enemy**: The piranha chases the avatar and can eliminate it upon contact.\n   - **Boxes**: These can be pushed or bounced and are crucial for puzzle-solving.\n   - **Switches**: Interacting with switches changes the game state, likely by altering the level's layout.\n\n2. **Interactions**: These define how the avatar interacts with the other sprites:\n   - The avatar can pick up coins and boxes, interact with switches, and must avoid the piranha. \n   - Boxes can cause the player to \"bounce\" forward and can also affect other objects (e.g., if a box falls into a hole, it will result in a score gain).\n\n3. **Scoring**: Players gain points by collecting coins and potentially may trigger new elements (like walls) by interacting with switches.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to eliminate all boxes (indicated by the \"SpriteCounter stype=box limit=0 win=True\") while avoiding losing all avatars, which would lead to a loss (indicated by the \"SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0 win=False\").\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win**: All boxes must be eliminated (set to zero).\n- **Loss**: If the number of avatars is reduced to zero, the player loses the game.\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Navigate Wisely**: Move carefully through the level, avoiding the piranha. Since it has a cooldown, try to stay out of its line of attack and plan your moves carefully.\n\n2. **Use Boxes Strategically**: Use boxes to your advantage. Because they can be pushed or cause a bounce effect, they might be needed to create pathways or eliminate other threats.\n\n3. **Manage Switches**: Be attentive to how switches affect the environment. Interacting with switches may open up new paths, create new walls, or remove obstacles that could hinder progress.\n\n4. **Collect Coins**: Though collecting coins may not be necessary for winning, it can enhance your score and help you track your progress throughout the level.\n\n5. **Avoid Holes**: Ensure that boxes are not placed into holes unless it contributes positively to your strategy (like clearing multiple boxes at once).\n\n6. **Plan Moves**: Since actions like stepping back from walls are limited, carefully consider each move to avoid getting trapped or losing an avatar unnecessarily.\n\nBy applying these strategies while keeping an eye on both the obstacles and the goals, players can navigate the level successfully and achieve victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> s\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> #\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> a\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> #\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",

There is a box directly to the right (col 9) at (row 5, col 9), and we have some areas that would allow for movement and interactions.\n\nAs per the strategy:\n1. We should navigate wisely to avoid the piranha (located somewhere else).\n2. Using the box at (5, 9) may allow us to solve puzzles, and since we can push the box, it would be beneficial.\n3. Interacting with the box could also involve bouncing it into other positions or clearing pathways.\n\nSince the last confirmed action is on the current state but we have the option to move right into the box (col 9, row 5), I will take the action to push the box.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will push the box at (5, 9) and is a meaningful step towards progressing in the level while adhering to the strategy. I expect this move to help eliminate boxes and create new pathways.",
