The combination of moving elements, immovable structures, and the need to navigate through a level suggests a focus on both spatial reasoning and timing.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites:** Various types of sprites have different functionalities:\n  - **Immovable Sprites:** These include 'floor', 'hole', 'wall', and 'switch'.\n  - **Interactive Sprites:** The 'box', 'coin', 'avatar', and 'piranha' are interactive. The player controls the 'avatar' that can move around the level.\n  - **Chaser Sprite:** The 'piranha' chases the player, adding an element of danger.\n\n- **Interactions:** \n  - The 'avatar' can kill the 'piranha', collect 'coins', and interact with 'boxes' to create movement.\n  - The 'switch' can spawn walls which can change the level dynamically.\n  - The objective is likely to manipulate boxes and navigate the level while avoiding or outmaneuvering the 'piranha'.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective appears to be for the player (as 'avatar') to eliminate all 'boxes'. Each 'box' must be manipulated into a 'hole' to score points. The 'avatar' must also collect 'coins' for additional scoring.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The player wins by successfully eliminating all the 'boxes' from the level (SpriteCounter for 'box' reaches 0).\n- The player loses if the 'avatar' is killed, which occurs if its SpriteCounter reaches 0 (likely due to the 'piranha').\n\n### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Avoid the Piranhas:** Keep moving and navigate the level strategically to avoid being chased by the 'piranha'. Use walls and boxes as buffers.\n  \n2. **Use Boxes Wisely:** Bounce boxes towards holes. Since boxes can only interact with walls to undo their previous position, find pathways that allow you to manipulate their placement without getting stuck.\n\n3. **Collect Coins:** While focusing on the boxes, don\u2019t neglect to collect coins as they contribute positively to your score.\n\n4. **Utilize Walls:** Activate 'switches' to spawn walls for creating barriers against the 'piranha' or to redirect their path.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves:** Since the level layout is filled with walls, plan the route for the avatar ahead of time to avoid dead ends where the piranha can catch you.\n\n6. **Use Space Rationally:** Make efficient use of the available space to create a clear path for boxes to reach holes while also avoiding paths that could lead you to be trapped against walls by the pursuing piranha.\n\nBy employing these strategies and understanding the interactions of the sprites, players can effectively navigate through levels to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> s\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> w\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> #\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> 0\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> a\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
