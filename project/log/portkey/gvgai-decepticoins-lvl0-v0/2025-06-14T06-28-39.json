    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n#### Genre\nBased on the provided rules, the game seems to fall into the **puzzle-platformer** genre. It involves moving through a level while solving puzzles and avoiding or defeating enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: Different types of sprites (floor, walls, holes, boxes, walls, coins, switches, a moving obstacle) indicate various elements in the game world. The avatar, in this case, represents the player character.\n2. **Interactivity**:\n   - The avatar can interact with coins, switches, other boxes, and the piranha enemy.\n   - Boxes can be manipulated to solve puzzles (like bouncing or falling into holes).\n   - The switch has two effects: it can either create a wall behind the avatar or be destroyed upon interaction.\n   - The piranha chases the avatar, posing a threat that the player must navigate around.\n3. **Movement**: The avatar can move around and interact with other sprites. It can push boxes, collect coins, and use switches.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to remove all boxes from the level before the player's actions lead to failure (i.e., losing all avatars). You achieve this by strategically maneuvering the boxes to suitable locations (such as holes for scoring) while avoiding or defeating the piranha enemy.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reducing the box count to zero, meaning all boxes have been effectively dealt with (either removed or used).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if they run out of avatars, indicating that they can no longer play. This can happen if the avatar encounters the piranha or if boxes are mishandled (e.g., falling into holes instead of proper disposal).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Observe the Level Layout**: Understand the structure of the walls, boxes, and holes. Notice the positions of the piranha and other hazards.\n2. **Prioritize Box Movement**: Direct your movement towards boxes to push them towards the holes for points. Make strategic choices about the order in which you handle each box.\n3. **Avoid the Piranha**: Stay aware of the piranha's position and do not let it corner or chase the avatar into situations where you\u2019ll lose a life.\n4. **Utilize the Switches Wisely**: Switch interactions can either spawn walls (which may create barriers for the piranha or block your path) or remove the switch itself. Plan when to use switches based on immediate needs.\n5. **Accumulate Coins**: While focusing on boxes, collect coins whenever possible as they contribute to your score and may provide small benefits (not directly mentioned in the rules, but typical in games).\n6. **Plan Movements Ahead**: Think multiple moves in advance to avoid getting stuck or leading the piranha towards you unintentionally.\n\nWith these strategies, you can effectively clear the level while managing the threats and puzzles presented.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor -> '.'\nfloor hole -> '0'\nfloor box -> '1'\nfloor wall -> 'w'\nfloor coin -> 'c'\nfloor switch -> 's'\nfloor piranha -> 'e'\nbox floor -> '@'\ncoin floor -> '#'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> w\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> s\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> #\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> w\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> #\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> #\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> a\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> 0\nrow=5, col=11 -> #\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> w\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> w\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> w\nrow=6, col=7 -> w\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> w\nrow=6, col=10 -> w\nrow=6, col=11 -> w\nrow=6, col=12 -> w",
