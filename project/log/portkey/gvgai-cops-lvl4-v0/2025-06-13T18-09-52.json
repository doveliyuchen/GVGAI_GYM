It includes resource management, strategy, and character interaction mechanics.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites and Resources:**\n   - The game features multiple sprites, with specific roles, such as the player-controlled avatar, various thug enemies that flee, a boss enemy, jail doors, and key resources.\n   - Resources include keys and villains of different colors which play a critical role in achieving objectives.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player (avatar) interacts with keys, thugs, jail doors, and jails to achieve objectives.\n   - Collecting resources, defeating enemies, and managing the key count are pivotal for advancement.\n   - Specific interactions involve changing resources, killing sprites, and spawning resources based on conditions.\n\n3. **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n   - The player succeeds by eliminating the boss sprite (named 'boss') and ensuring it does not exist.\n   - The game is lost if time runs out (timeout limit of 1900).\n   - Managing resource counts is crucial, especially the single-use 'key' resource, to advance and unlock new areas.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to defeat the boss enemy while managing limited resources (the key). Players need to collect resources (keys, and villain types) and interact with various game elements (thugs, jail doors, and jails) strategically to progress.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Defeat the boss sprite (limit of 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** Timeout occurs before defeating the boss.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize collecting and managing keys, understanding that you only have one key to use at a time.\n   - Track the number of villains captured as defeating them provides score increases and helps spawn more resources.\n\n2. **Spatial Awareness:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout to navigate efficiently and avoid being trapped by walls or thugs.\n   - Positioning near doors and jails can facilitate quicker access to resources and necessary interactions.\n\n3. **Enemy Handling:**\n   - Focus on defeating thugs to convert them into resources (villains) while keeping an eye on the remaining time.\n   - Engage the boss only when confident in having available resources and time to defeat it without getting overwhelmed.\n\n4. **Time Management:**\n   - Keep a steady pace as you gather resources and defeat enemies to ensure sufficient time remains to face the boss.\n   - Monitor the remaining time regularly to adjust your strategy based on the ticking clock.\n\n5. **Sequential Objective Fulfillment:**\n   - Work towards spawning resources by visiting the depot and jails as soon as you have the necessary keys or resources.\n\nOverall, blend tactical resource management with agile navigation and combat strategies to navigate the challenges of defeating the boss and managing limited resources, ensuring you do not run out of time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

The surrounding context includes walls (b), floors (.), a depot (1) at (1, 4), multiple thugs (e.g., * at (13, 1) and (14, 1)), and a boss (@) located at (11, 5) and (12, 5). There are jail doors (&) at (3, 13) and (11, 4).\n\nSince I am currently facing a situation where I need to prioritize my options effectively for moving towards defeating the boss while managing resources:\n\n1. My immediate priority should be to navigate towards areas with resources (like the depot) and engage with enemies (thugs) sensibly.\n2. The boss is on a different row (11, 5), but I should gather resources before attempting an encounter.\n3. The path to the nearest jail door (3, 13) is blocked by thugs, and the closest access to the depot (1, 4) is further.\n\n**Next Step:** I will take action to explore and potentially defeat a nearby enemy to gather resources, as they can help in moving towards the boss later.\n\nSince I am in the 5th row, and there are options to my immediate left and right, I will move left to (5, 5) where I will be adjacent to a wall and have a view of more thugs nearby.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nI expect this action to potentially place me in a better strategic position to engage with available enemies or collect resources.",
