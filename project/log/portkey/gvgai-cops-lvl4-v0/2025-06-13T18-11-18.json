Collect a resource (key) while navigating through the level.\n2. Defeat various thug enemies to increase score and gain resources.\n3. Reach the jail and interact with it using collected resources to spawn corresponding resources (transports) which can be used strategically.\n4. Eliminate the boss to win the game.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if the boss is defeated (SpriteCounter for boss limit is 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** If a timeout occurs (1900 ticks), the player loses.\n- The avatar must also manage interactions carefully to avoid being blocked or harmed by enemies.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Gather Resources Efficiently:**\n   - Prioritize collecting the key as it unlocks the jaildoor and is critical for progress.\n   - Be cautious while collecting; some thugs kill and thereby increase resource values, which can be critical for gameplay.\n\n2. **Plan Movement Strategically:**\n   - Observe the movement and speed of enemy thugs to avoid encounters. Plan paths that bypass them when possible.\n   - Utilize walls and jaildoors to create barriers between you and aggressive enemies.\n\n3. **Objective Focus:**\n   - Focus on defeating lower-tier thugs (red, green, yellow) to maximize score and resources before attempting to take on the boss.\n   - This will involve navigating towards the jail regularly to spawn transportation resources and managing threats accordingly.\n\n4. **Timing:**\n   - Keep an eye on the timer. Ensure you are not taking too long in one section or getting trapped. \n   - Set checkpoints (in mind) where you should have made certain progress to ensure you\u2019re on track to defeat the boss before the time runs out.\n\n5. **Track Resource Management:**\n   - Monitor your collected resources closely, especially the key, to avoid running into a situation where you cannot unlock necessary doors. \n\n6. **Eliminate the Boss Wisely:**\n   - Once you are ready to confront the boss, make sure you have enough resources and a clear strategy to defeat him, as the score change is substantial.\n\nBy following these strategies and being aware of your surroundings and resources, you\u2019ll enhance your chances of winning while enjoying the game's mechanics and objectives.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, our avatar is located at position (4, 1). The immediate surroundings include some obstacles, with walls (b) surrounding the gameplay area. \n\n### Analyzing the Current State\n- **Nearby Entities:**\n  - To the left (4, 0) is a wall (b).\n  - To the right (4, 2) is a floor tile (.).\n  - Below (5, 1) is a floor tile (.).\n  - Above (3, 1) is a floor tile (.).\n  \nThe key aspect is that there are no enemies directly adjacent to the avatar. Hence, the immediate threat level is low, allowing us to move strategically without fear of being attacked right away.\n\n### Considering Strategy\nSince the objective is to gather resources and ultimately defeat the boss, we could proceed through open spaces:\n\n1. Moving to (4, 2) (to the right) opens further paths.\n2. Moving to (5, 1) (down) also keeps options open.\n3. Moving to (3, 1) (up) also seems to be a viable choice.\n  \nHowever, the current optimal action appears to be moving to (4, 2), opening up potential additional paths for exploration or combat while remaining safe from immediate threats.\n\n### Expected Action\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right expands our exploration options and keeps the game fluid toward resource gathering and enemy encounters.",
