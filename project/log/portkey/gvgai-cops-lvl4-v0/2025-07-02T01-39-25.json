It incorporates elements of **action-adventure** and player-driven resource management, where the player navigates a maze-like environment while interacting with various sprites and enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Player Avatar**: The game centers around a character referred to as the \"avatar,\" which the player controls. The avatar can move within the environment and engage with other sprites.\n- **Enemies**: There are various types of enemies including thugs and a boss, each with specific interactions with the avatar. The thugs flee and the boss poses a direct threat.\n- **Resource Collection**: The game utilizes a resource management system where the avatar collects keys and various villain resources (red, green, yellow) which are critical for progression.\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can collect keys, which allows interaction with jail doors and other elements, leading to the spawning of further resources and score changes.\n- **Objectives**: The objective is to collect as many villain resources as possible while avoiding being killed by enemies or running out of time.\n\n#### Objectives\n- The player must successfully collect different types of villains and defeat enemies, particularly the boss, to win the game.\n- There is a time limit of 1900 units; if the player does not achieve the objectives before this timer expires, they lose.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Defeating the boss (reducing its sprite counter to 0) results in a victory.\n- **Loss Condition**: Failing to reach the win condition before the timer expires leads to a loss.\n\n#### Strategy Suggestions\n1. **Resource Management**: Prioritize gathering the key first, as it is essential for advancing through jail doors and collecting more resources. Managing this resource effectively can lead to a more successful run.\n   \n2. **Enemy Avoidance**: Not all enemies need to be engaged immediately. Understanding when to avoid enemies, especially the thugs that flee, can help maintain momentum in collecting key resources. \n\n3. **Villain Collection**: Focus on collecting yellow and green villains first, as they provide a smaller score boost compared to red villains but are easier to acquire. The red villains yield high scores but may have more considerable risk associated with them.\n\n4. **Final Showdown with Boss**: Approach the boss only when you feel confident in your collected resources and have sufficient health (if health is part of the game). Determine a strategy for this fight since it provides a significant score boost.\n\n5. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer. Since there is a timeout limit, pace your exploration effectively. Rushing can lead to mistakes, but stalling too long can result in defeat.\n\nBy employing these strategies and being mindful of the mechanics at play, players can enhance their chances of achieving victory in this engaging maze strategy game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

The next immediate actions should be focused on exploring the area to collect items and possibly move towards the depot located at (row=1, col=4) to secure valuable resources.\n\nSince the avatar didn't change position last round and is currently aligned to the right of the maze structure, I'll move to the right again to further explore the area and potentially gather resources.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis move should enable me to better assess my surroundings and get closer to any jails or resources that might help with the objectives.
