The layout suggests a maze or dungeon-like structure typical in such games.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Avatar Movement:** Players control an avatar, which can move around the game world and interact with various sprites.\n2. **Collecting Resources:** Players can collect specific resources (keys, villains) from the environment and must manage their inventory carefully.\n3. **Interactivity with Objects:** Players can interact with walls, jail doors, and other obstacles which influence movement or resource collection.\n4. **Enemy Interactions:** There are various enemy types (thugs and a boss) that the player must avoid or defeat to progress, while managing to collect resources.\n5. **Scoring System:** Certain actions (like defeating thugs or collecting specific villains) contribute to a score, with more challenging enemies yielding higher points.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- Collect keys to open jail doors.\n- Defeat enemies (thugs) to collect villain resources and score points.\n- Ensure the defeat of the boss within the time limit.\n- Avoid getting killed by enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they defeat the boss (spriteCounter limit for boss reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if they run out of time (timeout limit set to 1900) or are killed by an enemy sprite.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Management**: \n   - Keep a close eye on your key inventory. Only collect keys when necessary to avoid running into situations where you exhaust them. \n   - Prioritize defeating thugs to gather villain resources that will boost your score.\n\n2. **Strategic Movement**:\n   - Navigate the maze thoughtfully; avoid getting cornered by thugs. Use walls to your advantage to prevent being attacked and to create a chokepoint.\n   - The player should learn the movement patterns of thugs to avoid them or plan attacks without getting trapped.\n\n3. **Prioritize Targets**:\n   - Target the thugs in the order of their resource value; focus on the yellow thugs first (5 points), then the green (2 points), and lastly the red (1 point) in a specific situation for maximizing score.\n   - Regularly check the jail for opportunities to spawn and collect more resources after defeating enough thugs.\n\n4. **Plan for the Boss**:\n   - Keep track of the game time. Before engaging with the boss, ensure you have ample resources and possibly a good score from previously collected villains.\n   - Prepare for a potentially high stake battle; ensure full health or advantageous positioning before the encounter.\n\n5. **Use the Environment**:\n   - Regularly use walls and jail doors as defense mechanisms to create space between yourself and the thugs.\n   - If surrounded, retreat to areas where you can regroup and strategize.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can effectively manage resources, avoid unnecessary encounters, maximize score, and ultimately defeat the boss to achieve victory in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

    "content": "In the current state, the avatar 'a' is located at (row=6, col=7). The surrounding environment consists of walls ('b'), a jail ('%'), and a variety of sprites, including thugs ('*'), a boss ('@'), and jails that are unlocked by jail doors ('&'). \n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar must avoid the thugs and can interact with the jail doors to potentially access more resources.\n2. The boss appears on (row=11, col=5) and (row=12, col=5), which means it requires careful navigation to reach.\n3. The nearest thug is located at (row=13, col=1) and (row=14, col=1) directly beneath where the player is located.\n\n### Current Strategy:\nGiven the overall strategy, it\u2019s important to avoid immediate danger from the nearby thugs while also working towards defeating the boss and collecting resources.\n\n### Next Action:\nThe avatar should first avoid moving directly down (where the thugs are), so the best course of action would be to move up towards the jail where it might be able to collect additional resources or get to safety.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nBy moving up, I expect to avoid the immediate threat of thugs and possibly open up new paths or opportunities in the game.",
