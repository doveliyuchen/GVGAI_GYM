    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n**Game Analysis**\n\n**Genre:**  \nThis game appears to be a mix between an action-adventure and puzzle genre. Players navigate a maze-like environment, interact with various sprites, and need to manage resources while overcoming challenges.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**  \n1. **Player Sprite (Avatar):** The 'avatar' represents the player character, which is capable of movement and interaction.\n2. **Collecting Resources:** Players can collect keys and eliminate enemies (thugs and villains) to gain resources, which are important for progressing through the game.\n3. **Interactions:** There are specific interactions defined between the avatar and various sprites:\n   - Collecting the 'key' allows the player to interact with the 'jaildoor' and potentially defeat enemies.\n   - Thugs, colored red, green, and yellow, represent different enemies that must be defeated, which will affect the player's resources.\n   - Specific enemies spawn resources (transforms) that players can collect to increase their score.\n4. **Immovable and Fleeing Enemies:** Certain sprites (like walls and floors) are immovable, while thugs can flee, adding a dynamic component to the gameplay as players must chase or trap them.\n5. **Boss Fight:** A boss sprite is present, which represents a significant challenge that must be defeated to win the game.\n6. **Timed Condition:** There is a timer for the game. Players must complete their objectives before the time runs out.\n7. **Score System:** Players gain scores based on defeating enemies and interacting with resources.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective is to defeat the boss while managing to collect keys and resources to minimize the values of enemies (villains) efficiently. Players also have to ensure the 'jail' does not become excessive, which can allow for quick collection of more enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by defeating the boss sprite, ensuring there are no remaining bosses in play (`SpriteCounter stype=boss limit=0`).\n- **Loss Condition:** If time runs out without defeating the boss, the player loses (`Timeout limit=1900 win=False`).\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\n1. **Efficient Movement:** Utilize movement patterns to collect keys and defeat thugs while avoiding being trapped against walls.\n2. **Resource Management:** Focus on collecting and utilizing keys and managing the spawning of villains by interacting with the jail strategically. Collect smaller villains to stop them from spawning before dealing with the larger threats, which will help in minimizing their appearances.\n3. **Prioritize Threats:** Focus on defeating the colored thugs first since they contribute directly to resource counts. Knowing the points value helps prioritize targets based on score needs.\n4. **Utilize the Jail:** Always keep track of how many resources you have at the jail, as this will influence your ability to spawn trans sprites for score gain. Completing jails will allow interaction for score points while allowing strategic resource generation.\n5. **Time Management:** Monitor the timer constantly. Plan moves with foresight to avoid running out of time\u2014balance between attacking thugs and collecting resources efficiently.\n6. **Boss Engagement:** Save up for a final encounter when all villains are managed or minimized. Ensure you have adequate health/resources to tackle the boss effectively.\n\nBy following this strategy, players can maximize their chances of winning while effectively managing their resources and time.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->

The character currently needs to eliminate enemies if they're to progress through the game successfully.\n2. The immediate goal should be to collect keys and defeat enemies, particularly before encountering the boss situated at (11, 5) and (12, 5).\n\nTaking into account the strategic suggestions and the position of my avatar, I should move LEFT to position myself closer to the jaildoor (next to the red thug at (11, 1)). This would allow me to prepare for any confrontation by being able to utilize any available resources from the jail.\n\nThus, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action allows my avatar to move left toward a more strategic position to deal with resources and potential threats. I expect this aligns with the strategy by allowing me to engage with enemies effectively while keeping track of their position concerning the jail.",
