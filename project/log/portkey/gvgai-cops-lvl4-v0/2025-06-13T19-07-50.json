It involves navigating a maze-like environment, interacting with various sprites, and achieving objectives under specific conditions.\n\n2. **Mechanics**:\n   - The player controls an avatar (likely a character represented with graphics) that can move and interact with different sprites within the game world.\n   - Movement is constrained by walls, and the avatar must navigate around them while avoiding enemy sprites (thugs and a boss).\n   - There are specific resources (keys and villains) that can be collected and used strategically to influence gameplay.\n   - The avatar can collect the key sprite, which allows interaction with the jaildoor, while encountering different color thugs releases corresponding villains.\n   - Interaction with the jail leads to the spawning of transformation sprites (trans) that can also yield score points when dealt with properly.\n\n3. **Objectives**:\n   - The primary goal of the game is to defeat the boss sprite. The game is won when the boss is eliminated.\n   - Players must collect villains and manage resources (particularly the key) to successfully interact with other sprites and maximize their score.\n   - Avoiding the boss while also managing time to complete interactions is crucial because there is a timeout condition.\n\n4. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - A player wins by ensuring that no boss sprites are present (i.e., SpriteCounter for boss reached zero).\n   - A player loses if they run out of time (1900 units) before accomplishing their objectives.\n\n5. **Possible Overall Strategy**:\n   - **Resource Management**: Gather keys quickly, as they are crucial for progressing through the jaildoor. Keep track of how many keys you have in relation to the jaildoor requirement.\n   - **Effective Navigation**: Learn the layout of the level to efficiently find and defeat thugs while avoiding walls and unnecessary encounters that slow down progress (like stepping back).\n   - **Prioritize Goals**: Focus on defeating thugs to spawn villains strategically and prioritize tackling the boss as soon as possible\u2014perhaps deliberating collecting lower-value villains before the higher-value ones to build score and resources.\n   - **Time Awareness**: Keep a constant eye on the timer. If the game is nearing a timeout, prioritize actions that guarantee interaction with the boss or collecting resources that will either lead to victory or at least improve score for potential rankings.\n\nBy following this analysis and strategy, players should be able to navigate the game challenges effectively while working toward the ultimate goal of defeating the boss and managing resources judiciously.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor ->
