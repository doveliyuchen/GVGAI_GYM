    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the provided game rules, here\u2019s an analysis of the game's genre, mechanics, objectives, and strategies:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game operates within the realm of **puzzle/platforming**. Players must navigate through levels, interact with objects and enemies, and solve spatial challenges to progress while managing resources like health points.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including immovable objects (walls, goal, holes), moving avatars (player character), and passive objects (crates, boulders).\n  \n2. **Player Actions**: The player's avatar can interact with walls, crates, boulders, enemies, and goal objects. \n   - The avatar can \"bounce back\" or \"step back\" when colliding with specific objects.\n   - The avatar can lose health points when encountering enemies and potentially gain points by achieving objectives.\n\n3. **Goals and Scoring**: The primary goal is to reach the \"goal\" sprite, which, when reached, increases the score. There are also mechanisms allowing players to score points through specific interactions, such as destroying crates or boulders in certain locations.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to navigate to the \u201cgoal\u201d sprite while managing the avatar's health, interacting with elements in the environment, and solving spatial puzzles. Players must avoid enemies and utilize objects strategically to reach the objective.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when there are no \u201cgoal\u201d sprites remaining.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the player\u2019s avatar reaches zero health points.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Avoid Enemies**: Prioritize staying away from the enemy sprites. Collisions with enemies directly decrease health, so use walls and other sprites to block paths.\n\n2. **Use Crates and Boulders Strategically**: Use crates and boulders to manipulate the environment. For example, pushing boulders into holes can clear paths or eliminate enemies/prizes. \n\n3. **Maintain Health**: Manage your engagement with enemies carefully. Since the game includes health points for the avatar, any encounters should be avoided or mitigated. Use crates as shields whenever possible.\n\n4. **Score Maximization**: Take advantage of score-earning interactions by strategically positioning crates and boulders to maximize opportunities for point collection.\n\n5. **Plan Movements**: Map out your movements since the sprite layout indicates potential pathways and obstacles. The arrangement suggests areas you might get trapped or forced to retreat from enemies, so plan sequential moves carefully.\n\n6. **Utilize Wall Interactions**: Use the walls effectively to bounce back from enemies or prevent their movement. Creating \u201csafe zones\u201d by trapping enemies may allow more strategic gameplay without risking health.\n\nIn summary, players must navigate levels thoughtfully, balancing the need to move towards objectives while avoiding threats and maximizing scoring opportunities.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> a\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> $\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",

From this position, I will analyze the possible movements and choose an action accordingly.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar is surrounded by walls (represented by 'b'), except for the left (col=3) and right (col=5), where there are walls before encountering crates (row=6, col=5).\n- Up (row=5) is clear to move into, but there are crates in both row 5, col 6 to the left and right.\n- Moving down (row=7) is also an option, but that row has crates and enemies towards the right.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Enemies**: Since row 7 has an enemy located at row=7, col=13, moving in that direction isn't safe.\n2. **Maximize Movements**: The row above (row=5) has more movement options available. By moving up, I can create better strategic opportunities on the next move.\n\n### Decision:\nI will choose to move **up** to row 5, col 4.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should position the avatar to explore new areas with greater strategic options, as the row above presents a different layout for further movement.",
