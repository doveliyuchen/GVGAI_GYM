The avatar can move and interact with other sprites, while most other elements are immovable or passive.\n- **Interactions:** The interactions define how the avatar and other sprites behave. The avatar can push crates and boulders, interact with holes for scoring, and compete against enemies. Key interactions include bouncing off objects, killing sprites (e.g., through interactions with holes or crate collisions), and score changes affecting win conditions.\n- **Movement and Health:** The avatar has a fixed health point system (30) and must avoid enemies that reduce health when contacted. The player needs to navigate strategically to protect the avatar while manipulating the environment.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary goal is to guide the avatar to the 'goal' sprite to score points and ultimately reach the sprite counter limit for winning the game. To succeed, the player needs to reach the goal while avoiding health loss from enemy interactions.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the counter for the 'goal' sprite hits zero, and the player successfully navigates the maze to lessen or eliminate the enemy threats.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the health points of the avatar reach zero due to interactions with enemies.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Prioritize Health Management:**\n   - Avoid contact with enemies to preserve health points. Use the environment (walls and crates) to navigate around enemies safely.\n\n2. **Utilize Objects Strategically:**\n   - Use crates and boulders to navigate obstacles and clear paths. Push crates to eliminate enemies and open routes by killing other obstacles or pushing them into holes.\n\n3. **Plan Movement Carefully:**\n   - Move strategically to ensure that the avatar doesn\u2019t get trapped or surrounded by enemies. Take note of the 'come-back' interactions with crates to maintain movement options.\n\n4. **Maximize Scoring Opportunities:**\n   - Aim for the square and round holes with your boulders and crates to earn points. Successfully manipulating these items can provide strategic advantages throughout the level.\n\n5. **Explore the Layout:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the level layout to formulate a pathway to the goal effectively. Understanding the position of enemies and potential hazards will inform movement strategies.\n\n6. **Engage with the Environment:**\n   - Use the immovable walls to bounce off and reposition yourself, along with leveraging the abilities of the crates and boulders to create pathways or block enemy movement.\n\nBy prioritizing health, using environmental mechanics wisely, and planning movements strategically, players can increase their chances of successfully navigating the level and achieving victory in the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> a\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> #\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> $\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, I note that the avatar ('a') is at position (2, 2) and there are several obstacles around including crates '#' and enemies '$'. The goal '%' is located at (4, 0), with square holes '*' nearby at (2, 8) through (2, 12).\n\nGiven the objective to avoid contact with enemies and prioritize health management, I will look for a movement that allows the avatar to safely navigate without coming into contact with any enemies.\n\nThe available actions are:\n\n1. Action Left (to (2, 1)): There are walls ('b') which block movement.\n2. Action Right (to (2, 3)): This space is currently empty ('.').\n3. Action Down (to (3, 2)): This space is empty ('.').\n4. Action Up (to (1, 2)): This space contains a crate ('#') which may obstruct movement in future turns.\n\nSince moving right to (2, 3) or moving down to (3, 2) are valid moves, I will choose to move Down to position (3, 2) where there are no enemies or obstacles that might pose a risk to my health.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down to an empty space, aligning with the strategy to avoid enemies and manage health effectively. I expect this move will help me reposition closer to the goal while maintaining safety from enemies.",
