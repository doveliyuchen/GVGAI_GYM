Players must navigate a grid-like environment, solve puzzles involving crates and boulders, and avoid enemies while trying to reach a goal.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites including the player avatar, crates, boulders, holes, walls, enemies, and a goal. Each sprite has distinct properties and interactions.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player (avatar) can interact with crates, boulders, walls, and enemies. \n   - Crates can be pushed, and they can bounce off each other. \n   - Boulders can cause damage to both themselves and the avatar, depending on interactions with holes.\n3. **Movement**: The player can move around the grid and must avoid walls and enemies while using the crates and boulders strategically.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal while maximizing the score through specific interactions (like defeating enemies or getting rid of crates in holes).\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins when there are no more goal sprites remaining on the screen (SpriteCounter stype=goal limit=0).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points drop to 0 (SpriteCounter stype=avatar limit=0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Understand Your Surroundings**: Before making any moves, take time to observe the layout of walls, crates, boulders, holes, enemies, and the goal. This will help map out potential strategies.\n\n2. **Use Crates Wisely**: Since crates can bounce off walls, each other, and can be manipulated against holes to score points, use them strategically to clear enemies and barriers while approaching the goal.\n\n3. **Boulder Navigation**: Boulders can be dangerous as they can damage both players and enemies. Use them to your advantage, especially when they can push enemies back or clear a path.\n\n4. **Managing Health**: Be cautious around enemies and ensure you have a plan for evasion or elimination. Do not engage unless necessary; always look for safer paths.\n\n5. **Score Optimization**: Aim to interact with holes using boulders and crates to achieve high scores. This can be a significant advantage in unlocking or reaching the goal.\n\n6. **Plan Escape Routes**: Always anticipate enemy movement and prepare an escape route back to safety. Ensuring your avatar does not get trapped or cornered will preserve health points.\n\n7. **Leveraging the Environment**: Utilize walls and immovable objects to block enemies while you strategize your next move. \n\nBy combining foresight and strategic use of available mechanics, players can clear levels effectively and with higher scores, ultimately reaching the game goals while maintaining health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> #\nrow=2, col=9 -> #\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> a\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> #\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> #\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> #\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> $\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> $\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",
