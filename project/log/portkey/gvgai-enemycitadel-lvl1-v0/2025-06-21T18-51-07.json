    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThis game seems to fall into the **puzzle** and **action** genre, with elements of strategy as players must navigate a maze-like environment while managing interactions with various sprites.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites** include the avatar, walls, enemies, and various passive objects (like crates and boulders) which interact with the avatar and other sprites in unique ways.\n- The **avatar** is controlled by the player and has health points (30).\n- The objective is to interact with various elements in the environment, solve spatial puzzles using crates and boulders, and avoid or defeat enemies.\n- **Interactivity** includes mechanics such as bouncing off crates or boulders, stepping back upon hitting walls or enemies, and the ability to 'kill' certain sprites by interacting with them.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary goal is to reach the goal sprite ('goal') while scoring points by eliminating other sprites (like crates and holes).\n- The player needs to maintain their health points and avoid being defeated by enemies.\n  \n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- The game is won if the player (avatar) reaches the goal sprite and there are no goal sprites left.\n- The game is lost if the avatar's health points reach zero.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Plan Your Moves:**\n   - Since enemies can push you back, be cautious about how you maneuver around them. Maintain distance where possible.\n\n2. **Utilize Crates and Boulders:**\n   - Use crates and boulders to clear paths or block enemies. Crates can bounce against each other and clear space for you to navigate.\n   - Position crates near boulders strategically, as they interact in ways that can either eliminate or block sprites effectively.\n\n3. **Avoid Enemies:**\n   - Be mindful of enemy positions and movement. If you encounter one, try to evade instead of engaging, as they can reduce your health points.\n  \n4. **Focus on the Goal:**\n   - Always prioritize reaching the goal sprite, but be on the lookout for points you can gain by eliminating crates and holes before heading to the goal.\n\n5. **Manage Health Wisely:**\n   - Keep an eye on your health points and limit interactions that could lead to health loss. Retreat when necessary to avoid engaging enemies directly.\n\n6. **Use the Environment:**\n   - Walls are immovable and can aid or hinder movement. Use them to your advantage by creating traps for enemies or forming barriers for protection.\n\nBy employing strategies that leverage the environment and focus on careful interaction with sprites, players can improve their chances of winning while minimizing health loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> $\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",
