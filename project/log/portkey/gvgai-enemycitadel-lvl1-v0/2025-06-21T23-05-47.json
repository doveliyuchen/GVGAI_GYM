Players need to solve spatial puzzles while navigating through obstacles and enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game consists of various sprites, including walls, enemies, crates, boulders, and holes (square and round).\n- **Movement:** The player controls an avatar that can move around the game area. The avatar interacts with other sprites, which can lead to various outcomes (e.g., the avatar can bounce off crates or lose health points when hitting enemies).\n- **Passable Terrain:** Players can navigate through the map where walls and immovable objects define the boundaries.\n- **Objectives:**\n  - The main goals are to reach the \"goal\" sprite (an immovable object) and collect points.\n  - Players score points by interacting and removing crates, as well as defeating enemies indirectly via boulders.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The player's primary objective is to reach the \"goal\" sprite while overcoming obstacles.\n- Players can achieve this by strategically using crates and boulders to clear paths or eliminate enemies.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins if they can reach the goal (which results in scoring points) while maintaining at least one remaining avatar.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar's health reaches zero or if the avatar is unable to reach the goal due to being blocked or eliminated.\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Plan Moves Carefully:** Given that some interactions lead to bounce effects, it's crucial to think about each move and how it may affect surrounding sprites.\n2. **Utilize Boulders and Crates:** Use boulders to remove crates or enemy obstacles by leading them towards square and round holes, which can lead to point acquisitions. Crates can also be pushed or stacked to clear pathways.\n3. **Avoid Enemies:** Directly confronting enemies leads to health loss. Instead, look for ways to maneuver around them or use crates and boulders defensively.\n4. **Exploit Goal Proximity:** Keep track of how close you are to the goal and prioritize making a path towards it as soon as it's feasible.\n5. **Manage Health Points:** Since the avatar has limited health, be cautious when navigating areas with enemies. Look for safe routes or consider using boulders first as a distraction or attack against enemies.\n\nBy integrating these strategies with a careful approach to movement and interaction, players can effectively navigate through levels, achieve their goals, and maintain their avatar\u2019s health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> $\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> #\nrow=3, col=5 -> #\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> a\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> #\nrow=5, col=6 -> #\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> #\nrow=6, col=3 -> #\nrow=6, col=4 -> #\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",
