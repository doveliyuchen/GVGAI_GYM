Players navigate a grid-like environment filled with various sprites, including walls, enemies, and interactive objects.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game features multiple types of sprites, including immovable objects (walls, holes), passive objects (crates, boulders), and the avatar (player character) with health points.\n- **Interactions**: Players can interact with various sprites, leading to movement (bouncing or stepping back) and consequences (like losing health or gaining points).\n- **Health System**: The avatar has health points (30), and interactions with enemies reduce these points.\n- **Scoring**: Players gain points by achieving specific interactions, primarily through defeating other sprites or reaching the goal.\n  \n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to navigate the avatar through the level, interact with crates and boulders to achieve certain goals (such as clearing holes), avoid or defeat enemies, and ultimately reach the goal sprite while keeping the avatar's health intact.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the goal is reached, as indicated by the requirement that the 'goal' sprite limit reaches 0.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost when the avatar sprite limit reaches 0, meaning the player's health has been fully depleted.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Movement Management**: Carefully plan your movements to avoid enemies which can damage the avatar. Use the environment (walls, crates) to shield or block enemy paths.\n  \n2. **Boulder Strategy**: Use boulders to clear square holes and round holes, as both actions can result in scoring and make the path to the goal clearer. Bounce the boulders effectively to avoid getting trapped.\n\n3. **Crate Utilization**: Leverage crates to navigate the space; they can be used to bounce off or block enemies. Specific interactions with crates can also help clear the path toward the goal.\n\n4. **Health Preservation**: Maintain awareness of your health points. Avoid unnecessary conflicts with enemies, and use crates to block or evade attacks.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves**: Since there are limited moves allowed directly after certain interactions (like stepping back), consider the sequence of actions carefully. A well-timed action can change the layout and help position the player more favorably.\n\n6. **Scoring Priorities**: Focus on scoring interactions first to gain a better advantage. The scoring not only affects win conditions but may also provide a buffer against lost health points.\n\n7. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Before making a move, preview potential consequences, especially with walls or enemy interactions that can lead to stepping back or losing health.\n\nBy following the above strategies, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the levels while maximizing score and preserving health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> .\nrow=1, col=13 -> $\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> a\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> $\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> .\nrow=8, col=12 -> .\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",
