Players navigate through a grid-like environment, solving puzzles to progress and achieve specific goals.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: The game consists of various types of sprites (objects) that players interact with, including a moving avatar, immovable walls, goals, holes, crates, boulders, and enemies.\n- **Movement**: The avatar can move around the play area, but interaction with certain objects\u2014like walls and holes\u2014causes it to bounce back or be constrained.\n- **Interactions**: The core interactions involve pushing crates, colliding with boulders, triggering enemy reactions, and utilizing holes for strategic plays.\n- **Boulders and Crates**: These key items can be moved around the play area. Boulders can interact with other objects to potentially eliminate enemies or change the game's state.\n\n#### Objective\nThe main objective is to collect the goal (represented by the 'goal' sprite) while avoiding losing health points by interacting with enemies. The player needs to manage interactions effectively to navigate the environment and resituate objects wisely, using them to secure a path to victory.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game when the sprite counter for the 'goal' reaches zero, meaning all goals have been fulfilled.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar's health points reach zero, indicating that the player has been overwhelmed by enemy encounters or adverse interactions.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Before acting, evaluate the layout of the level and determine the optimal path to the goal, considering the positions of the crates, boulders, and enemies.\n  \n2. **Utilize Crates and Boulders**: Strategically maneuver boulders to knock out enemies or create pathways. Push crates to clear goals or activate the score change interactions as needed.\n\n3. **Avoid Enemies**: Stay aware of enemy locations; try to use crates or boulders as barriers to keep them away from the avatar. Engaging directly with enemies can reduce health points significantly.\n\n4. **Explore Holes**: Determine how the round and square holes are advantageous for eliminating sprites or bypassing obstacles.\n\n5. **Monitor Health**: Keep track of the avatar\u2019s health points. If health is running low, prioritize avoiding enemies and focus on clearing the level efficiently.\n\n6. **Iterate and React**: If an encounter leads to bounce-back or other negative interactions, use the opportunity to rethink your strategy and try a different approach.\n\nBy employing these strategies, players should be able to navigate the level, eliminate necessary targets, and ultimately reach their goals while maintaining health.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nroundhole background -> '0'\nsquarehole background -> '1'\nboulder background -> 'b'\ncrate background -> 'c'\ngoal background -> 'g'\nenemy background -> 'e'\nbackground -> '.'\nboulder -> '@'\ncrate -> '#'\nenemy -> '$'\ngoal -> '%'\nroundhole -> '&'\nsquarehole -> '*'\nwall -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> b\nrow=0, col=1 -> b\nrow=0, col=2 -> b\nrow=0, col=3 -> b\nrow=0, col=4 -> b\nrow=0, col=5 -> b\nrow=0, col=6 -> b\nrow=0, col=7 -> b\nrow=0, col=8 -> b\nrow=0, col=9 -> b\nrow=0, col=10 -> b\nrow=0, col=11 -> b\nrow=0, col=12 -> b\nrow=0, col=13 -> b\nrow=0, col=14 -> b\nrow=0, col=15 -> b\nrow=1, col=0 -> b\nrow=1, col=1 -> b\nrow=1, col=2 -> #\nrow=1, col=3 -> #\nrow=1, col=4 -> #\nrow=1, col=5 -> #\nrow=1, col=6 -> #\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> b\nrow=1, col=11 -> b\nrow=1, col=12 -> $\nrow=1, col=13 -> .\nrow=1, col=14 -> .\nrow=1, col=15 -> b\nrow=2, col=0 -> b\nrow=2, col=1 -> b\nrow=2, col=2 -> #\nrow=2, col=3 -> #\nrow=2, col=4 -> #\nrow=2, col=5 -> #\nrow=2, col=6 -> #\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> *\nrow=2, col=9 -> *\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> *\nrow=2, col=12 -> *\nrow=2, col=13 -> @\nrow=2, col=14 -> .\nrow=2, col=15 -> b\nrow=3, col=0 -> b\nrow=3, col=1 -> b\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> #\nrow=3, col=7 -> #\nrow=3, col=8 -> #\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> b\nrow=3, col=11 -> b\nrow=3, col=12 -> b\nrow=3, col=13 -> b\nrow=3, col=14 -> b\nrow=3, col=15 -> b\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> &\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> a\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> #\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> .\nrow=4, col=13 -> .\nrow=4, col=14 -> .\nrow=4, col=15 -> b\nrow=5, col=0 -> b\nrow=5, col=1 -> b\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> #\nrow=5, col=8 -> #\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> .\nrow=5, col=13 -> .\nrow=5, col=14 -> .\nrow=5, col=15 -> b\nrow=6, col=0 -> b\nrow=6, col=1 -> b\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> #\nrow=6, col=6 -> #\nrow=6, col=7 -> #\nrow=6, col=8 -> #\nrow=6, col=9 -> b\nrow=6, col=10 -> #\nrow=6, col=11 -> #\nrow=6, col=12 -> *\nrow=6, col=13 -> #\nrow=6, col=14 -> #\nrow=6, col=15 -> b\nrow=7, col=0 -> b\nrow=7, col=1 -> b\nrow=7, col=2 -> #\nrow=7, col=3 -> #\nrow=7, col=4 -> #\nrow=7, col=5 -> #\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> b\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> @\nrow=7, col=13 -> .\nrow=7, col=14 -> .\nrow=7, col=15 -> b\nrow=8, col=0 -> b\nrow=8, col=1 -> b\nrow=8, col=2 -> b\nrow=8, col=3 -> b\nrow=8, col=4 -> b\nrow=8, col=5 -> b\nrow=8, col=6 -> b\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> b\nrow=8, col=10 -> .\nrow=8, col=11 -> $\nrow=8, col=12 -> $\nrow=8, col=13 -> .\nrow=8, col=14 -> .\nrow=8, col=15 -> b\nrow=9, col=0 -> b\nrow=9, col=1 -> b\nrow=9, col=2 -> b\nrow=9, col=3 -> b\nrow=9, col=4 -> b\nrow=9, col=5 -> b\nrow=9, col=6 -> b\nrow=9, col=7 -> b\nrow=9, col=8 -> b\nrow=9, col=9 -> b\nrow=9, col=10 -> b\nrow=9, col=11 -> b\nrow=9, col=12 -> b\nrow=9, col=13 -> b\nrow=9, col=14 -> b\nrow=9, col=15 -> b",
