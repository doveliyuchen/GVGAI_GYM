The use of a maze-like environment and interaction-based mechanics suggests strategic decision-making is key.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game contains various sprites representing different objects and entities such as the player avatar, goals, keys, walls, enemies, and items that the avatar can interact with. \n- **Avatar Interaction:** The avatar can attack enemies with a sword, collect keys, and interact with door goals.\n- **NPCs:** There are different types of enemy sprites that have varying speeds and behaviors (quick, normal, and slow), which implies a need for tactical engagement.\n- **Goals:** There are two types of goals (small and large) that score differently when interacted with. The small goal requires a key, while the large goal can be completed with or without a key, but contributes the same score.\n- **Score System:** There is a dynamic score system that rewards or penalizes players based on their actions\u2014killing enemies or completing goals either increases the score or decreases it depending on interactions.\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The primary objective is to collect keys and progress toward the goals located on the map while managing encounters with enemies.\n- Players must aim to kill enemies and collect small goals (which require keys) to increase their score.\n- The termination condition indicates victory is achieved when all small and large goals are completed, while losing occurs if the avatar is defeated.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Winning Conditions:** \n  - Successfully interact with a specified number of small goals (with the key) or large goals.\n- **Losing Conditions:** \n  - If the avatar is killed (indicated by a SpriteCounter for the avatar).\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n1. **Explore Efficiently:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the map layout to locate keys and goals quickly. Identify where enemies are, as some paths may be safer than others.\n\n2. **Combat Strategy:**\n   - Engage with enemies wisely. Use the sword effectively to eliminate them while avoiding unnecessary damage. Choose your battles; sometimes it may be better to avoid conflict.\n\n3. **Key Management:**\n   - Aim to collect keys early to unlock small goals, as they can yield additional score points. Keep an eye on the status of your keys and prioritize unlocking the small goals.\n\n4. **Progress towards Goals:**\n   - Focus on reaching the large goal as it's worth a significant score boost. Take note that both the small and large goals give the same score when defeated with the key, but the small goals offer a strategic advantage when combined with key collection.\n\n5. **Monitor Health:**\n   - Keep track of the avatar's health during combat. Avoid unnecessary risks, as losing the avatar results in a loss of the game. \n\n6. **Utilize Environment:**\n   - Make use of walls and obstacles to redirect enemy paths if necessary. This can help create opportunities for attacks without immediate retaliation.\n\n7. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Each level should be approached with a clear route in mind. After engaging with one part of the map, plan which areas to tackle next based on the state of your health and available keys.\n\nBy combining these strategies with careful planning and observation of enemy behavior, players can maximize their chances of achieving victory while minimizing loss.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nvase -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nsword wall -> 'n'\nmonsterNormal vase -> 's'\nwithkey -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> s\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> s\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> #\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the objective is to progress through the environment, collect keys, and reach the various goals. \n\n### Current Observations:\n1. The avatar's position is not specified in the current state. By analyzing the map, the avatar likely starts in row 10, col 10 where the 'b' (with key) is located.\n2. The map has walls ('w') surrounding an open area where multiple goals, including a small goal ('&') and large goal ('#'), exist.\n3. There are monsters present, particularly in row 8; however, the immediate vicinity of the avatar in row 10 does not include enemies.\n  \n### Strategic Options:\n- Since the avatar has a key (as indicated by the 'b') at the current location, it would be strategic to move towards the small goal ('&') at row 10, col 11 or towards the large goal ('#') at row 12, col 6.\n- To begin, moving right (to col 11) seems optimal since it's a direct path to collect another goal and maintains the position closer to accessible goals.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the observations and the need to move towards achieving goals effectively:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n  \nThis action is directed right to interact with the small goal. Following this action will facilitate progression in the game as it aligns with the strategy of maximizing score through goal completion.",
