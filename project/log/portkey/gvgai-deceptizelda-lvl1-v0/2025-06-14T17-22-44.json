It incorporates exploration and combat while requiring strategic thinking to navigate the environment and interact with various objects.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites**: The game's characters and objects are represented as sprites, which include the player avatar, enemies, keys, goals, and walls.\n2. **Player Interaction**: The player can interact with different sprites leading to various outcomes (e.g., killing enemies, collecting keys, and opening goals).\n3. **Combat**: The player avatar has a sword and can engage with enemies and objects. Defeating enemies and destroying vases yields score changes.\n4. **Objectives**: The player must collect keys and score points by interacting with goals while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n\n**Objectives:**\n1. Collect keys to access both the small and large goals.\n2. Accumulate points by defeating enemies and destroying vases.\n3. Achieve victory conditions by ensuring all small and large goals have been met.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions**:\n  - The game is won when all instances of the small goal and large goal are interacted with successfully (both sprite counters for these goals reach zero).\n- **Loss Conditions**:\n  - The game is lost if the player avatar sprite is defeated (if its counter reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Focus on managing your encounters with enemies to minimize losses. Aim to engage strategically, using your sword effectively while also being aware of your health/status. \n\n2. **Key Collection**: \n   - Prioritize finding keys to access both small and large goals. Identifying the key locations will allow you to plan your path more efficiently.\n\n3. **Goal Prioritization**:\n   - Start with smaller goals first as they provide easier rewards and could lead to unlocking larger goals. \n\n4. **Avoiding Combat**:\n   - If an encounter seems too risky, try to avoid it unless you need to eliminate an enemy blocking your path. \n\n5. **Use of Vases**:\n   - Do not underestimate the importance of destroying vases. They yield small points and could assist in reaching goals faster.\n\n6. **Exploration**: \n   - Explore fully to understand the layout, looking out for enemy spawn points and key locations, which can give you a tactical advantage.\n\nBy following these strategic steps while staying aware of the avatar's health and surroundings, players can navigate the game effectively and work towards achieving the win conditions.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nvase -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nmonsterNormal vase -> 'm'\nsword -> 'n'\nnokey sword -> 's'\nwithkey -> 'b'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> *\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> $\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> $\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> n\nrow=10, col=10 -> b\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> #\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, let's identify the key elements:\n\n- **Avatar position**: The avatar is currently located at (10, 9) which has a sprite representing a sword ('n'). Right adjacent to this position at (10, 10) is a sprite indicating the presence of a key ('b') and a small goal ('&') just to the right at (10, 11).\n\n### Current Objectives:\n1. **Collect keys** (`'+'` or `'b'` here).\n2. **Interact with goals** (`'&'`).\n3. **Avoid monsters** (`'$'`, or other monster sprites).\n\n### Strategy Application:\nFollowing the winning strategy:\n- Collect the available key which will allow access to further goals.\n- Next, aim for the small goal to maximize points.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n1. **Collect the Key**: Move right (to (10, 10)) to collect the key.\n   - This is important as it could provide a tactical advantage to unlock larger goals later.\n  \n2. **Interact with the Small Goal**: After collecting the key, interact with the small goal directly adjacent to the key.\n\n### Action Execution:\nThe immediate action is to move to the right to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should result in collecting the key and positioning the avatar directly next to the small goal, aligning with both strategy and objective.",
