    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the game rules and level layout provided, the game can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Game Genre\nThis game seems to fall into the **action-adventure** or **puzzle** genre, featuring exploration elements combined with combat mechanics and resource management (keys and goals).\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: \n  - The game includes various sprites such as the player avatar, enemies, walls, keys, goals, and obstacles. \n  - The `avatar` sprite can shoot a `sword` to interact with other sprites.\n  - Different types of `monsters` (quick, normal, slow) act as enemies that can inflict damage to the avatar.\n  \n- **Interactions**: \n  - **Goal completion**: There are two types of goals - `smallgoal` and `largegoal`. The player can achieve these by using keys and defeating enemies.\n  - **Key mechanics**: The avatar needs to collect keys (`key` sprite) to transform into the `withkey` state, allowing access to certain goals.\n  - **Combat**: The avatar can defeat enemies and vases using the `sword`, which plays a significant role in gaining score points.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to collect keys to access goals and score points by:\n1. Completing small goals for +1 score each.\n2. Completing large goals for +10 score each.\n3. Defeating enemies and vases for additional points.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Winning**: The player wins if all instances of the `smallgoal` or `largegoal` are defeated (tracked by `SpriteCounter`).\n- **Losing**: The player loses if the `avatar` sprite is destroyed (tracked by `SpriteCounter`).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Map Exploration**: Carefully explore the map while avoiding enemy encounters until you are adequately equipped or ready to fight.\n2. **Key Collection**: Prioritize collecting `key` sprites. This will allow you to use `withkey` capabilities to access the goals.\n3. **Combat Readiness**: Focus on defeating enemies using the `sword` to build your score and protect your avatar.\n4. **Resource Management**: Manage your health and ammunition wisely while engaging enemies and obstacles.\n5. **Goal Strategy**: Decide whether to focus on the smaller goals early for quick points or exclusively target the larger goals for maximum scoring efficiency.\n6. **Path Clearance**: Clear out blocks (like `vases` and `enemies`) in strategic placements to create an easier path towards the goals.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo succeed in this game, players should balance between exploration, combat, and goal completion. Staying agile and responsive to enemy dynamics while accumulating resources will ensure better chances of achieving both the small and large goals.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nvase -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> $\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> *\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> $\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> .\nrow=8, col=4 -> $\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> .\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> #\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w",

Here are some relevant observations:\n\n- Directly above the avatar at (9, 10) is a wall (`w`), so movement up is blocked.\n- Directly below the avatar at (11, 10) is also a wall (`w`), blocking down movement.\n- To the left at (10, 9), there is an empty space (`.`), allowing for leftward movement.\n- To the right at (10, 11) is a small goal (`&`), which can be beneficial for scoring points.\n\nGiven that I need to change my action based on the avatar's position not changing last time, I should prioritize moving towards the goal located to the right (10, 11). \n\nI choose to move right:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to make progress towards achieving one of the game's goals, which aligns well with the strategy of goal completion for scoring points.",
