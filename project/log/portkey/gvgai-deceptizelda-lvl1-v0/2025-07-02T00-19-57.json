    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\nBased on the given rules and level layout, here\u2019s an analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre\nThe game appears to be an **action-adventure** or **puzzle platformer**. It combines elements of exploration, resource management (keys, goals), and combat against enemies.\n\n### Mechanics\n- **Player Interaction:** \n  - The player controls an avatar that can defeat enemies and interact with various objects.\n  - The player can collect keys to unlock doors (goals) and defeat enemies using a sword.\n  \n- **Goals and Objects:**\n  - Small goals (green doors) and large goals (gold doors) act as targets that yield different scores upon interaction.\n  - Key collection is crucial to access certain doors.\n  - Enemies vary in behavior and speed, affecting how the player navigates the environment.\n  \n- **Enemy Types:**\n  - Three types of monsters: \n    - **Quick Monster (bat)** \u2013 Fast and frequent.\n    - **Normal Monster (spider)** \u2013 Moderate speed with a longer cooldown.\n    - **Slow Monster (scorpion)** \u2013 Slow but higher constitution.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective of the game is to collect a certain number of goals to win, indicated by the SpriteCounter for small and large goals. Points are scored from defeating enemies and interacting with goals.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Conditions:** \n  - The player wins by interacting with a specified number of small and large goals (e.g., making the SpriteCounter for those goals reach a certain amount).\n- **Loss Conditions:** \n  - The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is killed (SpriteCounter for the avatar indicates loss).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Key Collection:** \n   - Prioritize finding and collecting keys to open doors. This will enable access to various score-boosting goals.\n  \n2. **Enemy Engagement:**\n   - Evaluate when to engage enemies. Use the sword effectively to gain points but avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to losing health or being defeated.\n   - Focus on killing weaker enemies first to build confidence and score.\n\n3. **Navigate the Level:**\n   - Explore the level carefully. Identify where small and large goals are located and plan a route that allows access to them while avoiding strong enemies.\n   - Utilize the walls for cover while navigating through enemy territory.\n\n4. **Score Maximization:**\n   - Aim for large goals first if keys are available. Since they offer a higher score for completion, they can significantly boost your point total.\n   - Do not ignore smaller goals, as they still contribute to winning conditions.\n\n5. **Health Management:**\n   - Avoid direct confrontation with enemies unless necessary, especially if low on health. Use the environment strategically to dodge and retreat when overwhelmed.\n\nBy using these strategies and understanding the mechanics, players can optimize their approach to achieving victory in the game while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor smallgoal -> 'g'\nfloor largegoal -> 'l'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nfloor vase -> 'v'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\nkey -> '@'\nlargegoal -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsmallgoal -> '&'\nvase -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nwithkey -> 's'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> w\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> w\nrow=2, col=8 -> w\nrow=2, col=9 -> w\nrow=2, col=10 -> w\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> $\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> *\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> *\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> w\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> w\nrow=6, col=3 -> $\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> w\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> *\nrow=7, col=11 -> *\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> .\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> $\nrow=8, col=4 -> .\nrow=8, col=5 -> .\nrow=8, col=6 -> .\nrow=8, col=7 -> .\nrow=8, col=8 -> .\nrow=8, col=9 -> .\nrow=8, col=10 -> *\nrow=8, col=11 -> *\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\nrow=9, col=0 -> w\nrow=9, col=1 -> .\nrow=9, col=2 -> w\nrow=9, col=3 -> w\nrow=9, col=4 -> w\nrow=9, col=5 -> w\nrow=9, col=6 -> w\nrow=9, col=7 -> w\nrow=9, col=8 -> w\nrow=9, col=9 -> w\nrow=9, col=10 -> w\nrow=9, col=11 -> w\nrow=9, col=12 -> w\nrow=10, col=0 -> w\nrow=10, col=1 -> .\nrow=10, col=2 -> .\nrow=10, col=3 -> .\nrow=10, col=4 -> .\nrow=10, col=5 -> .\nrow=10, col=6 -> .\nrow=10, col=7 -> .\nrow=10, col=8 -> k\nrow=10, col=9 -> .\nrow=10, col=10 -> s\nrow=10, col=11 -> &\nrow=10, col=12 -> w\nrow=11, col=0 -> w\nrow=11, col=1 -> w\nrow=11, col=2 -> w\nrow=11, col=3 -> w\nrow=11, col=4 -> w\nrow=11, col=5 -> w\nrow=11, col=6 -> w\nrow=11, col=7 -> w\nrow=11, col=8 -> w\nrow=11, col=9 -> w\nrow=11, col=10 -> w\nrow=11, col=11 -> w\nrow=11, col=12 -> w\nrow=12, col=0 -> w\nrow=12, col=1 -> w\nrow=12, col=2 -> w\nrow=12, col=3 -> w\nrow=12, col=4 -> w\nrow=12, col=5 -> w\nrow=12, col=6 -> #\nrow=12, col=7 -> w\nrow=12, col=8 -> w\nrow=12, col=9 -> w\nrow=12, col=10 -> w\nrow=12, col=11 -> w\nrow=12, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "Evaluating the current state of the game based on the provided map, my avatar (represented by 'a') is positioned and must make a strategic decision regarding movement or interaction with objects. Since no specific position of the avatar is given in the provided state, I'll assume it's in a neutral position to consider the surroundings strategically.\n\nFrom examining the layout, I note that:\n- There are several enemies represented by '$' (normal monster) and other items of interest including small goals '&', large goals '#', and keys '+'.\n- The avatar has a sword 'k' and is able to defeat enemies to gain points and score via interaction with goals.\n\nGiven the overall objective to maximize score and progress towards the winning condition, my action decision should focus on either approaching a goal or engaging with an enemy.\n\nSince I don\u2019t know the current position of the avatar, I will first check for an adverse position or the immediate area that might provide advantageous actions.\n\nI see a nearby enemy at coordinates (3,3) as well as some potential goals at (10,11) and (12,6). An optimal move could involve approaching the goal at (10,11) to gain a point.\n\nThus, I will choose to move my avatar to the right.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the smart strategy to gather goals, promoting an increase in score, while also navigating away from enemies at least for now.
