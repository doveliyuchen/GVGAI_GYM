It combines elements of puzzle-solving with platforming mechanics, where players navigate through and interact with various terrain types and obstacles to achieve specific objectives.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- **Sprites and Resources:** \n  - The game features various sprites like `avatar`, `water`, `mud`, `fire`, `key`, `door`, and `exit`, each with distinct functions and interactions.\n  - The player-controlled character (the avatar) can collect keys, boots, and chips while traversing different types of terrain. \n- **Terrain Interactions:** \n  - Terrain types like water, mud, and fire have unique effects on the avatar. For example, mud kills the avatar, and water can transform crates into mud.\n- **Resource Management:** \n  - The avatar has to manage their resources (keys, boots) to unlock doors and progress. Some doors kill the avatar if they lack the required key.\n- **Objective Interaction:**\n  - Collecting chips increases the score, while some interactions like stepping on crates allow repositioning.\n- **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n  - The game ends when either the avatar is killed or the avatar reaches the exit. The player wins if the exit exists without the avatar being killed.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective is to navigate through a maze-like environment to reach the exit while collecting keys and avoiding hazards. The player must successfully manage resources to unlock various doors, enabling further progress toward the exit.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the `exit` sprite without the avatar being killed.\n- **Loss Condition:** Avatar is killed by environmental hazards or failing to manage resources (having insufficient keys or encountering deadly terrain).\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Explore and Memorize:** \n   - Start by exploring each area carefully, memorizing the layout and where resources, doors, and hazards are located.\n   \n2. **Resource Management:**\n   - Prioritize collecting keys and boots; they are essential for navigating specific doors and challenges.\n   - Be cautious with resource limits; check how many of each resource you have, especially when facing doors.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:**\n   - Move cautiously in areas with mud and fire. Make sure you have the required boots to safely traverse water or fire.\n   - Identify patterns and find safe routes to minimize damage and avoid death.\n\n4. **Use Crates Wisely:**\n   - Utilize the crates to bounce forward, opening opportunities for exploration while avoiding immediate threats.\n   - If necessary, use crates to block paths or create barriers to temporarily halt hazards from reaching the avatar.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route to the Exit:**\n   - Always keep your end goal (exit) in mind while navigating. Before unlocking doors, ensure you have the necessary resources to pass through.\n   - Don\u2019t rush. Take time to evaluate paths leading to the exit to avoid dead ends or getting stuck.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively manage their resources, avoid hazards, and navigate through the environment to achieve the game's objective successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
