Players navigate through a grid-based environment filled with obstacles and interactive sprites.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:** The game features various types of sprites including:\n   - **Immovable Objects:** Walls, water, mud, fire, doors, and crates that serve as obstacles or interactable elements.\n   - **Keys and Resources:** Different colored keys allow access to corresponding doors and represent resources that the player can collect.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character interacts with the environment, collecting resources, avoiding obstacles, and navigating the grid.\n   \n2. **Interactions:** The game has a complex interaction system where:\n   - The avatar can collect keys and resources by moving over them.\n   - Certain interactions change the avatar\u2019s status (e.g., water, mud, and fire can be lethal if the avatar lacks specific resources like flippers or fireboots).\n   - Interaction with gates necessitates a specific resource limit (e.g., chips) to progress.\n   - Specific doors (red, green, blue, yellow) can be opened by using the corresponding keys, but there is a limit on the number of times they can be used.\n\n3. **Scoring:** Collecting chips and certain resources gives the player score points; scoring mechanics are tied to the interaction system.\n\n**Objective:**\n- The primary objective is to navigate through the level, collect necessary keys and resources while avoiding hazards (like water, mud, and fire), and reach the exit (located within the level) to win.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit. The counter for the exit sprite must hit zero for the game to recognize this condition.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar sprite counter drops to zero (i.e., if the avatar dies).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management:** \n   - Prioritize collecting keys and chips as they allow access to critical areas and confer score bonuses.\n   - Be mindful of the limited usage for each key and ensure to utilize them wisely when approaching their respective doors.\n\n2. **Path Planning:**\n   - Before moving, analyze the layout and determine the best route to collect keys and reach the exit efficiently. Plan movements to avoid hazards (e.g., water, mud, fire) that could be fatal if you lack the appropriate resources.\n\n3. **Avoid Unnecessary Losses:**\n   - Avoid actions that could lead to losing resources or the avatar itself (e.g., getting stuck without required footwear for certain areas).\n   - Utilize crates effectively to navigate obstacles and manage the environment to your advantage (e.g., bouncing forward).\n\n4. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore and familiarize yourself with each level. Understanding the location of resources, doors, and hazards will enhance your chances of success.\n\n5. **Use Crates Wisely:**\n   - Crates can be used creatively to navigate or manipulate the environment. Use them to bounce or clear pathways when needed.\n\nAdopting this strategic approach will help players successfully navigate the game's challenges, maximize their score, and reach the exit efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
