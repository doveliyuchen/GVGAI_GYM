The use of various keys, doors, and environmental hazards suggests a mixture of solving challenges while navigating through a maze-like level.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites:** The game has several types of sprites, including the player avatar, interactive objects (like keys, doors, crates), and environmental hazards (such as water, mud, and fire).\n- **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can move and interact with objects. For example, the avatar can collect keys, exit through the exit sprite, and interact with crates to bounce or manipulate other objects.\n- **Resource Management:** Keys and boots are resources for the player. Collecting these resources is essential for overcoming obstacles (like doors) within the game.\n- **Transformation and Hazards:** Certain interactions can transform sprites (e.g., crates into mud) and introduce hazards (e.g., water and fire that can kill the avatar if they lack the appropriate resources).\n\n**Objectives:**\n- The main aim is to navigate the maze, collect necessary resources (keys, boots), avoid hazards, and reach the exit.\n- The player must strategically use collected keys to open corresponding doors that may block their path.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit sprite while still having the avatar sprite intact.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is killed (sprite counter for avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Awareness:** Always keep an eye on how many resources the avatar has. Collect keys, boots, and chips efficiently since they are crucial for interacting with doors and avoiding hazards.\n\n2. **Plan Movements:** Pay careful attention to the layout of the level. Identify which doors can be opened with the keys you have, and try to plan a route that allows for the collection of resources before reaching those doors.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Recognize and anticipate hazards like mud and fire. Make sure that you have the necessary resources (like fireboots or flippers) before navigating these areas. \n\n4. **Utilize Crates:** Use crates strategically to bounce and reach areas that may not be accessible otherwise. Crates can also be used to change the state of other sprites.\n\n5. **Check Positions:** Regularly observe the arrangement of walls and doors. Some door interactions may require backtracking or other strategies, so consider how the avatar can change states to utilize or avoid them.\n\n6. **Prioritize Collectibles:** Focus on collecting chips and boot resources as they can provide significant tactical advantages, both for scoring and as prerequisites for moving through certain areas.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, players can navigate through the game's challenges, avoid pitfalls, and efficiently reach the exit while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

It is essential to start collecting resources for further progress. The nearest chip is located at (row 2, col 4), and there are some keys and boot resources in the lower rows.\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\n1. The immediate surroundings are clear, so the avatar has the opportunity to move.\n2. Since the avatar can only move to adjacent tiles and we want to start collecting resources right away, the movement towards the bottom row (especially in the direction where chips or keys are located) would be prudent.\n\n**Next Move:**\nThe best move is to go down to (row 9, col 2), which remains free and provides access to potential further movement options closer to the key and chip locations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next action will be:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action takes the avatar down, allowing it to gather resources more effectively in subsequent turns.",
