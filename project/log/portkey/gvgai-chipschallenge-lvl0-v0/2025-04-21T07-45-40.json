    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nBased on the provided game rules and level layout, here's a comprehensive analysis of the game:\n\n### Game Genre:\nThe game appears to belong to the **puzzle/adventure** genre. Players navigate through a maze-like environment, solve puzzles, and use specific resources (like keys and boots) to progress. The emphasis on collecting resources and unlocking doors suggests it may also have elements akin to **metroidvania** or **platformer** games.\n\n### Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: Various sprites are both obstacles (walls, water, fire, etc.) and resources (keys, boots, chips). Each type of sprite has unique interactions with the avatar.\n2. **Movement and Interactions**: The avatar can collect keys, boots, and other items, which are necessary for survival and progression. The avatar is capable of interacting with crates and walls to navigate the environment.\n   - **Keys** open doors; if the avatar interacts with a door and doesn\u2019t have the required key, they may lose resources or even be killed, depending on the door's type.\n   - **Mud** and **water** can be dangerous; the avatar must possess specific items like flippers to traverse water or risk being killed when walking into mud.\n   - **Chips** are collectible resources yielding points, with a limit on how many can be collected.\n3. **Resource Management**: Players must manage their acquired keys and other resources to access particular doors. Each color door requires a corresponding key and can incapacitate the player if they attempt to cross without it.\n4. **Death and Respawn**: Mortal dangers (like mud, water, or fire) will kill the avatar if the player does not possess the necessary resources (e.g., fire boots for fire).\n\n### Objective:\nThe main objectives are:\n- Collect resources (keys, boots, chips) to progress through the level.\n- Unlock specific doors to access further areas, ultimately reaching the exit.\n- Maximize the score through resource collection (chips and specific boot acquisition).\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning**: The player wins by reaching and interacting with the exit sprite, which awards a score and terminates the game.\n- **Losing**: The game is lost if the avatar is killed or if it reaches zero count (e.g., if the avatar sprite count is reduced to zero during gameplay).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting resources before interacting with doors. Pay attention to the types of keys acquired since many doors require specific keys to open.\n2. **Exploration**: Move through the environment cautiously. Use the crates to bounce forward and navigate around obstacles, and be mindful of mud and water locations.\n3. **Prioritize Objectives**: Aim to collect chips for score increments but prioritize keys and boots for unlocking doors and accessing new sections.\n4. **Plan Routes**: When encountering a new section, plan the route based on the resources available. Determine if the doors can be managed with the keys at hand before proceeding deeper into the level.\n5. **Avoid Conflict**: Engage with obstacles like water and fire only after securing necessary resources (such as flippers or fire boots). Take time to develop a path that circumvents potentially lethal sprites until equipped.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can navigate through the levels efficiently, maximize their score, and ultimately reach the exit safely.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game.

The key immediate resources are:\n  - **Keys** (denoted by / as `*`)\n  - **Boots** (denoted by / as `$`)\n  - **Chips** (denoted by / as `c`)\n  - **Doors and Obstacles** (like walls `g`, various dangers, etc.)\n  \n### Next Steps Strategy:\n1. **Assess Immediate Resources**:\n    - Examine the immediate surroundings to identify any available keys ($), chips (c), and resources immediately nearby.\n    \n2. **Plan Movement**:\n    - The avatar is currently in a space surrounded by both interactive and non-interactive elements. \n    - Focus on moving to collect the nearest key (`$` icon), located nearby within a few moves.\n  \n3. **Evaluate Potential Risks**:\n    - Identify any potential dangers in the environment, such as walls (`g`), access to other areas with doors, and other sprites that could be lethal (like fire or mud).\n    - Ensure the navigation plan avoids dangerous sprites until resources are secured.\n\n4. **Resource Collection Priority**:\n    - First, look to collect any boots (`$`) or keys (`*`) within reach.\n    - The immediate goal should be moving toward the **closest** collectible sprite without moving into a wall or other dangers.\n\n5. **Use Tools and Obstacles Wisely**:\n    - Utilize maze-like structures and available pathways effectively. \n    - If there are crates or other objects nearby that can assist in movement or create a buffer to reach a key or boot, plan to incorporate those into your movement.\n  \n6. **Engage with Doors**:\n    - Upon securing a key or boots, evaluate available doors that can be opened with your collections.\n    - Prioritize using the keys to unlock doors that lead to potentially more resource collections or score opportunities.\n\n7. **Continue Exploration**:\n    - Once resources are collected, keep exploring the area to uncover chips (`c`) or additional keys that may unlock further paths.\n    - Keep an eye on the areas that may require specific resources (like fire or water protection) as they will dictate your route throughout the game.\n\n### Sample Movement Plan:\n- Move towards the immediate nearest `$` key: **from `@` to `$`**\n- Once the key is collected, assess surroundings again for further moves.\n- If more keys are available and can be reached safely, plan to them while avoiding dangerous tiles (denoted by fire or mud symbols in your environment).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy focusing on immediate collection goals, carefully planning your route, avoiding hazards, and using resources wisely, you can create effective strategies for future exploration within the maze-like game environment. Adapt your plans based on resources as they are gathered and always be cautious about interacting with dangerous sprites.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
