Each interaction affects movement or resource availability.\n- **Resource Gathering**: Players can collect keys, chips, and boots, which are crucial for progressing through levels and overcoming obstacles.\n- **Interaction Behaviors**: Specific interactions allow players to unlock doors, avoid dangers, or manipulate the environment (bounce off crates, transform water to mud).\n\n#### Objectives\n- The primary objective is to navigate through the level, acquire keys and resources, and reach the exit while avoiding death from environmental hazards (e.g., mud, water, fire).\n- Collect as many chips as possible, as they contribute to the score but may also influence interactions with certain gates.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Player wins by reaching the exit sprite, which also contributes to the score.\n- **Loss Condition**: Player loses if the avatar sprite counter reaches zero, indicating the avatar has been eliminated.\n\n#### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting keys and chips early in the level. This will prepare you for interactions with the doors.\n2. **Plan Your Route**: Before moving, analyze the level layout to avoid running into hazards like water and fire, as they can lead to instant loss if the required resources (e.g., flippers or fireboots) are not available.\n3. **Use Crates Strategically**: Use crates to bounce forward and change the spatial dynamics in your favor. They can also be used to undo certain interactions that might hinder progress.\n4. **Prioritize Keys**: Attempt to gather keys required for the different colored doors. Each door grants access to new areas and can influence your score positively.\n5. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks**: Don't engage with sections of the level that pose a significant risk unless you have the required tools (flippers for water, fireboots for fire).\n6. **Watch for Resources Limitation**: Some interactions may depend on you having a certain resource. Keep a close count of your resources and avoid doors that demand too many if you might need them elsewhere.\n7. **Always Seek the Exit**: Your end goal is to reach the exit. Align your resources and movements to ensure that, upon reaching the exit, you maximize your score by collecting any last chips along the way.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively navigate the challenges presented in the game while achieving the primary objective of reaching the exit and maximizing your score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
