Players must navigate through a level filled with interactive elements, requiring them to solve puzzles and avoid hazards while gathering resources and reaching an exit. \n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprite Types**: The game contains various sprite types such as:\n  - **Immovable Obstacles**: Walls, floors, water, mud, fire, and doors.\n  - **Resource Collectibles**: Keys, boots, and chips that enhance ability or score.\n  - **Interactive Elements**: Crates that can be moved to manipulate the environment.\n  \n- **Interactions**: The avatar can interact with sprites in several ways:\n  - Collect resources (keys, boots, chips).\n  - Transform sprites (water to mud).\n  - Face penalties for incorrect interactions (contact with mud, fire).\n\n#### Objectives\nThe main objective is to reach the **exit** while collecting resources necessary to interact with doors and avoid hazards that can destroy the avatar. Additionally, players need to gather the right **keys** to open the corresponding doors.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar sprite is destroyed (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n#### Level Layout Overview\nThe map indicated seems to contain walls (w), pathways (.), and various objects (c for chip, r for red door, b for boot, etc.). The level layout suggests multiple pathways and possibly hidden areas encouraging exploration.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**:\n   - Collect all chips and keys - they are crucial for progressing through doors and enhancing score.\n   - Prioritize collecting boots to gain additional score benefits early on.\n\n2. **Environmental Navigation**:\n   - Use crates wisely to clear paths or access areas.\n   - Be cautious near the water and fire; ensure you possess the right resources (flippers and fire boots) before approaching.\n\n3. **Observe and Plan**:\n   - Carefully observe the layout. Identify possible dangers in advance (like mud or fire).\n   - Look for patterns or sequences in modifiers, especially for the doors which require specific keys.\n\n4. **Advance with Caution**:\n   - Before advancing through a door, ensure you have the necessary key. Avoid unnecessary deaths which can lead to game over.\n   - If you lose resources (via the gates or doors), try to work around until you can reacquire them.\n\n5. **Clear Inventory with Strategy**:\n   - Manage your interactions to minimize losses. Certain interactions can undo entire runs if done incorrectly.\n\n6. **End Game Strategy**:\n   - Before heading to the exit, ensure you have the highest possible score by collecting as many resources as possible.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and understanding the mechanics at play, players can navigate the puzzles effectively to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

    "content": "Given the current state, my avatar is positioned at (8, 5). The surrounding context shows that there are walls (g) nearby, and multiple items like chips ($) and keys (b, r) on the map, giving emphasis on collecting resources. The goal is to find the exit (%) and efficiently navigate to it while collecting necessary items.\n\nFrom my position at (8, 5), the available directions are:\n\n- Up (7, 5): Empty space (.)\n- Down (9, 5): Wall (g)\n- Left (8, 4): Empty space (.)\n- Right (8, 6): Empty space (.)\n\nMoving up or left would lead to empty spaces. I could further explore these areas for possible paths and items since moving down is blocked by a wall.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven that there are no immediate threats and I can only potentially explore (up or left), I will choose to move **up**. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up allows me to check the nearby resources and possible pathways leading further into the level. This aligns with the strategy of resource management and environmental navigation.",
