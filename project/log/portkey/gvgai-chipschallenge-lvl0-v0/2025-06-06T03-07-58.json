    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**\nThe game appears to be a puzzle platformer, where players navigate through a maze-like environment filled with obstacles, keys, and doors, while managing resources and collecting items.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Sprites**: The environment is built with various immovable sprites (walls, doors, fire, etc.) and interactions that the player can manipulate using an avatar.\n- **Resource Management**: The avatar collects resources (keys, chips, boots, flippers) that are necessary for progressing through the game and unlocking different areas.\n- **Killing Conditions**: Certain conditions result in the avatar being killed if they lack necessary resources (e.g., flippers to cross water or fireboots to cross fire).\n- **Interactions**: The avatar can interact with various objects\u2014including keys, crates, and others\u2014to either collect resources, change status, or overcome obstacles.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main goal of the game is to navigate through levels, collect necessary resources, and reach the exit while avoiding hazards. \n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win**: Reaching the exit sprite before the avatar is killed by losing all health.\n- **Loss**: The game ends if the avatar is killed (i.e., if it reaches a sprite counter of 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Collection**: Prioritize collecting keys and essential resources (like flippers and fire boots) early on. Identify which doors require which keys and ensure you have the right ones before attempting to pass through.\n  \n2. **Navigational Caution**: Move cautiously through the environment. Pay attention to the surroundings, specifically hazards like water and fire, to avoid losing the avatar.\n\n3. **Planning Moves**: Use the crates to manipulate your position and possibly create pathways. If you find yourself in a tight spot or need to backtrack, be prepared to undo your moves effectively.\n\n4. **Efficiency in Movement**: Focus on creating efficient routes to collect resources and avoid wasting moves. Avoid unnecessary interactions that can lead to complications unless they provide a direct benefit.\n\n5. **Tunnel Vision on Hazards**: Be very aware of resources required to pass hazards. Always check what you need before engaging with dangerous areas.\n\n6. **Level Familiarity**: Familiarize yourself with the layout as you progress through levels. Map out known areas and identified key locations (like doors and resource drops) for easier navigation in subsequent playthroughs.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, players can effectively navigate through levels and manage the challenges presented by the game's mechanics, ultimately increasing their chances of reaching the exit successfully.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

The tiles down (8, 3) and up (6, 3) are also empty (.) as indicated in the state mapping. \n\nThere is a chip at (7, 12), which could be a resource worth collecting since collecting resources is part of the overall strategy. \n\nSince our avatar's position didn't change from the previous state, we will need to act. \n\nAfter considering the options, moving **right** (to (7, 4)) will not lead us closer to any resources or hazards but allows for more movement flexibility afterward. Moving left could similarly just lead to an empty tile but then we'll still have movement options available.\n\nIf we move to collect the chip right away, we will want to move toward (7, 12). However, for now, let's keep our strategy focused by making our first move towards (7, 4) to open possibilities for subsequent actions.\n\nI will choose:\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to better positions us for either collecting resources or exploring further without risking immediate danger.",
