    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Genre\nBased on the provided rules, this game appears to be a **puzzle/platformer**. Players navigate through a maze-like environment, solving puzzles to reach specific objectives while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game consists of various types of sprites, including:\n   - **Obstacles**: Wall, mud, fire, and water, with specific interactions.\n   - **Resources**: Keys (different colors), boots, and chips that support gameplay and can be collected by the avatar.\n   - **Doors/Gates**: That require particular resources to pass or can be obstacles if certain conditions are not met.\n   - **Avatar**: The main character controlled by the player, which interacts with other sprites.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - Collecting resources (keys, chips, boots).\n   - Interacting with obstacles leads to transformations or death (e.g., water turning crates to mud, or the avatar dying in mud or fire without the necessary equipment).\n   - Use of keys to unlock doors; some doors kill the avatar if the required key isn't collected.\n   - The avatar can also bounce off crates and interact with gates depending on their resources.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to **reach the exit** while managing resources and avoiding hazards. Collecting keys and other items is necessary to unlock specific doors, while surviving environmental hazards is crucial.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins if the avatar reaches the exit sprite.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unfavorably if the avatar is killed (i.e., the sprite counter for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Suggested Strategy\n1. **Explore Thoroughly**: The game layout suggests a maze; take time to explore each area to collect keys and boots. Items such as chips also add to the score, so collect these where possible.\n  \n2. **Plan Resource Management**: Before interacting with doors, always check what resources are available. Make sure to have the necessary key for the door you plan to pass through.\n\n3. **Use Obstacles Wisely**: Understand how sprites like mud and fire can affect your avatar. Collecting the right items (like flippers or fire boots) will allow the avatar to safely pass through hazardous areas.\n\n4. **Sequence of Actions**: Be strategic about the order in which you interact with elements. For example, smashing crates might reach specific resources without risking death from hazards.\n\n5. **Return and Retry**: If the avatar runs out of keys or is killed, use checkpoints or previous paths to reclaim lost resources. This may involve retracing steps to find resources you might have missed.\n\nBy adopting this approach, players can navigate through the game effectively, maximizing score and minimizing risks associated with gameplay.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
