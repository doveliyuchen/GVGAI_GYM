Players must solve challenges by leveraging keys and other items to progress through a level filled with various hazards.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game utilizes numerous sprites, including obstacles (walls, water, mud, fire), resources (keys, boots, chips), and an avatar (player character). Movement and interactions between these sprites form the core mechanics of the gameplay.\n  \n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect resources (keys, boots).\n   - Specific conditions are set for moving through doors; the avatar must have the corresponding key to pass.\n   - Certain resources can change the state of other sprites (e.g., crates transform into mud when interacting with water).\n   - Players can navigate hazards that require specific items (e.g., flippers for water, fireboots for fire).\n\n3. **Resource Management**: Key resources are limited in count, and players must be strategic about when and where to use them.\n\n4. **Movability**: The avatar can interact with certain elements to move, bounce, or undo previous actions. Certain actions (like stepping back) suggest a physics-based component to navigation.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, collect resources, unlock doors using the collected keys, and ultimately reach the exit while avoiding death from hazards (like mud, water, and fire).\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game by reaching the exit.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game ends unsuccessfully if the avatar dies (SpriteCounter for avatar reaches 0).\n\n#### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore**: The first step is to explore the area to locate resources, obstacles, and pathways while avoiding immediate hazards. \n\n2. **Resource Management**: Keep track of collected keys and strive to manage the inventory wisely. Avoid using key resources on doors unnecessarily if there are alternative pathways or if the resource limits are already reached.\n\n3. **Use Items Strategically**: Pay attention to item interactions to navigate through the level effectively. For instance:\n   - Use flippers when dealing with water.\n   - Equip fireboots before attempting to cross fire hazards.\n   - Utilize the bounce mechanics of crates to facilitate movement when stuck.\n\n4. **Plan Moves**: Think ahead about how to use the keys and other resources to maximize your chances for success. Preemptively collecting resources needed for other paths can save time and prevent multiple retraces.\n\n5. **Avoid Hazards**: Be aware of the limitations set by resources (like the need for flippers in water), and always aim to avoid areas where death is certain (like mud without the right resource).\n\n6. **Monitor Score**: Keep an eye on the score changes from collecting chips and using keys. Certain decisions offer score boosts, which can be beneficial for enhancing progress or potentially unlocking further levels.\n\nBy following these steps and adapting based on what you discover in each level, players can navigate the challenges and maximize their chances of success in reaching the exit.\n\nYou are an intelligent agent controlling the avatar in a grid-based video game. Interpret the environment and act accordingly.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\ng.$.g#...eg.$.g -> '@'\ng...c..$..@...g -> '#'\ng.w.@.....c.w.g -> '$'\nggg.$.g%g.$.ggg -> '%'\nggg...ggg...ggg -> '&'\nggggg$.a.$ggggg -> '*'\nggggg*g&g*ggggg -> 'g'\nggggg.$g$.ggggg -> 'b'\nggggg..g..ggggg -> 'c'\nggggg.bgb.ggggg -> 'd'\nggggggggggggggg -> 'e'\nggggggrgrgggggg -> 'f'\n\n=== Current State ===\ne\n&\n%\ng\n$\n@\n*\n@\n#\nf\nc\nb\nd\ne\n\n=== Last Reward ===\nN/A\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n### High-Level Strategy for Next Steps in Game\n\nGiven the current state of the game and the previous analysis, here\u2019s a structured strategy for progressing through the level:\n\n#### Immediate Assessment\n1. **Current Position & Resources**: \n   - Avatar is represented as **@**.\n   - Key and resource locations need to be assessed for accessibility and necessity.\n   - The avatar has access to several items which must be utilized wisely (e.g., **$** indicating items to collect).\n\n2. **Goal & Hazards**:\n   - The goal is to navigate the environment safely, avoiding hazards indicated as **g** (gas/fire) or potentially other blocks that may be challenging to navigate.\n\n3. **Current Layout**:\n   - The visible layout features walls (**g**), resources (**$**, **%**, **#**, **&**, *****) and other sprites that need to be strategically managed (like the **c** for collectible chips).\n\n### Proposed Steps:\n\n#### 1. **Resource Evaluation**:\n   - **Identify Collectibles**: Prioritize collecting visible resources:\n     - **Ensure to collect chips** (represented as **$**) for points.\n     - Examine if there are keys or special items (e.g., **&**, **%**) that can be more beneficial for future moves.\n\n#### 2. **Utilizing Resources**:\n   - **Interactions**: Identify vital resources required for your movement. Specifically:\n     - **Keys** for opening doors where necessary.\n     - **Boots or swimming gear** if water or hazardous elements become involved shortly.\n  \n#### 3. **Plan the Route**:\n   - **Navigate to Collect Items**: Move towards any visible collectibles in the vicinity:\n     - Collect nearby **$** you encounter along the way. \n     - Prioritize working towards **c** blocks as these might provide a score boost.\n  \n#### 4. **Avoiding Hazards**:\n   - Make strategic movements to avoid immediate hazards. Steer clear of large clusters of **g** or potential traps.\n\n#### 5. **Expanded Exploration**:\n   - Once immediate items are collected, look for pathways that may allow you to explore adjacent areas to acquire additional benefits, such as evading hazards or securing new keys.\n\n#### 6. **Test Interactions**:\n   - Experiment with items, using collected keys to open doors only if necessary. Create pathways to traverse through different areas without exhausting key resources without significant payoff.\n   \n#### 7. **Update Strategy Based on Progress**:\n   - As you explore, adapt your strategy by assessing what new items or hazards you encounter. If you encounter more advanced obstacles requiring rare keys, reconsider the route you\u2019re taking.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following this structured approach to evaluating resources, planning interactions, avoiding hazards, and adjusting your strategy based on evolving game dynamics, the avatar can progress further, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the level and achievement of the game's objectives.\n\n\nPlease choose the best action and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```",
