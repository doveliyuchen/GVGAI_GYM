    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Analysis\n\n**Genre:**  \nThe game appears to be a **puzzle platformer** or **adventure game** with elements of resource management and item collection, commonly found in retro-style games.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n- **Sprites and Resources:** The game features various sprites including environmental elements (water, mud, fire), interactive objects (keys, doors, boots), and collectibles (chips). Players can interact with these elements to progress.\n- **Avatar Interaction:** The player controls an avatar that can collect resources like keys and boots, which are essential for opening specific doors and navigating obstacles.\n- **Movement and Interaction:** The avatar can bounce off crates, collect chips for score, and must avoid hazards like water and fire unless they have the necessary resources (flippers and fireboots).\n- **Resource Management:** Certain doors can only be passed if the avatar possesses a corresponding key (red, blue, green, yellow) and meets the specified limits for each key type. \n\n**Objectives:**  \n- **Primary goal:** The main objective is to reach the exit point while collecting as many chips as possible.\n- **Secondary goals:** Acquiring keys and boots to open doors. Properly managing resources to avoid death from water or fire is also crucial.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the exit sprite, which grants a score change of +5.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game ends if the avatar sprite counter reaches 0, meaning the avatar has been eliminated.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Resource Management:**\n   - Focus on collecting keys and boots as soon as possible. Each of them enhances your ability to navigate the level.\n   - Aim to manage your resources wisely; do not waste keys on doors unless you are certain that you will need to pass through them.\n\n2. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Analyze the level layout to create an efficient path towards the exit. Check where the doors are located and which keys are required.\n   - Identify crates that can be interacted with to navigate through the level, using them strategically to jump over obstacles.\n\n3. **Avoiding Hazards:**\n   - Be cautious of environmental hazards like mud, water, and fire. Ensure that you possess the necessary equipment (flippers and fireboots) before attempting to cross these zones.\n\n4. **Collecting Chips:**\n   - Chips contribute to your score; prioritize collecting them when on the way to your objectives. They are particularly valuable and can sometimes influence game mechanics or unlock features.\n\n5. **Tackle Doors Decisively:**\n   - Each colored door requires a specific key. Before proceeding through any door, make sure you have the respective key and understand the consequences (such as potential loss of the key).\n\n6. **Use Undo Mechanics Wisely:**\n   - The game has interactions that suggest some form of \"undo\" mechanic through avatar interaction with crates, walls, and doors. Use this to backtrack and explore different paths as needed without negative consequences.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the core mechanics, you'll improve your chances of successfully navigating the puzzles and reaching the exit efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
