Players must navigate through a grid-based layout, overcome obstacles, collect resources, and solve puzzles to progress through the game.\n\n#### Mechanics:\n1. **Player-Controlled Avatar:** The player controls an avatar that can move across a grid.\n2. **Immovable Sprites:** The game features various immovable objects like walls, doors, and gates, which create barriers the player must navigate.\n3. **Resource Collection:** Players collect different keys and other resources (like chips and boots) that help them unlock doors or provide advantages.\n4. **Transformations and Killing Conditions:** Certain interactions cause the avatar to be \"killed\" or reset based on the resources they possess or lack, adding a layer of strategy to resource management.\n5. **Score System:** Players earn points by collecting certain items, with the exit providing a high score.\n\n#### Objective:\nThe main objective is to navigate through the level, collect necessary resources, unlock doors to progress, and ultimately reach the \"exit\" while maximizing the score.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Winning:** The player wins by getting to the exit. The game ends successfully when the exit sprite is gone (counter reaches 0).\n- **Losing:** The player loses if the avatar sprite reaches a count of 0, meaning the player has either failed to navigate successfully or has run out of necessary resources.\n\n#### Possible Overall Strategy:\n1. **Resource Management:** \n   - Keep track of collected keys and ensure you have the necessary ones for the doors you'll encounter.\n   - Prioritize collecting boots to enhance movement options, and flippers to navigate water areas.\n\n2. **Puzzle Navigation:**\n   - Look at the layout and plan routes that allow you to collect resources while minimizing the risk of running into obstacles that can eliminate your avatar.\n   - Use crates strategically to bounce forward and open paths blocked by certain sprites.\n\n3. **Risk vs. Reward:**\n   - Some doors kill the avatar if insufficient resources are present. Make sure to collect enough resources before attempting to pass through these doors.\n   - Pay attention to the water and fire hazards\u2014ensure you possess the appropriate resources (flippers or fire boots) before crossing these areas.\n\n4. **Exploration:**\n   - Explore all areas to find chips and other collectibles to boost your score.\n   - Check each interaction to understand the implications of resource management and what items you can combine or use for movement.\n\n5. **Path Planning:**\n   - Plan your route carefully to minimize backtracking as the avatar can step back if the resources are not sufficient. Retracing steps can be detrimental.\n   - Identify clusters of resources and obstacles to maximize efficiency in collecting keys and getting to the exit.\n\nBy effectively managing resources, strategically navigating the grid, and planning your moves based on the layout, players can successfully complete the level and maximize their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor

The goal is to maximize score by collecting items and reaching the exit while managing resources effectively.\n\n### Analysis:\n- There is an exit (represented by '%') located at (2, 7).\n- There are collectible chips (represented by '$') scattered in various locations.\n- The avatar is currently on a floor tile (empty space).\n- The surrounding tiles are important for potential movement:\n    - (8, 5): floor (.)\n    - (8, 7): floor (.)\n    - (7, 6): floor (.)\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Movement Options**: The avatar can move left (to (8, 5)), right (to (8, 7)), up (to (7, 6)), or down (to (9, 6)).\n2. **Resource Collection**: Given the awareness of the exit, it's important to explore the road to the exit and collect resources to prepare for obstacles you might encounter.\n3. **Path Planning**: Moving towards the exit and ensuring we collect any available resources on the way makes sense.\n\n### Action Choice:\nThe most promising action is to move **up** to (7, 6), since this leads us one step closer to exploring potential doors and eventually to the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to align with the strategy of exploring towards the exit while collecting resources along the way.",
