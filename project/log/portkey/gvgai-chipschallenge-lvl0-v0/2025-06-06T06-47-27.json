    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### Game Genre\nBased on the provided rules, this game appears to fall into the **puzzle/adventure genre**, combining elements of resource collection, obstacle navigation, and room exploration.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n- **Tiles/Sprites**: The game consists of various sprites (e.g., walls, floors, doors, keys, crates) that serve different purposes. Some sprites are immovable obstacles, while others are interactive elements that provide resources or trigger actions.\n- **Resources**: Players collect resources like keys, boots, and chips, which can be crucial for progressing through levels.\n- **Interactions**: Players interact with objects to bounce, collect items, or be hindered by obstacles. Certain interactions can lead to the transformation of objects or cause character death if conditions are unmet (e.g., interacting with mud/water or lack of required items).\n\n### Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to:\n1. Collect resources (keys, boots, chips).\n2. Navigate through doors to eventually reach the **exit**.\n3. Accumulate points by collecting items and successfully navigating challenges.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- The player wins the game if they reach the **exit** sprite (with a score gain).\n- The game ends in a loss if the player\u2019s avatar is destroyed (SpriteCounter limit for avatar reached).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Resource Management**: Focus on collecting various keys and essential items like flippers and fire boots early on. These are necessary for progressing past certain obstacles.\n2. **Plan Movements**: Carefully plan your movements to avoid getting stuck and to utilize interactive tiles efficiently, such as bouncing off crates while navigating through walls and doors.\n3. **Strategic Item Use**: Use keys wisely as each type of door requires a specific key. Ensure you have the necessary key before attempting to pass through a door.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Steer clear of traps like mud and water without sufficient resources (flippers for water, fire boots for fire). \n5. **Maximize Point Accumulation**: Collect chips and boots to maximize your score, especially since they contribute to the overall score and give you the ability to unlock gates.\n\n### Example of Gameplay Flow\n- Start by exploring the level and identifying immediate key and resource locations.\n- Collect the chip and any available keys while avoiding obstacles that can end the game.\n- Progress through the level will require interacting with crates and strategizing movement to clear paths to doors.\n- Continuously keep track of collected resources and plan routes accordingly to reach the exit with a high score.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding interactions, you can successfully navigate and complete the game\u2019s challenges.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
