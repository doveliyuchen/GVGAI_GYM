The player character (referred to as \"avatar\") interacts with various sprites and navigates through a level filled with obstacles, keys, doors, and other elements that require problem-solving.\n\n### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: There are a variety of sprites including:\n   - **Ground Sprites**: walls, floors, water, mud, and fire which alter the avatar's movement or health.\n   - **Resource Sprites**: keys (different colors), boots, chips which the avatar can collect to progress.\n   - **Door Sprites**: colored doors that require corresponding keys for access.\n   - **Enemy Sprites**: mud and water can kill the avatar if the conditions aren't met.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can collect items (keys, boots, chips) that may be necessary to unlock doors or progress through the level.\n   - The avatar can only pass through certain doors if they possess the corresponding key.\n   - If the avatar touches certain hazards (like mud or water) without the correct resources (like boots or flippers), they will perish.\n   - Collecting chips and navigating through various obstacles to reach an exit is essential.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: The game emphasizes collecting and managing keys and items efficiently; players need to collect keys before attempting to pass through the respective colored doors.\n\n### Objective\n- **Primary Goal**: Navigate through the level, collect resources, avoid hazards, and reach the exit while managing resources effectively.\n- **Collection**: Essential to gather keys and possibly chips for scoring or unlocking new routes.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when the avatar reaches the exit.\n- **Loss Condition**: The game is lost if the avatar dies (SpriteCounter for avatar hits 0).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Start by exploring the level to identify the location of keys, doors, and hazards.\n2. **Resource Collection**: Focus on collecting as many chips and keys as possible early to open pathways later.\n3. **Plan Your Moves**: Before proceeding through doors, ensure you have the corresponding key. If uncertain, backtrack to gather resources before moving forward.\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: Be cautious around mud, water, and fire. Equip resources (boots/flippers) as needed to overcome these obstacles without dying.\n5. **Maximize Score**: Collect chips for scoring while keeping track of the limited number of keys and other resources to avoid dead ends where you will have to restart or backtrack unnecessarily.\n6. **Exit Strategy**: Once you have navigated the level and collected enough resources, plan the safest route to the exit instead of rushing, as any misstep could lead to losing your avatar.\n\nBy effectively utilizing this strategy and managing resources, players can enhance their chances of successfully completing the level while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nwater floor
