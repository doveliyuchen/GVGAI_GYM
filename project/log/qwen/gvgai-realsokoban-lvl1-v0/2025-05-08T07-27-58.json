It involves moving objects (boxes) into specific locations (holes) while navigating through obstacles (walls). The player controls an avatar and must strategically plan their moves to achieve the goal.\n\n#### **Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor/Ground:** Represents walkable areas.\n   - **Hole:** A target location where boxes need to be placed.\n   - **Avatar:** The player-controlled character that can move around the level.\n   - **Box:** Objects that the player needs to push into holes.\n   - **Boxin:** A transformed version of a box when it is successfully placed in a hole.\n   - **Wall:** Immutable barriers that block movement.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls and will \"step back\" if it tries.\n   - Bounding boxes (bboxes) interact with the avatar by bouncing forward, but this doesn't seem directly relevant for solving the puzzle.\n   - If a box is pushed into a hole, it transforms into a \"boxin,\" increasing the score by 1.\n   - If a \"boxin\" is moved off the ground (e.g., back onto regular floor tiles), it reverts to a regular box, decreasing the score by 1.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The player wins when all boxes have been transformed into \"boxins\" (i.e., placed in holes).\n\n#### **Objective**\nThe primary objective is to push all the boxes into the designated holes on the level. Each successful placement earns points, and reverting a box reduces points, so efficiency is key.\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition:** All boxes are placed into holes (sprite count of `box` reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition:** There is no explicit loss condition provided, but running out of moves or undoing too many placements might make completing the level impossible in practice.\n\n#### **Level Layout Explanation**\n```\nwwwwwwwwwwww       // Walls surrounding the level\nw....www...w       // Open space with some walls obstructing paths\nw.**.....wAw       // Two boxes (**), open space, wall, and avatar (A)\nw.*.wooo...w       // One box (*), three holes (ooo), and open space\nw...wwwwwwww       // More walls closing off part of the level\nwwwwwwwwwwww       // Final wall boundary\n```\n\n- The player starts at position `A`.\n- There are three holes (`o`) that need to be filled with boxes (`*`).\n- Obstacles like walls (`w`) restrict movement and require careful planning.\n\n#### **Suggested Overall Strategy**\n1. **Plan Ahead:** Before making any moves, observe the layout of the level. Identify which boxes should go into which holes based on proximity and accessibility.\n   \n2. **Prioritize Accessible Boxes:** Start by pushing boxes that are closest to the holes and least obstructed by walls. This minimizes unnecessary movements and potential undo actions.\n\n3. **Avoid Blocking Paths:** Be cautious not to block your own path or trap boxes in inaccessible areas. Once a box is pushed into a tight spot, it becomes harder to maneuver.\n\n4. **Use Undo Wisely:** While undoing actions is possible (as seen in interactions involving walls and bboxes), excessive use may lead to penalties if boxes revert from holes.\n\n5. **Score Management:** Focus on achieving the win condition first. Although scores increase with correct placements, they decrease with incorrect ones, so accuracy matters more than speed in this case.\n\nBy following these steps, players can efficiently solve the puzzle and achieve victory!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

If the avatar doesn't move, it might be due to a wall or incorrect orientation, so I'll adjust accordingly in the next step.",
