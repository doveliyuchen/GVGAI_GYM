The player must navigate an avatar through a grid-based environment, interacting with objects like boxes and holes, to achieve a specific goal.\n\n---\n\n#### **Mechanics**\n1. **Sprites (Game Objects)**:\n   - **Floor**: A static background tile where movement occurs.\n   - **Hole**: A dark blue trap that destroys boxes when they fall into it, granting the player points.\n   - **Avatar**: The controllable character (a knight) that moves around the level.\n   - **Box**: An object that can be pushed by the avatar. It interacts with walls, other boxes, and holes.\n   - **Wall**: Static barriers that prevent movement.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - If the avatar tries to move into a wall, it steps back (`stepBack`).\n   - When the avatar pushes a box, the box moves forward (`bounceForward`).\n   - If two boxes are pushed against each other near a wall, the action is undone (`undoAll`).\n   - When a box falls into a hole, the box is removed from the game, and the player earns 1 point (`killSprite scoreChange=1`).\n\n3. **Movement**:\n   - The avatar can move in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) on the floor, avoiding walls and manipulating boxes.\n\n---\n\n#### **Objective**\nThe primary objective is to remove all the boxes from the level by pushing them into holes. This is achieved by carefully planning the avatar's movements and interactions with the boxes.\n\n---\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes (`stype=box`) are removed from the level (i.e., their count reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: Not explicitly stated in the rules, but potential loss conditions could include:\n  - Running out of time (if implemented).\n  - Failing to remove all boxes within a limited number of moves.\n  - Boxes becoming stuck in unreachable positions due to poor planning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy**\nTo successfully complete the level, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Layout**:\n   - The level consists of walls (`w`), the avatar (`A`), boxes (`1`), and holes (`0`).\n   - Identify the starting position of the avatar, the locations of the boxes, and the positions of the holes.\n\n2. **Plan Movements**:\n   - Determine the shortest path for each box to reach a hole.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n3. **Prioritize Box Removal**:\n   - Focus on pushing one box at a time toward its nearest hole.\n   - Be mindful of how pushing one box might affect the position of others.\n\n4. **Use Undo Mechanic Wisely**:\n   - If you accidentally push two boxes together near a wall, use the `undoAll` mechanic to reset their positions.\n\n5. **Test and Adjust**:\n   - Experiment with different sequences of moves if a plan fails.\n   - Keep track of your progress and adjust your strategy as needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Level-Specific Notes**\n- In this particular level:\n  - There are three boxes (`1`) and three holes (`0`).\n  - The avatar starts near the top-left corner (`A`).\n  - Plan a sequence of moves to guide each box into a hole without blocking access to other boxes or holes.\n\nBy combining careful observation, strategic planning, and efficient execution, you can successfully clear the level!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
