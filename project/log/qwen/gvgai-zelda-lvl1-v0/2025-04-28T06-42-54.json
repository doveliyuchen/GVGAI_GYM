The player navigates through a grid-based level, interacting with various objects (keys, enemies, doors) and using a sword to defeat monsters. The focus is on exploration, combat, and solving puzzles to reach the goal.\n\n---\n\n#### **Mechanics**\n1. **Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move in a grid-based environment.\n2. **Combat**: The avatar has a sword (`stype=sword`) that can be used to attack enemies. Enemies include bats (`monsterQuick`), spiders (`monsterNormal`), and scorpions (`monsterSlow`), each with different movement cooldowns.\n3. **Key Collection**: The player must collect a key to unlock the green door (`goal`). Collecting the key transforms the player from `nokey` to `withkey`.\n4. **Win/Loss Conditions**:\n   - Win: Reach the green door (`goal`) while holding the key (`withkey`).\n   - Loss: The player's avatar is destroyed (e.g., killed by an enemy).\n\n---\n\n#### **Objective**\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, collect the key, avoid or defeat enemies, and reach the green door. Along the way, the player can earn points by defeating enemies or collecting items.\n\n---\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win**: Achieve the condition where the player (`withkey`) interacts with the green door (`goal`).\n- **Loss**: The player's avatar is destroyed by an enemy or falls into a trap.\n\n---\n\n#### **Level Layout Analysis**\nThe level is represented as a 9x13 grid:\n- `w`: Walls that block movement.\n- `.`: Open floor tiles.\n- `+`: Likely the player's starting position (`A`).\n- `g`: Green door (`goal`).\n- `1`, `2`, `3`: Possible enemy spawn points for `monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, and `monsterSlow`, respectively.\n- `A`: Avatar's starting position.\n\nKey Observations:\n- The player starts near the left side of the level, surrounded by walls.\n- The key (`k`) is not explicitly shown in the layout, but it must exist somewhere in the open floor area.\n- Enemies are likely to spawn at positions `1`, `2`, and `3`, with varying speeds and patterns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Suggested Strategy**\nTo succeed in this game, the player should adopt the following strategy:\n\n1. **Locate the Key**:\n   - Explore the open areas systematically to find the key. Prioritize areas closer to the starting position to minimize encounters with enemies.\n   - Once the key is found, the player transforms into `withkey`, allowing interaction with the green door.\n\n2. **Avoid Enemies**:\n   - Use the walls and obstacles to block enemy paths. Since enemies have limited movement patterns (`RandomNPC` with cooldowns), the player can predict their movements and evade them.\n   - If necessary, use the sword to eliminate enemies. However, prioritize avoidance to conserve health and score.\n\n3. **Approach the Goal**:\n   - Once the key is collected, head directly toward the green door. Be cautious of any remaining enemies along the path.\n\n4. **Combat Tactics**:\n   - Focus on defeating weaker enemies (`monsterQuick`) first, as they pose less threat and provide more points when defeated.\n   - Avoid engaging multiple enemies simultaneously unless absolutely necessary.\n\n5. **Maximize Score**:\n   - Defeat enemies to increase the score. Each enemy killed awards 2 points, while reaching the goal awards 1 point.\n   - Collect the key for an additional point.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary**\nThis game combines elements of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. Success requires careful planning, efficient movement, and strategic use of the sword. By prioritizing key collection, avoiding unnecessary combat, and navigating efficiently, the player can achieve victory while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'k'\nkey monsterQuick -> 'm'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw...@w......w\nw..www......w\nw...........w\nw$&*....wwwww\nw.......wm..w\nw...w...w...w\nw...w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...$...w\nw...&...w\nw...*.w.w\nwww...w@w\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw.......w\nw.www...w\nw..mw...w\nw...w...w\nw...w...w\nwwwwwwwww",

    "content": "### Analysis of the Current State\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar (`*`) is located at `(4, 3)` in the rotated state.\n2. **Key Position**: The key (`#`) is not visible in the current state. It must be searched for in open areas.\n3. **Goal Position**: The goal (`@`) is located at `(8, 4)` in the rotated state.\n4. **Enemy Positions**:\n   - A `monsterSlow` (`&`) is at `(2, 3)`.\n   - A `monsterNormal` (`$`) is at `(1, 3)`.\n   - A `monsterQuick` (`%`) with a key (`m`) is at `(9, 5)`.\n\n### Strategy Application\n- The immediate priority is to avoid enemies and search for the key (`#`). Since the key's position is unknown, exploration is necessary.\n- Moving downward (`ACTION_DOWN`) will take the avatar closer to unexplored areas while avoiding the monsters positioned directly above.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` \nAction:5\n```\nFeedback: Moving upward should help the avatar explore new areas and potentially locate the key. This action aligns with the strategy of systematic exploration while avoiding direct confrontation with nearby enemies.",
