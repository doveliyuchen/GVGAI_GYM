The player controls an avatar that navigates through a grid-based level filled with walls, enemies, keys, and a goal door. The gameplay involves collecting items, defeating enemies, and solving puzzles to progress.\n\n---\n\n#### **Mechanics**\n1. **Movement**: The player's avatar (represented as `nokey` or `withkey`) can move around the level. Movement is blocked by walls (`wall`) and impassable objects.\n2. **Key Collection**: The player must collect a key (`key`) to unlock the green door (`goal`). Once collected, the avatar transforms into `withkey`.\n3. **Combat**: The avatar wields a sword (`sword`) for attacking enemies. The sword has limited use (5 flickers) before needing to recharge.\n4. **Enemies**: There are three types of monsters:\n   - **Quick Monsters** (`monsterQuick`): Fast-moving enemies with low cooldown.\n   - **Normal Monsters** (`monsterNormal`): Balanced speed and cooldown.\n   - **Slow Monsters** (`monsterSlow`): Slow-moving but more durable enemies.\n   All enemies will step back if they collide with each other.\n5. **Interactions**:\n   - If the player touches a wall or the closed door without the key, they cannot pass (`stepBack`).\n   - If the player defeats an enemy with their sword, they gain points (`scoreChange=2`).\n   - If the player is defeated by an enemy, they lose points (`scoreChange=-1`).\n\n---\n\n#### **Objective**\nThe primary objective is to reach the green door (`goal`) while carrying the key (`withkey`). Successfully doing so results in a win condition (`SpriteCounter stype=goal win=True`). However, if the player's avatar is destroyed, the game ends in a loss (`SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False`).\n\n---\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win Condition**: The player reaches the green door (`goal`) after collecting the key (`withkey`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The player's avatar (`avatar`) is destroyed by enemies.\n\n---\n\n#### **Suggested Overall Strategy**\n1. **Locate the Key**:\n   - Your first priority is to find and collect the key (`key`). Without it, you cannot open the green door.\n   - Avoid unnecessary combat until you have secured the key.\n\n2. **Manage Sword Usage**:\n   - Use the sword (`sword`) strategically, as it has a limited number of uses (5 flickers). Save it for critical moments, such as dealing with slow or dangerous enemies.\n\n3. **Prioritize Enemy Threats**:\n   - Focus on eliminating quick enemies (`monsterQuick`) first, as they can overwhelm you quickly.\n   - Slow enemies (`monsterSlow`) may require more hits but are less likely to catch you.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks**:\n   - Stay away from walls and dead ends where enemies might corner you.\n   - Plan your path carefully to minimize encounters with multiple enemies at once.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path to the Goal**:\n   - After collecting the key, navigate directly to the green door (`goal`). Avoid distractions and conserve resources.\n\n6. **Maximize Score**:\n   - While survival is the main goal, defeating enemies will increase your score. Try to eliminate enemies when safe to do so.\n\n---\n\n#### **Level Layout Insights**\nThe provided level layout gives clues about the placement of important elements:\n- `'A'` likely represents the starting position of the avatar.\n- `'w'` indicates walls, forming barriers and obstacles.\n- `'1'`, `'2'`, and `'3'` could represent different types of enemies (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`).\n- `'g'` marks the location of the green door (`goal`).\n- The key (`key`) is not explicitly marked but is likely hidden somewhere accessible between the avatar's start position and the door.\n\nBy understanding these mechanics and planning accordingly, the player can maximize their chances of success in this challenging dungeon environment!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nEvaluation: GOOD \\Feedback: The agent's move progressed toward the key, which is essential for reaching the goal. Although the agent moved closer to the monsterSlow and potentially exposed itself to danger, this action aligns with the objective of acquiring the key. The move demonstrates strategic fit by prioritizing the key pickup despite the increased risk, resulting in no immediate negative reward from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nkey monsterNormal -> 'k'\nkey monsterQuick -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw....ww.*&..w\nw....w......w\nw.w%....wwwww\nwkw.........w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw....w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...k...w\nw..www..w\nw....%..w\nw.......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w.*w\nw..w.w.&w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> *\nrow=1, col=9 -> &\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> %\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> k\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n**key strategy: Move directly toward the key while managing risks from nearby monsters**  \n**Alert**: Without immediate threats from `monsterQuick`, proceed with caution near `monsterNormal` and `monsterSlow`.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **CURRENT CAPABILITY**:  \n   The avatar can interact with keys to transform into `withkey`, enabling progression through the goal. It can also use its sword to defeat enemies, though this must be done strategically due to limited uses and potential exposure to danger.\n\n2. **STRATEGIC CHOICE**:  \n   The key is critical for unlocking the goal, so all actions should prioritize reducing the distance to it. Accepting calculated risks near slower enemies (`monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`) is justified when progressing toward the key.\n\n3. **EXECUTION PRINCIPLE**:  \n   - Navigate directly toward areas where the key is likely located, even if it involves moving closer to slower enemies.  \n   - Use **Alert** only if `monsterQuick` poses an immediate threat; otherwise, focus on collecting the key first.  \n   - Ensure a clear path forward is available after collecting the key to avoid being cornered by multiple enemies.  \n\nThis strategy ensures the avatar remains aligned with its primary objective while effectively managing risks, prioritizing key acquisition over neutralizing non-immediate threats.",
