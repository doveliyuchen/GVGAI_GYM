The player controls an avatar navigating through a grid-based level filled with walls, enemies, keys, and goals. The objective involves solving puzzles (e.g., collecting keys) while defeating enemies and avoiding death.\n\n---\n\n#### **Mechanics**\n1. **Movement**: The player can move the avatar (`A`) around the level. Movement is blocked by walls (`w`) and other immovable objects.\n2. **Key Collection**: The player starts as `nokey`. If they collect a key (`3`), the avatar transforms into `withkey`, allowing access to the goal door (`g`).\n3. **Combat**: \n   - The avatar wields a sword (`sword`) that can attack enemies.\n   - Enemies include:\n     - `monsterQuick`: Fast-moving bats that attack frequently.\n     - `monsterNormal`: Medium-speed spiders.\n     - `monsterSlow`: Slow-moving scorpions.\n   - Hitting an enemy with the sword kills it and grants points (+2 score).\n   - Being hit by an enemy reduces the player's health or ends the game if the avatar is killed.\n4. **Goal Interaction**:\n   - Entering the goal (`g`) without a key results in failure (`stepBack`).\n   - Entering the goal with the key wins the game (`killSprite` and increases the score).\n\n---\n\n#### **Objective**\nThe primary goal is to:\n- Collect the key (`3`).\n- Navigate through the level while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n- Reach the green goal door (`g`) with the key.\n\n---\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win**: Successfully reach the goal door (`g`) while holding the key (`withkey`).\n- **Loss**: The avatar sprite (`A`) is destroyed (killed by an enemy).\n\n---\n\n#### **Level Layout Analysis**\nThe provided level layout consists of walls (`w`), empty spaces (`.`), the avatar (`A`), enemies (`2`), the key (`3`), and the goal door (`g`). Key observations:\n1. The avatar starts near the top-left corner (`w..3.ww....Aw`).\n2. The key (`3`) is placed close to the starting position.\n3. There are multiple enemies (`2`) scattered throughout the level, including near the goal door (`w...2w....wgw`).\n4. The goal door (`g`) is located at the bottom-right corner of the level.\n\n---\n\n#### **Suggested Strategy**\nTo succeed in this game, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Collect the Key First**:\n   - Move directly toward the key (`3`) since it is essential for opening the goal door (`g`).\n   - Avoid unnecessary combat until you have secured the key.\n\n2. **Plan Your Path**:\n   - After obtaining the key, assess the positions of enemies and obstacles between you and the goal door.\n   - Use the walls (`w`) strategically to block enemy movement or create safe zones.\n\n3. **Engage Enemies Carefully**:\n   - Use the sword (`sword`) to defeat enemies when necessary, prioritizing those blocking your path.\n   - Remember that killing enemies earns you points (+2 per enemy), but avoid taking unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Approach the Goal Door**:\n   - Once you have the key and cleared any enemies near the goal, proceed cautiously toward the door (`g`).\n   - Ensure no enemies are in range before entering the door to avoid being killed at the last moment.\n\n5. **Adapt Dynamically**:\n   - Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on enemy behavior and unexpected challenges during gameplay.\n\n---\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize your chances of successfully completing the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD \\Feedback: The action did not result in any progress toward the key, goal, or avoiding monsters. It also did not align with the objective of reaching the goal while collecting the key and avoiding danger, resulting in no reward from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw....ww*....w\nw....w.%....w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w......$..w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw...&w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...#...w\nw..www..w\nw.......w\nw&......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w..%*w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w$w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> *\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> %\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> $\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n**key strategy: Focus on moving directly toward and collecting the key as the immediate priority to enable progression** without **Alert**\n\n**monster strategy: Avoid monsters until after securing the key, using walls to strategically block or evade threats** with **Alert**\n\n**goal strategy: Ensure possession of the key before moving toward the goal to prevent failure upon interaction** without **Alert**",
