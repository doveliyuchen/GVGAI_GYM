The player controls an avatar (a rat) and must navigate through a level filled with obstacles, boxes, and hazards to reach the exit (cheese). The goal involves strategic movement and interaction with objects.\n\n---\n\n#### **Mechanics:**\n\n1. **Sprites Overview:**\n   - **Avatar (rat):** Controlled by the player, can move around the level.\n   - **Box:** A passive object that can be pushed or manipulated but cannot move on its own.\n   - **Wall:** An immovable barrier blocking paths.\n   - **Floor:** Invisible platform where the avatar and other sprites stand.\n   - **Exit (cheese):** The objective; reaching it wins the game.\n   - **Hole:** A hazard that kills the avatar if stepped into, reducing the score by 1.\n   - **Timeout:** The game ends after 1000 steps unless completed earlier.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - If the avatar tries to move into a wall, it will \"step back\" and remain in place.\n   - Boxes bounce forward when the avatar pushes them.\n   - Boxes cannot pass through walls or exits; attempting this undoes all actions since the last valid state.\n   - Falling into a hole kills the avatar, resulting in a penalty (-1 score).\n   - Reaching the exit with the avatar grants +1 score and ends the game as a win.\n   - Boxes falling into holes are removed from the level.\n\n---\n\n#### **Objective:**\nThe main goal is for the avatar to reach the exit (green cheese) while avoiding hazards like holes and ensuring no invalid interactions occur (e.g., pushing a box into a wall near the exit).\n\n---\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Conditions:**\n  - The avatar successfully reaches the exit (cheese).\n  - All exits are cleared (if multiple exist), though only one seems present here.\n\n- **Loss Conditions:**\n  - The avatar dies by stepping into a hole (score decreases by 1).\n  - The avatar is eliminated (sprite count reaches 0).\n  - The timeout limit of 1000 steps is reached without completing the level.\n\n---\n\n#### **Suggested Overall Strategy:**\n\n1. **Plan Movements Carefully:**\n   - Study the layout before making moves. Identify potential hazards (holes) and pathways leading to the exit.\n   - Avoid unnecessary movements that might lead to dead ends or traps.\n\n2. **Manage Box Placement:**\n   - Boxes can block your path or help you create bridges over holes. Use them strategically.\n   - Be cautious about pushing boxes into walls or near the exit, as this will reset the level.\n\n3. **Avoid Holes:**\n   - Memorize their positions (marked as `h` in the level layout) and plan routes accordingly.\n   - Never step directly onto a hole unless absolutely necessary (though doing so results in failure).\n\n4. **Prioritize Efficiency:**\n   - Since there's a step limit (1000), try to minimize wasted moves.\n   - Focus on creating clear paths toward the exit rather than experimenting aimlessly.\n\n5. **Test and Retry:**\n   - If stuck, consider undoing recent actions or restarting entirely. Each attempt provides insight into optimal strategies.\n\n6. **Final Push:**\n   - Once close to the exit, ensure no obstacles block your way. Double-check the surroundings to confirm safety before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n#### **Level Layout Breakdown:**\nHere\u2019s how the level looks based on the provided layout:\n```\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nwx..111...1.w\nw..1.1ww111.w\nw..11.11h1..w\nwhhh.1.1..11w\nwww.11.11.11w\nw.1.1.11.h1.w\nw.1.1.A.1.1.w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n```\n\n- **Key Elements:**\n  - `'x'` marks the starting position of the avatar.\n  - `'1'` represents boxes.\n  - `'h'` indicates holes.\n  - `'A'` shows the avatar's initial location.\n  - `'w'` denotes walls forming boundaries.\n\n- **Pathfinding Tips:**\n  - Start by moving upward and left to gather nearby boxes.\n  - Gradually work downward, using boxes to bridge gaps caused by holes.\n  - Aim for the bottom-right corner where the exit likely resides.\n\nBy combining careful planning with efficient use of boxes, players should be able to complete the level successfully!\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
