    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### **Game Analysis**  \n\n#### **Genre:**  \nThis is a **top-down action-puzzle game** with elements of **dungeon crawling** and **key-lock mechanics**.  \n\n#### **Mechanics:**  \n- **Movement & Combat:**  \n  - The **avatar** (player) can move and **shoot swords** (`stype=sword`) to defeat enemies.  \n  - Enemies move randomly with different speeds (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`).  \n  - If the avatar touches an enemy, they lose a point (`scoreChange=-1`).  \n\n- **Key & Door Puzzle:**  \n  - The player starts as `nokey` and must pick up a **key** (`key`) to become `withkey`.  \n  - Only `withkey` can open the **goal** (green door) to win.  \n\n- **Obstacles:**  \n  - **Walls** block movement (`stepBack`).  \n  - Some enemies may block each other (`enemy enemy > stepBack`).  \n\n#### **Objective:**  \n- **Reach the goal (green door) while holding the key.**  \n- **Defeat enemies** for extra points.  \n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win:** Open the goal door (all `goal` sprites are removed).  \n- **Lose:** The player dies (no `avatar` left).  \n\n#### **Possible Strategy:**  \n1. **Find the Key First** \u2013 Before engaging enemies, locate and grab the key to unlock the door.  \n2. **Avoid Unnecessary Combat** \u2013 Some enemies are fast (`monsterQuick`), so dodging may be better than fighting.  \n3. **Use Sword Wisely** \u2013 Swords have a limited range (`limit=5`), so time attacks carefully.  \n4. **Plan Movement Around Walls** \u2013 The level has narrow paths; avoid getting cornered by enemies.  \n\n#### **Level-Specific Notes (Based on Layout):**  \n- The **avatar (`A`)** starts at the bottom-left.  \n- The **goal (`g`)** is near the top-right.  \n- Enemies (`1`, `2`, `3`) are scattered around.  \n- The **key (`+`)** is in the bottom-right area.  \n- **Optimal Path:**  \n  - Move right \u2192 down to grab the key \u2192 backtrack carefully to avoid enemies \u2192 reach the goal.  \n\nThis game resembles a mix of **Bomberman** (movement + shooting) and **Zelda-style dungeon puzzles** (keys & doors). Strategic movement and combat efficiency are key to winning.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nkey sword -> 'k'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'm'\nsword withkey -> 's'\nsword -> 'b'\nwithkey -> 'c'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> &\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> c\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> %\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar (`c` or `withkey`) is at (5, 10). This means the player currently has the key and can open the goal door.\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal (`@`) is at (1, 4). This is the green door that needs to be opened to win.\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A slow monster (`&`) at (1, 1).\n   - A quick monster (`%`) at (6, 11).\n   - A normal monster (`$`) at (7, 5).\n4. **Walls**: The map is surrounded by walls (`w`), with some internal walls blocking paths.\n5. **Path to Goal**: From (5, 10), the player needs to move left and up to reach the goal at (1, 4). The path involves:\n   - Moving left to (5, 9), then up to (4, 9), but (4, 9) is a wall, so this path is blocked.\n   - Alternative path: Move up to (4, 10), but (4, 10) is a wall.\n   - Another option: Move left to (5, 9), then up to (4, 9) is blocked, so the player must find another route.\n   - The viable path seems to be: \n     - Move left to (5, 9), then up to (4, 9) is blocked, so move left to (5, 8), which is a wall.\n     - This suggests the player is currently stuck or needs to backtrack.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\n- The player already has the key (`withkey`), so the priority is to reach the goal while avoiding enemies.\n- The quick monster (`%`) at (6, 11) is nearby and could pose a threat if the player moves down or right.\n- The normal monster (`$`) at (7, 5) is further away but could intercept if the player moves down.\n\n### Action Choice:\nGiven the current position and walls, the player cannot move left or up directly due to walls. The only viable move is to move **right** to (5, 11) to reposition and then plan a path toward the goal. \n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove right to (5, 11) to avoid the nearby quick monster and reposition for a clearer path toward the goal. Expectation: The avatar will move right to (5, 11), away from the quick monster at (6, 11), and open up options for upward movement toward the goal.",
