Move right \u2192 collect key (avoid enemies).  \n2. Head upwards, using walls to block enemies.  \n3. Reach the green door to win.  \n\n### **Final Verdict:**  \nA **fast-paced dungeon escape game** blending **combat, puzzle-solving, and risk management**. Success depends on **efficient movement, enemy awareness, and resource conservation**.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterQuick -> 'k'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw...kw......w\nw..www......w\nw...........w\nw.......wwwww\nw.......w#..w\nw&.$w...w...w\nw..*w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw.&.....w\nw.......w\nw*$...w.w\nwww...wkw\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw.......w\nw.www...w\nw..#w...w\nw...w...w\nw...w...w\nwwwwwwwww",

    "content": "Based on the rotated state, here's the analysis and action:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar ('*') is at the left side, near the middle of the map.\n2. **Key Position**: The key ('#') is at the bottom-right corner.\n3. **Goal Position**: The goal ('k') is near the top-right, behind some walls.\n4. **Enemies**: \n   - A quick monster ('$') is close to the avatar.\n   - A slow monster ('&') is above the avatar.\n   - Another monster (likely normal) is near the key.\n\n**Strategy**: \n- First, avoid the quick monster ('$') since it's dangerous and moves frequently.\n- Move towards the key ('#') while avoiding enemies.\n- After getting the key, navigate towards the goal ('k').\n\n**Action**: \n``` Action:3 ``` \n(Move RIGHT to start heading towards the key while avoiding the quick monster to the left). \n\n**Feedback**: Moving right should create distance from the quick monster and start progressing towards the key, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing key collection while avoiding unnecessary combat.",
