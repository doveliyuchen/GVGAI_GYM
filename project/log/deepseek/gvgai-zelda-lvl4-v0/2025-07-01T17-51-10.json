It resembles classic dungeon crawlers or maze games where the player must navigate obstacles, defeat enemies, and retrieve keys to progress.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Mechanics:**  \n1. **Movement & Exploration:**  \n   - The **avatar** (player) moves through a maze-like level with **walls** (blocking paths) and **floors** (walkable areas).  \n   - Some objects (like **movable**) can be pushed, but walls block movement.  \n\n2. **Combat System:**  \n   - The player has a **sword** (limited to 5 uses) to kill enemies.  \n   - Enemies come in different speeds:  \n     - **monsterQuick** (fast, cooldown=2)  \n     - **monsterNormal** (medium, cooldown=4)  \n     - **monsterSlow** (slow, cooldown=8)  \n   - If an enemy touches the player, they lose a point (**scoreChange=-1**).  \n\n3. **Key & Door System:**  \n   - The player starts as **nokey** and must find an **orange key** to transform into **withkey**.  \n   - Only **withkey** can open the **green goal (door)** to win.  \n   - Touching the goal without the key pushes the player back (**stepBack**).  \n\n4. **Scoring & Win/Loss:**  \n   - **+1 point** for picking up a key.  \n   - **+2 points** for killing an enemy.  \n   - **-1 point** if an enemy touches the player.  \n   - **Win Condition:** Reach the **goal** (door) with the key.  \n   - **Lose Condition:** The player dies (if the game tracks health, but here it\u2019s unclear\u2014possibly just score-based).  \n\n---\n\n### **Level Layout Breakdown:**  \nThe level is a maze with:  \n- **Walls (`w`)** \u2013 Block movement.  \n- **Floors (`.`)** \u2013 Walkable paths.  \n- **Goal (`g`)** \u2013 Must reach with the key.  \n- **Key (`+`)** \u2013 Must collect to open the door.  \n- **Enemies (`1`, `2`)** \u2013 Different speeds (1=quick, 2=normal).  \n- **Avatar (`A`)** \u2013 Starting position.  \n\n---\n\n### **Suggested Strategy:**  \n1. **Prioritize the Key:**  \n   - Find and collect the **key** first to unlock the door.  \n   - Avoid unnecessary fights if low on sword uses.  \n\n2. **Enemy Management:**  \n   - Use the **sword sparingly** (only 5 uses).  \n   - **Fast enemies (1)** are dangerous\u2014kill them first.  \n   - **Slow enemies (2)** can be avoided if possible.  \n\n3. **Path Optimization:**  \n   - Plan a route that minimizes enemy encounters.  \n   - If possible, **push movable objects** to block enemies.  \n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks:**  \n   - Don\u2019t rush into enemy groups; losing points hurts progress.  \n   - If the sword runs out, rely on dodging.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**  \nThis is a **strategic action-puzzle game** where smart movement, resource management (sword uses), and key collection are crucial. The player must balance combat and exploration to reach the goal efficiently.  \n\nWould you like a deeper breakdown of enemy patterns or optimal pathfinding?\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\ngoal monsterQuick -> '*'\nkey monsterNormal -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> %\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> $\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> &\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> #\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The key ('#') is at (7,6) - just 2 steps to the right from my position.\n3. There's a normal-speed enemy ('$') at (7,3) - left of me, but not immediately threatening.\n4. The goal ('@') is at (1,10) - far away, so first priority is getting the key.\n5. There's another normal enemy at (5,5) and a quick enemy ('%') at (2,11) - both not in immediate path to key.\n\nStrategy:\n- First priority is to collect the key at (7,6) by moving right twice.\n- The path to the key is clear - no walls or enemies blocking.\n- After getting the key, I can plan the route to the goal.\n\nNext Action:\n``` Action:3 ``` \nMove RIGHT towards the key. Expect to move from (7,4) to (7,5), which is a floor tile ('.') and safe. This is the first step towards the key.",
