    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### **Game Analysis**  \n\n#### **Genre:**  \nThis is a **top-down action-puzzle game** with elements of **adventure and dungeon-crawling**. The player must navigate a maze, collect items, and defeat enemies to reach the goal.  \n\n#### **Mechanics:**  \n- **Movement & Combat:**  \n  - The **avatar** (player) can move around and **shoot swords** (`ShootAvatar` with `stype=sword`).  \n  - Swords disappear after hitting enemies or walls (`OrientedFlicker limit=5`).  \n- **Keys & Doors:**  \n  - The player starts as `nokey` and must pick up the **orange key** (`key`) to transform into `withkey`.  \n  - Only `withkey` can open the **green goal door** (`goal`).  \n- **Enemies:**  \n  - Three types of monsters with different speeds (`monsterQuick`, `monsterNormal`, `monsterSlow`).  \n  - Enemies move randomly (`RandomNPC`) and can hurt the player on contact (`avatar enemy > killSprite scoreChange=-1`).  \n  - The player can kill enemies with swords (`enemy sword > killSprite scoreChange=2`).  \n- **Obstacles:**  \n  - **Walls** block movement (`movable wall > stepBack`).  \n  - **Floors** are mostly hidden (`hidden=True`), possibly revealing traps or secrets.  \n\n#### **Objective:**  \n- **Find the key** \u2192 **Open the goal door** \u2192 **Escape the level**.  \n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win:** Reach the **goal** (`goal`) while holding the key (`withkey`).  \n- **Lose:** The player dies (no `avatar` left).  \n\n#### **Possible Strategy:**  \n1. **Key First:** Locate and collect the **key** before engaging enemies.  \n2. **Combat Carefully:**  \n   - Kill fast enemies (`monsterQuick`) first\u2014they\u2019re more dangerous.  \n   - Use swords wisely (limited shots).  \n3. **Avoid Unnecessary Fights:** Some enemies can be dodged.  \n4. **Pathfinding:** Memorize the maze layout to backtrack efficiently.  \n5. **Score Optimization:** Killing enemies gives points, but survival is more important.  \n\n### **Level-Specific Notes (Based on Layout):**  \n- The player (`A`) starts near a **sword pickup (`+`)** and must navigate past **spiders (`1`)** and **bats (`2`)**.  \n- The **goal (`g`)** is in the top-right corner\u2014likely requires backtracking.  \n- **Walls (`w`)** form a maze, so planning movement is key.  \n\n**Final Tip:** Play defensively\u2014focus on getting the key first, then fight only when necessary.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nnokey -> '&'\nwithkey -> '*'\nsword -> 'm'\nsword withkey -> 's'\ngoal monsterNormal -> 'b'\ngoal monsterQuick -> 'c'\nsword wall -> 'd'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> *\nrow=1, col=4 -> $\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> $\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> w\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> w\nrow=3, col=6 -> w\nrow=3, col=7 -> w\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> w\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> w\nrow=4, col=6 -> w\nrow=4, col=7 -> w\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> .\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> w\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> %\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "### Analysis of Current State:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar (`*`, meaning `withkey`) is at (row=1, col=3). This means the player already has the key and can now focus on reaching the goal (`@` at row=1, col=10).\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal is at (row=1, col=10), but there is a normal-speed enemy (`$`) at (row=1, col=9) blocking the path.\n3. **Enemies**: \n   - A normal-speed enemy (`$`) at (row=1, col=4) and (row=1, col=9).\n   - A quick enemy (`%`) at (row=7, col=11), which is far away and not an immediate threat.\n4. **Obstacles**: Walls (`w`) form a maze, but the path to the goal seems clear if the enemy at (row=1, col=9) is dealt with.\n5. **Strategy Alignment**: \n   - Since the player already has the key, the priority is to reach the goal while avoiding or defeating enemies.\n   - The enemy at (row=1, col=9) is directly blocking the path to the goal, so it must be killed or avoided.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- **Shoot Sword (ACTION_USE)**: The player can shoot a sword to kill the enemy at (row=1, col=9). However, the avatar is at (row=1, col=3), and the enemy is at (row=1, col=9), which is 6 tiles to the right. Swords have a limited range (`OrientedFlicker limit=5`), so the sword may not reach the enemy.\n- **Move Toward Goal**: The player can move right (ACTION_RIGHT) to approach the goal, but this risks colliding with the enemy at (row=1, col=4) first.\n- **Alternative Path**: The player could move down (ACTION_DOWN) to (row=2, col=3) and navigate around the enemy, but this may take longer and risk encountering other enemies.\n\n### Best Action:\nGiven the sword's limited range, the safest immediate action is to **move right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to get closer to the enemy at (row=1, col=4) and then kill it with a sword. This will clear the path to approach the goal. \n\n``` Action:3 ```  \nMove right to approach the enemy at (row=1, col=4) and prepare to kill it with a sword, aligning with the \"Combat Carefully\" strategy.",
