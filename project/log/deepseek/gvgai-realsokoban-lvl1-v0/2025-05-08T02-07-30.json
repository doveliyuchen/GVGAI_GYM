The key is careful movement and avoiding irreversible pushes.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To provide a meaningful action, I need to understand the current state of the game, including the avatar's position and the surrounding level layout (boxes, holes, walls, etc.). Since the level layout isn't provided in the current state, I'll assume a typical Sokoban-like scenario where the avatar needs to push boxes into holes.  \n\nGiven the rules:  \n- **Boxes (\\*)** must be pushed into **holes (o)** to turn them into **boxin** (scoring +1).  \n- Avoid pulling **boxin** out of holes (loses progress).  \n- Walls block movement, and bouncing tiles (\"bbox\") may alter movement.  \n\n### Suggested Action (if no obstacles):  \n``` Action:2 ```  \n*(Move RIGHT to approach the nearest box for pushing. If the avatar doesn't move, it may be rotating\u2014repeat the action to move.)*  \n\n**Feedback:** This action aligns with the strategy of moving toward boxes to push them into holes. If blocked by a wall or box, I'll adjust direction accordingly.  \n\n*(Note: A more precise action requires the current level layout or avatar position.)*",
