Mistakes can lead to deadlocks, so think before pushing!  \n\nWould you like a step-by-step solution for this specific level?\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To provide a meaningful action, I need to see the current game state (level layout and avatar position). Since that isn't provided in your message, I'll give a general approach based on the rules:\n\n1. **Locate the avatar (A)** and nearby boxes (1/0) and holes (DARKBLUE).  \n2. **Push boxes toward holes** while avoiding deadlocks (e.g., boxing yourself into a corner).  \n3. If stuck, **use walls to reposition** (e.g., bounce a box off a wall to redirect it).  \n\nWithout the specific level state, here\u2019s a hypothetical action:  \n``` Action:2 ```  \n(Assuming the avatar is near a box to the right\u2014this would push the box rightward if the path is clear, or rotate the avatar right if movement is blocked.)  \n\n**Feedback:** \"Attempting to push a box rightward; if blocked, I\u2019ll adjust to find an open path toward a hole.\"  \n\nTo give precise advice, please share the current game state (e.g., grid layout with avatar position).",
