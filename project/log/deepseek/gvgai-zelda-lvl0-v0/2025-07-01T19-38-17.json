Collisions between enemies or with walls cause them to rebound (`stepBack`).\n\n4. **Interactions**:\n   - `avatar + enemy` \u2192 Player dies (`killSprite`).  \n   - `sword + enemy` \u2192 Enemy killed (+2 points).  \n   - `withkey + goal` \u2192 Goal removed (+1 point, win condition).  \n   - `nokey + goal` \u2192 Rejected (`stepBack`).  \n   - `movable + wall` \u2192 Blocked (e.g., crates/boxes can't pass walls).\n\n#### **Objective**\n- **Primary Goal**: Collect the `key` and reach the `goal` to win.  \n- **Secondary Goal**: Kill enemies for points (optional but strategic).\n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions**\n- **Win**: Eliminate all `goal` sprites (by touching them as `withkey`).  \n- **Loss**: Player avatar dies (contact with enemy).  \n\n#### **Level Layout Breakdown**\n```\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nwA.......w..w   # A: Player start (nokey)\nw..w........w\nw...w...w.+ww   # +: Key (at row 3, column 9)\nwww.w2..wwwww   # 2: Enemy (e.g., monsterQuick)\nw.......w.g.w   # g: Goal (at row 5, column 9)\nw.2.........w   # 2: Another enemy\nw.....2.....w   # 2: Third enemy\nwwwwwwwwwwwww   # w: Walls\n```\n- **Challenges**:  \n  - Enemies (3\u00d7 `monsterQuick`) patrol near critical paths.  \n  - Narrow corridors near goal/key increase collision risk.  \n  - Key and goal are close but separated by walls.  \n\n---\n\n### **Suggested Strategy**\n1. **Prioritize Safety**:  \n   - Avoid enemies\u2014contact is lethal. Use walls as barriers.  \n   - Kill high-threat enemies (e.g., fast `monsterQuick`) first with swords if they block paths.  \n\n2. **Key Collection Path**:  \n   - Navigate top-right from start (A) to key (+):  \n     ```\n     Start (1,1) \u2192 Move right/down \u2192 Key (3,9)\n     ```  \n   - Use central open area to lure enemies away before grabbing key.  \n\n3. **Goal Approach**:  \n   - After getting key (becoming `withkey`), head down to goal (g) at (5,9).  \n   - Clear enemies near goal with swords to prevent ambushes.  \n\n4. **Combat Tips**:  \n   - Swords have short range (5 tiles). Shoot only when enemies are lined up.  \n   - Kills grant points (+2) but are optional\u2014retreat if overwhelmed.  \n\n5. **Win Condition**:  \n   - Touch the goal as `withkey` to win instantly.  \n\n**Key Insight**: Efficiency matters\u2014enemies move faster over time. Secure key early, then control enemy movements to create a safe path to the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nnokey -> '%'\nsword -> '&'\nwithkey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> .\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> w\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> w\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> w\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> w\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> *\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> .\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> $\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
