    "content": "=== Game Rules ===\nGame rules in natural language:\n### **Game Analysis**  \n\n#### **Genre:**  \nThis is a **puzzle game** with elements of **sokoban (box-pushing)** and **maze navigation**.  \n\n#### **Key Mechanics:**  \n- **Avatar (Player)**: Moves around the grid (\u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192).  \n- **Boxes**: Can be pushed by the avatar but block movement if stuck.  \n- **Walls**: Solid barriers; avatar cannot pass through.  \n- **Holes**: Deadly traps\u2014if the avatar steps in, they lose a point and respawn (or die).  \n- **Exit (Cheese)**: Goal\u2014reaching it gives +1 point and wins the level if all exits are cleared.  \n- **Portal (Hole)**: Some holes may teleport (if `portal=True` is active).  \n\n#### **Objective:**  \nPush boxes strategically to clear a path and reach the exit (cheese) while avoiding holes.  \n\n#### **Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win**: All exits are reached (no more left on the map).  \n- **Loss**:  \n  - Avatar dies (e.g., falls in a hole too many times).  \n  - Time runs out (1000 steps).  \n\n#### **Possible Strategy:**  \n1. **Avoid Holes**: Stepping into one costs a point\u2014plan paths carefully.  \n2. **Box Management**:  \n   - Boxes can block holes (if they fall in, they disappear).  \n   - Don\u2019t push boxes against walls in a way that traps you.  \n3. **Efficiency**: Since there\u2019s a step limit (1000), optimize moves.  \n4. **Exit Priority**: Focus on reaching the exit (cheese) first, then push boxes if needed.  \n\n#### **Level-Specific Notes (Based on Layout):**  \n- The avatar (`A`) starts near holes (`h`)\u2014move carefully!  \n- Some boxes (`1`) are near walls; pushing them incorrectly may block progress.  \n- The exit (`x`) is in the top-right\u2014navigate around obstacles to reach it.  \n\n### **Final Verdict:**  \nA **challenging sokoban-like puzzle** where planning moves ahead is crucial to avoid traps and reach the goal efficiently.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> @\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> @\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> a\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> @\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> @\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> @\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> @\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",

    "content": "### Analysis:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar (`a`) is at (2, 11).  \n2. **Exit Position**: The exit (`#`) is at (1, 11), directly above the avatar.  \n3. **Obstacles**:  \n   - There is a box (`@`) at (1, 10) to the left of the exit.  \n   - The avatar is surrounded by walls (`%`) to the right (2, 12) and below (3, 11 is a box, not directly blocking).  \n   - A hole (`$`) is at (2, 4), but it's not immediately relevant here.  \n\n### Goal:\nReach the exit (`#`) at (1, 11). Since it's directly above the avatar, the simplest path is to move **UP**.  \n\n### Potential Issues:\n- If the avatar doesn't move after the first `UP` action, it might need to rotate first (as per the mechanics notice).  \n- The box at (1, 10) is adjacent to the exit, but it doesn't block the path since the exit is at (1, 11).  \n\n### Action:\n``` Action:4 ```  \n(Attempt to move UP toward the exit; if the avatar doesn't move, repeat the action to confirm movement after rotation.)  \n\n**Feedback**: Expect the avatar to move up to (1, 11) and win the level by reaching the exit. If not, the next action will be `UP` again to ensure movement after rotation.",
