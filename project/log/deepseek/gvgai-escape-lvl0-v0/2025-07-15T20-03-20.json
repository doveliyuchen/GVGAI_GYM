Boxes pushed into holes disappear.  \n   - **Exit** (cheese): Reaching it removes the exit and scores (`scoreChange=1`).  \n\n3. **Win/Loss Triggers**  \n   - **Win**: All exits removed (avatar reaches the exit).  \n   - **Loss**: Avatar dies (by hole), or time runs out (1,000 steps).  \n\n---\n\n### Objective  \n**Guide the avatar (rat) to the exit (cheese)** while avoiding holes and strategically moving boxes to clear paths.  \n\n---\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions  \n- **\u2705 Win**: Exit is removed (avatar reaches it).  \n- **\u274c Loss**:  \n  - Avatar dies (stepping on a hole).  \n  - Time limit (1,000 steps) expires.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Strategy  \n1. **Avoid Holes at All Costs**  \n   - Holes instantly kill the avatar. Prioritize pathfinding around them.  \n   - Sacrifice boxes to fill holes *only* if it clears a critical path (boxes disappear, but holes remain dangerous for the avatar).  \n\n2. **Box Management**  \n   - Push boxes to **create clear paths** to the exit.  \n   - Avoid trapping boxes against walls/exits/other boxes (permanently blocks movement).  \n   - Use boxes to **block holes** if needed (prevents accidental stepping).  \n\n3. **Efficient Pathing**  \n   - Navigate the maze to bypass clusters of boxes/holes.  \n   - Example path (from level layout):  \n     - Start (avatar \"A\" at bottom-left).  \n     - Move upward, push the box at `(7,3)` right into the hole `(7,5)` to clear space.  \n     - Veer left/up around central walls, avoiding top-right hole `(2,4)`.  \n     - Reach exit `(1,11)` at top-right.  \n\n4. **Time Awareness**  \n   - Plan moves ahead; avoid unnecessary pushes to conserve steps (1,000-step limit).  \n\n---\n\n### Level-Specific Tips  \n- **Holes**: At `(2,4)`, `(4,1)`, and `(7,5)`. Use boxes to plug these if they obstruct the main path.  \n- **Boxes**: Clear the dense cluster near the start (row 7) first. Push boxes into holes or open areas.  \n- **Exit Path**: Navigate top-right via the open corridor (rows 1\u20132, columns 10\u201311), but avoid the hole at `(2,4)`.  \n\n> **Key Insight**: This is a **spatial puzzle**\u2014success depends on planning box movements 2-3 steps ahead to avoid deadlocks. Prioritize avatar safety over pushing boxes unless critical.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nexit floor -> 'x'\nhole floor -> 'h'\nbox floor -> '1'\nfloor -> '.'\nbox -> '@'\nexit -> '#'\nhole -> '$'\nwall -> '%'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> %\nrow=0, col=1 -> %\nrow=0, col=2 -> %\nrow=0, col=3 -> %\nrow=0, col=4 -> %\nrow=0, col=5 -> %\nrow=0, col=6 -> %\nrow=0, col=7 -> %\nrow=0, col=8 -> %\nrow=0, col=9 -> %\nrow=0, col=10 -> %\nrow=0, col=11 -> %\nrow=0, col=12 -> %\nrow=1, col=0 -> %\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> @\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> @\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> @\nrow=1, col=8 -> @\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> a\nrow=1, col=11 -> #\nrow=1, col=12 -> %\nrow=2, col=0 -> %\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> $\nrow=2, col=5 -> .\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> @\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> @\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> %\nrow=3, col=0 -> %\nrow=3, col=1 -> @\nrow=3, col=2 -> @\nrow=3, col=3 -> @\nrow=3, col=4 -> @\nrow=3, col=5 -> @\nrow=3, col=6 -> @\nrow=3, col=7 -> @\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> @\nrow=3, col=10 -> @\nrow=3, col=11 -> @\nrow=3, col=12 -> %\nrow=4, col=0 -> %\nrow=4, col=1 -> $\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> @\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> @\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> @\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> %\nrow=5, col=0 -> %\nrow=5, col=1 -> %\nrow=5, col=2 -> %\nrow=5, col=3 -> %\nrow=5, col=4 -> %\nrow=5, col=5 -> %\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> .\nrow=5, col=9 -> @\nrow=5, col=10 -> @\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> %\nrow=6, col=0 -> %\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> @\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> @\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> @\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> %\nrow=7, col=0 -> %\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> $\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> @\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> %\nrow=8, col=0 -> %\nrow=8, col=1 -> %\nrow=8, col=2 -> %\nrow=8, col=3 -> %\nrow=8, col=4 -> %\nrow=8, col=5 -> %\nrow=8, col=6 -> %\nrow=8, col=7 -> %\nrow=8, col=8 -> %\nrow=8, col=9 -> %\nrow=8, col=10 -> %\nrow=8, col=11 -> %\nrow=8, col=12 -> %",
