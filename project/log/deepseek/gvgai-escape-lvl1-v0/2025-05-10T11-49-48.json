Multiple holes (`h`) and boxes (`1`) are scattered.  \n- Likely solution: Push boxes to fill holes or create a safe path to the cheese (`x`).  \n- Watch for tight spaces where boxes might get stuck.  \n\n### **Verdict:**  \nA **Sokoban-inspired puzzle game** with added hazards (holes) and a scoring system. Strategy revolves around box-pushing, pathfinding, and risk management.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To provide a meaningful action, I need to see the current game state (level layout and avatar position). Since that information isn't provided in your message, I cannot determine the optimal move.  \n\nHowever, based on the general rules:  \n- If the avatar is next to a box, pushing it (`ACTION_LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN`) could help clear a path.  \n- If near the exit (`x`), move toward it to win.  \n- Avoid holes (`h`) at all costs.  \n\n**Example Response (if I could see the state):**  \n``` Action:2 ```  \n\"I\u2019m moving right to push a box toward a hole, expecting to clear a path to the cheese.\"  \n\nPlease share the current game state (e.g., grid layout with `A`, `1`, `h`, `x` positions) for a precise action!  \n\n*(Note: If the avatar didn\u2019t move after a prior action, repeat the same direction to confirm movement after rotation.)*",
