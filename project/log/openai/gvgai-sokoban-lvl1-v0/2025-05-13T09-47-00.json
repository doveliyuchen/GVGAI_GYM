The mechanics suggest elements of strategy and problem-solving, akin to classic puzzle games like Sokoban.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites**: Various types of sprites are defined, each with specific properties:\n  - **Immovable Sprites**: Walls, floors, and holes that define the boundaries of the playfield.\n  - **MovingAvatar**: A player-controlled character (the 'avatar') that can move within the environment.\n  - **Passive Boxes**: Objects that can be influenced by the avatar but are not directly controlled.\n  \n- **Interactions**:\n  - The avatar cannot move through walls, as it will step back upon colliding.\n  - The avatar can push boxes, which will bounce back when moved.\n  - Boxes can be placed into holes, which results in the box being removed from the playfield, earning the player a score.\n  - Two boxes colliding with walls will undo their movement, preventing further progress unless managed properly.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to eliminate all boxes from the playfield by pushing them into the holes. The game concludes successfully when there are no boxes left (SpriteCounter for boxes hits 0), resulting in a win condition.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: All boxes must be removed from the playfield (SpriteCounter for boxes reaches 0).\n- **Loss Condition**: While there is no explicit loss condition outlined in the provided rules, strategic mismanagement of box placements might lead players to a scenario where they cannot push boxes effectively, potentially stalling progress.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Plan Moves in Advance**: Before moving the avatar, analyze the layout to determine the best path to push boxes into holes. Consider the placement of walls and holes relative to the starting positions of the boxes.\n\n2. **Prioritize Box Removal**: Focus on moving boxes into holes rather than just pushing them around. Each box pushed into a hole increases your score and is necessary for achieving a win condition.\n\n3. **Avoid Trapping Boxes**: Be cautious not to push boxes into positions where they become unable to be moved further (e.g., cornering them between walls). Always keep an exit route available.\n\n4. **Utilize Bouncing Effectively**: When pushing boxes, take advantage of the bounce mechanic to reposition boxes strategically before moving them again to more advantageous locations.\n\n5. **Use Walls Wisely**: Walls can be both an obstacle and a strategic tool. Use them to redirect box movements and manage space efficiently.\n\nBy following these strategies and understanding the mechanics of the game, players can effectively navigate through the levels and work towards achieving the win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
