Points are gained by successfully reaching the exit and lost when interacting with holes.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when the player has reached the exit with the avatar, as indicated by the exit sprite being removed from the game.\n- **Loss Conditions:** The game is lost when the avatar is removed (SpriteCounter limit reached), or the time runs out (timeout limit).\n\n### Overall Strategy:\n\n1. **Map Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Identify where the exit is and the locations of the holes and walls. \n\n2. **Box Management:** Use the boxes strategically. Consider pushing boxes to either block holes or create pathways. Avoid positions where boxes can be trapped or stacked in a manner that prevents further actions.\n\n3. **Hazard Avoidance:** Always be cautious when moving toward holes. Make sure there\u2019s a plan to either navigate around them or use boxes to block them.\n\n4. **Timed Moves:** Keep an eye on the time limit. Don\u2019t rush, but make sure you have a plan that can be executed within the time constraints to avoid losing.\n\n5. **Trial and Error:** Many puzzle games require experimentation. If something doesn\u2019t work right away, don\u2019t hesitate to reset and try a different approach.\n\nBy following these strategies and being adaptive to the challenges presented by the level, players can maximize their chances of successfully reaching the exit and winning the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "### Current State Analysis\nIn the current state, the avatar ('a') is located at `(5, 3)`. Analyzing the surrounding entities:\n\n- Up `(4, 3)`: Box ('@')\n- Down `(6, 3)`: Floor ('.')\n- Left `(5, 2)`: Floor ('.')\n- Right `(5, 4)`: (previous position \u2014 this is where I just moved from)\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n1. The avatar can push the box above at `(4, 3)` if I move up, which would affect future movement options.\n2. Moving down to `(6, 3)` or left to `(5, 2)` both offer clear floor spaces without immediate hazards.\n3. Moving left to `(5, 2)` is preferable as it opens up more pathways horizontally without interfacing with the box and provides the potential for further movements around a box.\n\n### Decision Making\nSince my last position was `(5, 4)` and I just moved left to `(5, 3)`, I'm still in a position to maneuver. Moving further to the left seems to be the best option for exploration.\n\nI will choose to move **left**:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis allows me to explore more space on the left, creating opportunities for future moves while keeping options open for dealing with the boxes and avoiding hazards.",
