It involves exploration, combat, and item collection, which are common elements in these genres.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can shoot and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Enemies**: Different types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that can harm the player.\n   - **Key and Goal**: The player must collect a key to unlock a door (goal) to win.\n   - **Walls and Floors**: Obstacles that define the playable area.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can interact with enemies using a sword, gaining points for defeating them.\n   - The avatar can collect a key, which transforms its state from \"nokey\" to \"withkey,\" allowing access to the goal.\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls or the goal without the key.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal with the key.\n   - The game is lost if the avatar is defeated by an enemy.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect the key and reach the goal (door) to win. The player must navigate through the level, avoid or defeat enemies, and solve the challenge of obtaining the key.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite while in the \"withkey\" state.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify where the key and enemies are located. The level has walls that create a maze-like structure, so understanding the paths is crucial.\n\n2. **Collect the Key**: Prioritize finding the key. The avatar must transform from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\" to access the goal. Look for the key's location and plan a route to reach it while avoiding enemies.\n\n3. **Combat Strategy**: \n   - Engage enemies strategically. Use the sword to defeat them for points, but be cautious of their attack patterns.\n   - Avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies if you can navigate around them safely.\n\n4. **Movement and Positioning**: \n   - Use the walls to your advantage. If you encounter a quick enemy, try to maneuver around walls to create distance.\n   - Be aware of the cooldowns of the enemies; some are faster than others, so plan your movements accordingly.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route**: Once you have the key, plan the most efficient route to the goal. Avoid backtracking and ensure you have a clear path to the door.\n\n6. **Health Management**: Keep an eye on your health (if applicable) and avoid taking unnecessary damage from enemies. If you are low on health, consider retreating to a safe area to regroup.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, defeat enemies, collect the key, and ultimately reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'm'\nkey monsterQuick -> 'n'\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw&..@w.$....w\nw..www......w\nw...........w\nw.......wwwww\nw.......w#..w\nw..%w...w...w\nw..*w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw......&w\nw.......w\nw*%...w.w\nwww...w@w\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw......$w\nw.www...w\nw..#w...w\nw...w...w\nw...w...w\nwwwwwwwww",

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, let's break down the relevant elements:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is currently at the position marked by `*` in the original state, which is located at (6, 3) in a grid format.\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal is located at (1, 5) marked by `@`.\n3. **Key Position**: The key is located at (6, 7) marked by `#`.\n4. **Enemies**: There are two enemies present:\n   - A slow monster (`&`) at (1, 5).\n   - A quick monster (`%`) at (6, 4).\n\n### Current Situation\n- The avatar is in the \"nokey\" state and needs to collect the key to transform into the \"withkey\" state.\n- The avatar is surrounded by walls and has two enemies nearby, which could pose a threat if approached carelessly.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the current state, the immediate goal is to collect the key (`#`) located at (6, 7). The avatar can move right to (6, 4) where the quick monster (`%`) is located, but this could lead to a confrontation. \n\n### Action Decision\nThe best course of action is to move right to (6, 4) to engage the quick monster. If the avatar can defeat the monster, it can then proceed to collect the key. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, allowing for a potential engagement with the quick monster. I expect this aligns with the strategy of defeating enemies to progress towards collecting the key.",
