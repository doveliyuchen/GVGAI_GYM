It involves exploration, item collection, and combat mechanics.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** The base on which the player and other sprites move.\n   - **Goal:** A green door that the player must reach to win, but only if they have a key.\n   - **Key:** An item that allows the player to unlock the goal.\n   - **Sword:** A weapon used to defeat enemies.\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character, which can shoot and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Enemies:** Various types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that the player must avoid or defeat.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that shape the level layout.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player can interact with the goal only if they possess the key.\n   - Enemies can be defeated using the sword, but the player loses points if they are hit by an enemy.\n   - Collecting the key transforms the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey,\" indicating that the player has acquired the key.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions:**\n   - The game ends in victory when the player reaches the goal with the key.\n   - The game ends in defeat if the avatar is defeated (i.e., loses all lives).\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to collect the key and reach the goal (the green door) to win the game. The player must navigate through the level, avoiding or defeating enemies while managing their health.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** Reach the goal with the key.\n- **Loss Condition:** The avatar is defeated by enemies.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Identify where the key and goal are located, as well as the positions of enemies.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Prioritize finding and collecting the key. This will allow you to access the goal and win the game.\n\n3. **Manage Combat:**\n   - Use the sword to defeat enemies when necessary, but be cautious of your health. Avoid unnecessary confrontations, especially with stronger enemies.\n\n4. **Avoid Damage:**\n   - Keep an eye on enemy movements and patterns. Use the environment (walls and floors) to your advantage to dodge attacks.\n\n5. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - Once you have the key, plan a route to the goal that minimizes encounters with enemies. If possible, take a path that allows you to avoid combat.\n\n6. **Stay Aware of Health:**\n   - Monitor your health closely. If you are low on health, consider retreating to a safer area to regroup before engaging enemies.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively navigate the game, collect necessary items, and achieve victory while minimizing the risk of defeat.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\ngoal monsterSlow -> 'k'\nmonsterNormal monsterSlow -> 'm'\ngoal monsterQuick -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw...@w......w\nw..www......w\nw...........w\nw.......wwwww\nw.......w#..w\nw&.%w...w...w\nw$.*w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw$&.....w\nw.......w\nw*%...w.w\nwww...w@w\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw.......w\nw.www...w\nw..#w...w\nw...w...w\nw...w...w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> .\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> .\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> &\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> %\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> $\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

    "content": "To analyze the current state, I see that my avatar (represented as '*') is located at (row 7, col 3). The key (represented as '#') is located at (row 5, col 9), and the goal (represented as '@') is at (row 1, col 4). There are also enemies present: a monsterSlow ('&') at (row 6, col 1) and a monsterQuick ('%') at (row 6, col 3).\n\nGiven the strategy, my immediate goal is to collect the key to transform my avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey,\" which will allow me to access the goal. The key is two rows above my current position, and I need to navigate through the level while avoiding enemies.\n\nSince I am currently at (7, 3), I can move up to (6, 3) where the monsterQuick is located. However, I need to avoid this enemy to prevent losing health. The best course of action is to move left to (7, 2), which is a safe floor tile.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows me to reposition safely and avoid the enemy while planning my next move towards the key. I expect to continue navigating towards the key without encountering any immediate threats.",
