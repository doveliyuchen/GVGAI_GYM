It features character movement, combat, and item collection.\n\n**Mechanics:**  \n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar:** The main player character that can shoot and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Goal:** A door that the player must reach to win, but only when holding a key.\n   - **Key:** A collectible needed to unlock the goal.\n   - **Monsters/Enemies:** Various types that can harm the player (or be defeated for points).\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that the avatar must navigate around.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player can move and interact with different objects including keys, goals, and enemies.\n   - If the player has the key, they can unlock the goal and win the game.\n   - If the player encounters enemies without a weapon, they suffer a point penalty.\n   - Collecting a key transforms the sprite from \u2018nokey\u2019 to \u2018withkey\u2019, indicating that the player has acquired the key.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe main objective is to navigate through the level to collect the key and reach the goal (the green door). Players must avoid or defeat enemies, and use the key to unlock the goal for victory.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal while holding the key.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy (indicated by a score change of -1), or if the avatar is unable to progress through the level (such as being unable to collect the key or reach the goal).\n\n### Strategy Suggestions\n\n1. **Explore the Level:** Take your time to explore the entire layout. Identify locations of keys and enemies while ensuring you know the safest paths.\n\n2. **Prioritize Collecting the Key:** The key is essential to unlocking the goal. Identify the \u2018nokey\u2019 sprite in your vicinity and prioritize defeating any enemies that may block your path to it.\n\n3. **Use Combat Wisely:** When you encounter enemies, make sure to engage them if you are equipped with a sword. However, avoid unnecessary confrontations that might lead to being defeated.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path:** Before moving toward the goal, ensure that you have the key. Plan your movements around walls and enemies to avoid getting trapped or losing health.\n\n5. **Stay Aware of Enemy Types:** Different enemies have different cooldowns and behaviors. Adapt your strategy based on the enemy type you encounter:\n   - **Quick Monsters:** Engage quickly to avoid getting overwhelmed.\n   - **Normal Monsters:** Take a calculated approach; they are easier to deal with but may still pose a threat.\n   - **Slow Monsters:** Use them to your advantage\u2014since they are slower, you can evade or attack them more easily.\n\n6. **Be Cautious Near Walls:** Keep an eye out for any movable walls. These can change the layout of the level and affect your movement and strategy.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can improve their chances of successfully navigating the game, collecting necessary items, and ultimately reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nkey monsterQuick -> 'm'\nsword -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw...@w......w\nw..www......w\nw.........$.w\nw.......wwwww\nw......&w#..w\nw...w...w...w\nw.%*w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw.......w\nw%......w\nw*....w.w\nwww...w@w\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw..&....w\nw.www...w\nw..#w...w\nw...w$..w\nw...w...w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> @\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> .\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> w\nrow=2, col=4 -> w\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> .\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> .\nrow=3, col=9 -> .\nrow=3, col=10 -> $\nrow=3, col=11 -> .\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> .\nrow=4, col=2 -> .\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> w\nrow=4, col=9 -> w\nrow=4, col=10 -> w\nrow=4, col=11 -> w\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> .\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> .\nrow=5, col=6 -> .\nrow=5, col=7 -> &\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> #\nrow=5, col=10 -> .\nrow=5, col=11 -> .\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> w\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> %\nrow=7, col=3 -> *\nrow=7, col=4 -> w\nrow=7, col=5 -> .\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> .\nrow=7, col=11 -> .\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
