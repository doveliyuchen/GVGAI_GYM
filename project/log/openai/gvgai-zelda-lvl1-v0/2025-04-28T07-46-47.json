It involves exploration, combat, and item collection, which are common elements in these genres.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character, which can shoot and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Enemies**: Different types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that can harm the player.\n   - **Key and Goal**: The player must collect a key to unlock a goal (door) to win.\n   - **Walls and Floors**: Obstacles that define the level layout.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The player can interact with the goal only if they have the key.\n   - The player can defeat enemies using the sword, gaining points.\n   - The player can transform from a \"nokey\" state to a \"withkey\" state upon collecting the key.\n   - The player can step back when colliding with walls or when trying to access the goal without the key.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends in victory when the player reaches the goal with the key.\n   - The game ends in defeat if the avatar is defeated (score changes negatively).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect the key and reach the goal (door) to win. The player must navigate through the level, avoid or defeat enemies, and manage their interactions with the environment.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal sprite while in the \"withkey\" state.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify where the key and goal are located. The level has walls that may block paths, so plan your route accordingly.\n\n2. **Collect the Key**: Prioritize finding the key (transforming from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\") as it is essential for accessing the goal.\n\n3. **Combat Strategy**: \n   - Use the sword to defeat enemies for points and to clear paths.\n   - Be cautious of enemy types; quick monsters may require faster reflexes, while slow monsters may be easier to avoid or defeat.\n\n4. **Avoiding Damage**: \n   - Try to avoid direct contact with enemies to prevent losing points and potentially losing the game.\n   - Use the environment (walls) to your advantage to create distance from enemies.\n\n5. **Plan Your Moves**: Since some interactions cause the player to step back, be mindful of your positioning when approaching the goal or engaging enemies.\n\n6. **Score Management**: While defeating enemies is beneficial for points, focus on the primary objective of reaching the goal with the key to win the game.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game, defeat enemies, and ultimately achieve victory by reaching the goal.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "
