It involves exploration, item collection, and combat against enemies.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Floor:** The basic ground where the avatar can move.\n   - **Goal:** A green door that serves as the exit or objective.\n   - **Key:** An orange item that allows access to the goal.\n   - **Sword:** A weapon used by the avatar to defeat enemies.\n   - **Avatar:** The player's character, which can shoot and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Enemies:** Various types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that the avatar must avoid or defeat.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that define the level layout.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The avatar can interact with the key to transform into a version that can access the goal.\n   - The avatar can defeat enemies using the sword, gaining points.\n   - The avatar cannot pass through walls or reach the goal without the key.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal (green door) by collecting the key (orange) and defeating enemies. The player must navigate through the level, avoiding or defeating enemies while ensuring they collect the key to unlock the goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal with the key.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify where the key and enemies are located.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Prioritize finding the key as it is essential to access the goal. Be cautious of enemies while doing so.\n\n3. **Combat Strategy:**\n   - Use the sword to defeat enemies when necessary. Focus on quick enemies first, as they can be more challenging to avoid.\n   - Maintain distance from enemies when possible to avoid losing health.\n\n4. **Plan Your Route:**\n   - After collecting the key, plan a route to the goal that minimizes encounters with enemies. Use walls and obstacles to your advantage to avoid direct confrontations.\n\n5. **Manage Health:**\n   - Keep track of your health and avoid unnecessary risks. If you are low on health, consider retreating or avoiding combat until you can recover.\n\n6. **Utilize Power-Ups:**\n   - If there are any power-ups or health items available, make sure to collect them to enhance your chances of survival.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively navigate the level, defeat enemies, and ultimately reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw.&.@w....%.w\nw..www......w\nw..........$w\nw.......wwwww\nw.......w#..w\nw...w...w...w\nw*..w.......w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw*......w\nw......&w\nw.....w.w\nwww...w@w\nw.....www\nw.......w\nw.......w\nw.www...w\nw..#w...w\nw...w..%w\nw...w$..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.",
