The player must solve spatial challenges involving the placement and movement of objects within a confined environment.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n1. **Sprites**: There are different types of sprites (game objects) in the game, including:\n   - **Fixed Elements**: 'floor', 'ground', 'wall' (cannot be moved).\n   - **Movable Elements**: 'avatar' (the player\u2019s character), 'box' (can be pushed), and 'bbox' (acts as a bouncing object).\n   - **Transforming Elements**: 'box' can change into 'boxin' when placed in a 'hole', affecting the score.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can step back when encountering a wall.\n   - The 'bbox' bounces back when it hits the avatar, potentially affecting movement.\n   - Boxes can interact with holes to gain points and transform back to their original state when placed on the ground.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary objective of the game is to successfully transform all the 'box' sprites into 'boxin' by placing them into the 'hole', thus earning enough points. The game is won when the total count of 'box' sprites reaches zero.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions:\n- **Win Condition**: The game is won when all the 'box' sprites are transformed into 'boxin', which is achieved by successfully placing them in the hole.\n- **Loss Condition**: While the rules do not explicitly state a loss condition, players may become stuck or unable to progress if they cannot effectively navigate obstacles (walls, immovable sprites) or manage the bouncing interactions.\n\n### Suggested Overall Strategy:\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: Since the game involves spatial reasoning, carefully plan the movements of the avatar and boxes. Determine the best order to push the boxes towards the hole without getting trapped by walls or other obstacles.\n  \n2. **Utilize Bouncing**: Take advantage of bouncing mechanics to reposition boxes strategically, understanding how they interact with the avatar.\n\n3. **Manage Transformations**: Be mindful when placing boxes in holes. Transforming boxes into 'boxin' decreases the box count, so prioritize which boxes to convert to maximize score.\n\n4. **Navigate Wisely**: Use the walls to your advantage to guide the avatar around the level and avoid unnecessary bouncing or misplacement of boxes.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**: Since puzzle games often require experimentation, don\u2019t hesitate to try different approaches to see how your moves affect the game state. Sometimes a strategy may not work initially but can lead to new insights.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can improve their chances of successfully completing the level and achieving a win condition.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_LEFT\n2: ACTION_RIGHT\n3: ACTION_DOWN\n4: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. "

    "content": "To make an informed decision, I need to understand the current state of the game, including the avatar's position and the surrounding elements (walls, boxes, holes, etc.). Since I cannot see the current game state, I will assume a general scenario based on the provided rules and strategies.\n\nIf the avatar is positioned next to a wall, I would expect to step back as per the interaction rules. If there are boxes nearby that I can interact with, I would need to prioritize moving them toward the hole. If my position remains unchanged from the last action, I would re-evaluate my surroundings and consider different actions that would allow for progress.\n\nGiven that I might not know the exact state but need to follow my strategy, I will choose a simple action of moving in a direction that may allow me to interact with a box if one is nearby.\n\nLet's assume that I am positioned with the option to push a box to the right. I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action aims to move the avatar to the right, which aligns with the strategy to push boxes toward holes and manage the game state effectively. I expect that this action will either interact with a box or allow me further movement options if there are no immediate obstacles.",
