Each sprite has specific properties and interactions. \n- **Avatar Control:** The player controls an avatar that can shoot a sword to interact with enemies and blocks.\n- **Movement:** The avatar can navigate through the game environment, but interactions with certain sprites (like walls and goals) can alter the player's movement.\n- **Collecting Keys:** The player can collect keys to unlock goals that allow them to progress or score points.\n- **Combat:** The player can defeat enemies using their sword, which results in positive score changes, but the avatar can also be harmed by enemies, resulting in a negative score.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal (the green door) after obtaining the key (orange) to unlock it. By defeating enemies and successfully navigating obstacles, players aim to accumulate points.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**  \n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal sprite while holding the key, which results in a score increment.\n- **Loss Condition:** If the player avatar is defeated by an enemy, the game ends in loss, represented by a negative score.\n\n### Suggested Strategy:\n\n1. **Explore Thoroughly:** Carefully explore the level layout to familiarize yourself with the positions of walls, enemies, and the key. Knowing the layout helps you plan your moves.\n\n2. **Prioritize Key Collection:** Focus on collecting the key first, as obtaining it transforms your avatar (from 'nokey' to 'withkey'), enabling you to access the goal.\n\n3. **Engage Enemies Wisely:** Use the sword effectively to defeat enemies for extra points. However, keep an eye on your health and position to avoid unnecessary damage.\n\n4. **Plan Your Path:** Before moving, strategize your route. Be cautious of the fixed paths created by the walls and think ahead about possible enemy encounters.\n\n5. **Use Movement to Your Advantage:** If you encounter a movable wall, understand that you may need to step back and change your approach to navigate around obstacles.\n\n6. **Score Management:** Always be mindful of your score. Avoid confrontations that could lead to loss of points unless necessary for progression.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can optimize their chances of successfully reaching the goal while maximizing their score.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**nokey strategy: Immediately pursue the key to transform to 'withkey', enabling access to the goal** without **Alert**  \n**key strategy: Collect the nearby key to facilitate interaction with the goal and enable scoring opportunities** without **Alert**  \n**enemy strategy: Maintain a safe distance from the monsterNormal to minimize capture risk and avoid vulnerability** with **Alert**  \n**sword strategy: Use the sword defensively, engaging with enemies only when there is a safe opportunity** with **Alert**  \n**goal strategy: Once the key is obtained, prioritize moving towards the goal to achieve victory** without **Alert**  \nEvaluation: BAD \nFeedback: The action taken, classified as \"4,\" did not facilitate any progress toward winning the game. The avatar remains dangerously close to a monsterNormal, significantly increasing the risk of capture. This action does not help the agent advance toward critical objectives, such as obtaining the key or reaching the goal. Instead, it keeps the avatar in a vulnerable position without any strategic advantages. The reward of 0.0 indicates that this action was ineffective and did not positively impact the agent's overall progress in the game.\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw...&ww.....w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w.........w\nw.w.$wwwwwwww\nw.*.....w...w\nw..%.w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...#...w\nw.*www..w\nw%......w\nw..$...&w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> &\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> $\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> *\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> %\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",
