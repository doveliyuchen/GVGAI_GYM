The presence of an avatar that can interact with various sprites, including enemies and items, suggests a focus on exploration and combat.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**: The game features various sprites, including:\n   - **Avatar**: The player's character that can shoot and interact with other sprites.\n   - **Enemies**: Different types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that can harm the avatar.\n   - **Items**: Keys and swords that provide different abilities or advantages.\n   - **Goals**: A door that can only be accessed with a key.\n   - **Walls**: Impassable barriers that shape the level layout.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can attack enemies with a sword, gaining points for defeating them.\n   - The avatar can collect a key to transform from a \"nokey\" state to a \"withkey\" state, allowing access to the goal.\n   - The avatar can be harmed by enemies, resulting in a score penalty.\n   - The avatar can step back when encountering walls or when trying to access the goal without a key.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game is won when the avatar reaches the goal with the key.\n   - The game is lost if the avatar is defeated (score goes negative).\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to reach the goal (the green door) by collecting the key while avoiding or defeating enemies. The player must navigate through the level, interact with items, and manage encounters with enemies to achieve this goal.\n\n### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: The player wins by reaching the goal with the key, which increments the score.\n- **Loss Condition**: The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy, resulting in a negative score.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore the Level**: Familiarize yourself with the layout to identify the locations of the key and the goal. Look for paths that minimize encounters with enemies.\n\n2. **Collect the Key**: Prioritize finding and collecting the key (transforming from \"nokey\" to \"withkey\") as it is essential for accessing the goal.\n\n3. **Manage Enemy Encounters**: \n   - Use the sword to defeat enemies for points, but be cautious of taking damage.\n   - Consider avoiding enemies when possible to maintain health and avoid score penalties.\n\n4. **Utilize Movement Wisely**: \n   - Be aware of the cooldowns of enemies and plan your movements accordingly to avoid being cornered.\n   - Use the walls to your advantage to create barriers between you and enemies.\n\n5. **Score Management**: Keep track of your score. If you find yourself in a situation where you might lose points (e.g., being attacked by an enemy), consider retreating or finding a safer path.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the game, collect necessary items, and reach the goal while minimizing risks from enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nkey monsterNormal -> 'k'\nsword wall -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw....ww.....w\nw.&..w.....*w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w....%....w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw$...w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw$..#...w\nw..www&.w\nw.......w\nw.......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w%...w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w.w*.w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.",
