It involves exploration, combat, and item collection, typical of games where players navigate through levels to achieve specific objectives.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites:**\n   - **Avatar:** The player character that can shoot a sword.\n   - **Enemies:** Various types of monsters (quick, normal, slow) that the player must avoid or defeat.\n   - **Key and Goal:** The player must collect a key to unlock a door (goal) to win the level.\n   - **Walls and Floors:** These are immovable obstacles that define the level layout.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - The player can interact with walls, keys, and enemies.\n   - Collecting a key transforms the avatar from \"nokey\" to \"withkey,\" allowing access to the goal.\n   - Defeating enemies grants score points, while being hit by an enemy results in a score penalty.\n\n3. **Movement:**\n   - The player can move around the level, but must navigate carefully to avoid enemies and obstacles.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to collect the key and reach the goal (door) to win the level. The player must also manage interactions with enemies to maximize their score and avoid losing health or lives.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal (door) while holding the key.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n\n1. **Explore the Level:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the layout of the level. Identify where the key and goal are located, as well as the positions of enemies.\n\n2. **Collect the Key:**\n   - Prioritize finding and collecting the key. This is essential for accessing the goal.\n\n3. **Avoid Enemies:**\n   - Be cautious around enemies. If possible, defeat them to gain points, but avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to losing health.\n\n4. **Use the Sword Wisely:**\n   - Since the avatar can shoot a sword, use it strategically to defeat enemies when safe. Keep an eye on the cooldowns of enemy movements to time your attacks effectively.\n\n5. **Plan Your Path:**\n   - Once you have the key, plan your route to the goal. Avoid areas with multiple enemies if you are low on health or if you are not confident in defeating them.\n\n6. **Score Management:**\n   - Keep track of your score. While defeating enemies is beneficial, ensure that you do not take damage that could lead to a loss.\n\nBy following these strategies, players can effectively navigate the level, collect necessary items, and achieve the goal while minimizing risks from enemies.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\n**floor strategy: Use floor spaces to maneuver and explore for the key while avoiding enemies** without **Alert**Evaluation: BAD \\Feedback: The last action did not effectively progress the agent toward winning, as it did not move closer to the goal '@' or acquire any keys or items. The agent remains in a dangerous position, surrounded by two monsters (monsterNormal and monsterQuick), which significantly increases the risk of being attacked. Additionally, the action did not facilitate acquiring the sword or any other beneficial items, which could have improved the agent's situation. Overall, the action was not aligned with the objectives of reaching the goal and enhancing the agent's capabilities, making it a poor choice in the current context.\n\nPlease understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw....ww...%.w\nw..$.w....*.w\nw.w...&.wwwww\nw#w.........w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw....w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...#...w\nw..www..w\nw.....$.w\nw.......w\nww.w..www\nw..w.&.ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w*%w\nw@.w.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> %\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> $\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> *\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> &\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w",

The avatar currently does not have the key, which is essential to reach the goal.\n\nGiven the current situation, the best action is to move towards the key while avoiding enemies. The avatar can move left to (7, 10), but that would not progress towards the key. Instead, moving up to (6, 11) is a better option as it allows for further exploration without immediate danger from enemies.\n\nThus, I will choose to move up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to help the avatar navigate towards the key while avoiding immediate threats from enemies.",
