It involves navigating a map, interacting with items (like keys and enemies), solving for goals, and achieving victory through strategy.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n1. **Sprites/Characters:**\n   - **Avatar:** Represents the player character that can shoot a sword.\n   - **Enemies:** Different types (quick, normal, slow) that react to the avatar (i.e., combat mechanics).\n   - **Goal:** A green door that the player must reach, which can only be accessed with a key.\n   - **Key:** Required to unlock the goal; transforms the avatar when collected.\n   - **Walls:** Impassable barriers that shape the level layout.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - Players can step back from walls and doors if they do not have the key.\n   - The avatar can defeat enemies with the sword, gaining points for defeating them and losing points if defeated.\n   - Collecting the key transforms the avatar, which is essential for progressing toward the goal.\n\n3. **Scoring System:**\n   - Gaining points by defeating enemies and collecting the key.\n   - Losing points when the avatar is defeated or stepping back from walls/doors incorrectly.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe main objective is to reach the goal (the green door) by collecting the key while also defeating enemies to accumulate points. Successful navigation and interaction with the environment are crucial to reach the end goal.\n\n**Win/Loss Conditions:**\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by reaching the goal with the key in hand.\n- **Loss Condition:** The game is lost if the avatar is defeated (i.e., if the sprite count for the avatar reaches zero).\n\n### Overall Strategy Suggestions:\n1. **Explore the Level:** Start by exploring the area carefully to locate the key. Be mindful not to engage too aggressively with enemies initially if you are low on health.\n\n2. **Manage Combat:** Only engage with enemies when you\u2019re confident in your ability to defeat them without being hit. Utilize the environment (like walls) to your advantage, as stepping back can put distance between you and enemies.\n\n3. **Collect the Key:** Focus on acquiring the key as soon as possible. Transforming into the 'withkey' sprite is essential for accessing the goal door.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Losses:** Pay attention to enemy patterns (quick, normal, slow) and avoid confrontations that could lead to the avatar being defeated. Use careful timing to attack while minimizing exposure to enemy attacks.\n\n5. **Maximize Points:** Defeating enemies provides valuable points. If you feel strong enough, take the opportunity to clear out enemies that block pathways toward the key or the goal.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies and understanding the rules, players can effectively navigate the level, collect the key, and reach the goal to win the game.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD  \nFeedback: The last action taken did not progress toward winning, as it did not move the agent closer to the goal (@) and instead kept the agent close to the monsterSlow, significantly increasing the risk of encountering danger. Furthermore, the action did not take advantage of available resources such as the nokey and sword, which could have offered a strategic advantage. The overall choice did not effectively align with the objectives of reaching the goal or mitigating threats. The reward of 0.0 from the environment confirms that this action was ineffective and did not contribute positively to the game's progress.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword wall -> 'k'\nsword -> 'm'\nnokey sword -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw....ww.....w\nw....w......w\nw.w.&...wwwww\nw#w....*%...w\nw$w..wwwwwwww\nw.......w...w\nw....w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw..$#...w\nw..www..w\nw.......w\nw....&..w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w*...w\nw.ww%w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> .\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> &\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> *\nrow=4, col=8 -> %\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> $\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n``` \n**sword strategy: Collect the nearby sword to enhance combat capabilities, enabling effective engagement with enemies; also focus on acquiring the nearby nokey to prepare for accessing the goal** with **Alert** \n```",

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is positioned in a manner where it can directly access a sword (represented by `m`) and a nokey (represented by `*`). \n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- The avatar (`A`) is located at (row 7, col 11) and can take two actions:\n  1. Move left to collect the nokey (`*`) at (row 4, col 7).\n  2. Move down to engage with the sword (`m`) at (row 4, col 1) before heading toward the goal (`@`).\n\nBoth items are essential for progressing through the game:\n- Collecting the nokey transforms the avatar into the 'withkey' state, which is necessary for accessing the goal.\n- Acquiring the sword enhances combat capabilities, allowing defeat of enemies for points.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nGiven the strategic importance of acquiring the nokey first to access the goal, I will take the action to move left to the nokey.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action is expected to align with the strategy of collecting essential items to progress towards winning the game.",
