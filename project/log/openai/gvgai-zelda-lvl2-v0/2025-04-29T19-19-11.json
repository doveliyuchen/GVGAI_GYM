Players engage with both enemies and environmental puzzles.\n\n#### Mechanics\n- **Sprites:** Different sprite types represent various entities in the game such as the avatar (player), goals, keys, enemies, and walls.\n- **Movement and Interaction:** Players control an avatar that can shoot a sword at enemies. The avatar can also interact with keys and goals to progress through the game.\n- **Random NPCs:** Enemies are categorized based on their speed (quick, normal, slow) and have cooldowns that determine their action frequency.\n- **Transformation System:** The avatar can transform from a \"nokey\" state (no key) to a \"withkey\" state upon picking up a key, enabling the interaction with the goal.\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective is to navigate through the level, collect keys, interact with the goal, and defeat enemies to score points. Players must reach the goal (the door) with the key to win the game.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition:** The player wins by interacting with the goal while holding a key, which increases their score and leads to victory.\n- **Loss Condition:** The player loses if the avatar is defeated by an enemy, decreasing their score and ending the game.\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Explore Carefully:** Move through the level, taking care to explore and identify paths that lead to keys and the goal. The lay of the land should inform your approach to tackling enemies and obstacles.\n\n2. **Gather Keys:** Prioritize collecting keys to enable access to the goal. Ensure you engage with the \"nokey\" key interaction to transform into \"withkey\" as soon as possible.\n\n3. **Combat Strategy:** \n   - Use your sword effectively to defeat enemies, focusing on avoiding getting hit to prevent losing points. \n   - Recognize the types of enemies and their behaviors based on their speed; adjust your attack and flee strategy accordingly.\n\n4. **Navigating Walls and Obstacles:** Be aware of the immovable walls and layout. Use them to your advantage, keeping distance from enemies and positioning yourself to maximize your ability to attack while minimizing exposure to danger.\n\n5. **Score Maximization:** Attempt to defeat as many enemies as possible for additional points. However, balance this with the need to reach the goal - sometimes it's wiser to bypass enemies to secure victory.\n\n##### Conclusion\nThis game promotes a blend of strategic exploration, combat, and resource management, urging players to think ahead while reacting to dynamic in-game challenges. Engaging in combat should be balanced with the overall goal of progressing through the level and achieving victory.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== Feedback === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD \\Feedback: The agent's last action did not effectively progress toward winning, as it did not move closer to the key or the goal. The agent remains near monsterNormal and monsterQuick, which significantly increases the risk of danger. This action does not align with the strategic objective of navigating the environment safely while collecting necessary resources. Consequently, this ineffective decision resulted in a reward of 0.0 from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw..&.ww.....w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w........%w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw$......w...w\nw*...w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw*$.#...w\nw..www..w\nw......&w\nw.......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w%w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> %\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> $\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> .\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> *\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> .\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```\n**key strategy: Move towards the nearest key to transition from 'nokey' to 'withkey', enabling interaction with the goal** without **Alert**\n\n**goal strategy: Approach the goal only after successfully obtaining a key for interaction** without **Alert**\n\n**monster strategy: Avoid being adjacent to both monsterNormal and monsterQuick to minimize the risk of being defeated** with **Alert**\n\n**wall strategy: Utilize walls effectively to navigate safely and create barriers between the avatar and enemies** without **Alert**\n\n**sword strategy: Be prepared to use the sword defensively against monsters if necessary, while focusing on avoiding combat to ensure safety** with **Alert**\n```",
