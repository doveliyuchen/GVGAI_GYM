The presence of keys, doors, and various sprites suggests it may have goals typical of these genres, such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and navigating enemies.\n\n#### Mechanics\n1. **Sprites**:\n   - **Avatar**: The player-controlled character that can shoot or wield a sword.\n   - **Enemies**: Various types of monsters with different speed and strength (Quick, Normal, Slow).\n   - **Goals**: Keys are needed to transition between areas indicated by doors; you must collect keys and defeat enemies to achieve victory.\n   - **Movable Walls**: The game includes obstacles and barriers that must be navigated.\n   - **Score System**: Points can be gained by defeating enemies and collecting keys or reaching the goal with a key.\n\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - The avatar can kill enemies and transform when collecting keys.\n   - If the avatar tries to access the goal without a key, they will be sent back (forced to retreat).\n   - Player health appears to be represented as a score, and if the avatar meets an enemy, they can lose points.\n\n3. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - The game ends with victory if the player successfully reaches the goal with a key.\n   - The player loses if the avatar is defeated (i.e., reaches a score change of negative one).\n\n#### Objective\nThe primary objective of the game is to collect keys and reach the goal (the green door) while defeating or avoiding enemies. Successfully reaching the goal with a key will score points and lead to victory.\n\n#### Win/Loss Conditions\n- **Win Condition**: Reach the goal with a key (indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=goal win=True`).\n- **Loss Condition**: The avatar is defeated by an enemy (indicated by `SpriteCounter stype=avatar win=False`).\n\n### Overall Strategy\n1. **Exploration**: Explore the map thoroughly to locate keys and identify enemy positions. Make a mental note of where key doors are located and the locations of movable walls.\n  \n2. **Enemy Management**: Engage enemies strategically using the sword. Since defeating enemies provides extra points, prioritize taking them out unless in danger of losing health.\n\n3. **Key Collection**: Focus on collecting keys as they are necessary for accessing the goal. Look for opportunities where you can defeat enemies to collect keys without running into hazards.\n\n4. **Pathfinding**: Pay attention to the map layout. Identify paths that lead to goals while avoiding bottlenecks where enemies may trap you. \n\n5. **Avoid Unnecessary Risks**: If you are low on health or feel outnumbered by enemies, retreat and regroup instead of forcing an engagement.\n\n6. **Utilize Movable Walls**: Use movable walls to create paths or block enemies if the mechanics allow for it, thus enabling strategic retreats or flanking opportunities.\n\nBy mastering these strategies while navigating the game environment, players can optimize their chances of success and accumulate the necessary points to win.\n\nYou are an intelligent player playing a video game, and you have a friend provide you strategy. Interpret the state, rule, strategy and act accordingly. Notice that your avatar position is one of the most important information, if the position doesn't change from the last state, you need to analyze the state and make a different action from the last time.\n\n=== Available Actions ===\n0: ACTION_NIL\n1: ACTION_USE\n2: ACTION_LEFT\n3: ACTION_RIGHT\n4: ACTION_DOWN\n5: ACTION_UP\n\n=== High Level Plan === \n\n\nEvaluation: BAD \\Feedback: The last action did not progress toward winning, as it failed to help the agent move closer to the goal or facilitate the acquisition of any valuable items, such as the sword or key. Additionally, it left the agent in close proximity to a dangerous monster (monsterNormal), increasing the risk without providing any strategic advantage. This ineffectiveness combined with heightened risk resulted in a reward of 0.0 from the environment.\n\n=== Important Mechanics Notice ===\n In some games, directional actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) may first cause the avatar to rotate toward the intended direction without immediately moving. If the avatar's position does not change after a directional action, it may indicate a rotation has occurred. To proceed, you must apply the directional action again after rotation. Always verify whether the avatar actually moved after each action. Please understand the rule and the interaction set first, then locate the item, finally choose a meaningful action towards the win and respond in the format: ``` Action:<action number> ```. Include one sentence of feedback on the action and your expectation to see if it aligns with the strategy. Notice, Action 0 will not reasult in any change in this game environment, and you may need to understand the level layout first to play the game. \n\n=== Sprite Mapping ===\navatar -> 'a'\nfloor goal -> 'g'\nfloor key -> '+'\nfloor nokey -> 'A'\nfloor monsterQuick -> '1'\nfloor monsterNormal -> '2'\nfloor monsterSlow -> '3'\nwall -> 'w'\nfloor -> '.'\ngoal -> '@'\nkey -> '#'\nmonsterNormal -> '$'\nmonsterQuick -> '%'\nmonsterSlow -> '&'\nnokey -> '*'\nsword -> 'k'\nnokey sword -> 'm'\nsword wall -> 'n'\n\n=== Current State ===\n=== Original State ===\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\nw..&.ww.....w\nw....w......w\nw.w.....wwwww\nw#w.........w\nw.w..wwwwwwww\nw..*....w...w\nw..$.w....w@w\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n=== Rotated State (Y-axis emphasis) ===\nwwwwwwwww\nw...#...w\nw..www..w\nw$*....&w\nw.......w\nww.w..www\nw..w...ww\nw..w....w\nw.ww.w..w\nw..w.w..w\nww.w.w..w\nw@.w.w..w\nwwwwwwwww\nNote: In the original state, each row corresponds to horizontal (left-right) layout in the game.\nIn the rotated version, each row corresponds to vertical (up-down) layout.=== Map in Natural language ===\nEach line shows entity at (row, col).\nIn rotated version, row emphasizes vertical (up-down).\nrow=0, col=0 -> w\nrow=0, col=1 -> w\nrow=0, col=2 -> w\nrow=0, col=3 -> w\nrow=0, col=4 -> w\nrow=0, col=5 -> w\nrow=0, col=6 -> w\nrow=0, col=7 -> w\nrow=0, col=8 -> w\nrow=0, col=9 -> w\nrow=0, col=10 -> w\nrow=0, col=11 -> w\nrow=0, col=12 -> w\nrow=1, col=0 -> w\nrow=1, col=1 -> .\nrow=1, col=2 -> .\nrow=1, col=3 -> &\nrow=1, col=4 -> .\nrow=1, col=5 -> w\nrow=1, col=6 -> w\nrow=1, col=7 -> .\nrow=1, col=8 -> .\nrow=1, col=9 -> .\nrow=1, col=10 -> .\nrow=1, col=11 -> .\nrow=1, col=12 -> w\nrow=2, col=0 -> w\nrow=2, col=1 -> .\nrow=2, col=2 -> .\nrow=2, col=3 -> .\nrow=2, col=4 -> .\nrow=2, col=5 -> w\nrow=2, col=6 -> .\nrow=2, col=7 -> .\nrow=2, col=8 -> .\nrow=2, col=9 -> .\nrow=2, col=10 -> .\nrow=2, col=11 -> .\nrow=2, col=12 -> w\nrow=3, col=0 -> w\nrow=3, col=1 -> .\nrow=3, col=2 -> w\nrow=3, col=3 -> .\nrow=3, col=4 -> .\nrow=3, col=5 -> .\nrow=3, col=6 -> .\nrow=3, col=7 -> .\nrow=3, col=8 -> w\nrow=3, col=9 -> w\nrow=3, col=10 -> w\nrow=3, col=11 -> w\nrow=3, col=12 -> w\nrow=4, col=0 -> w\nrow=4, col=1 -> #\nrow=4, col=2 -> w\nrow=4, col=3 -> .\nrow=4, col=4 -> .\nrow=4, col=5 -> .\nrow=4, col=6 -> .\nrow=4, col=7 -> .\nrow=4, col=8 -> .\nrow=4, col=9 -> .\nrow=4, col=10 -> .\nrow=4, col=11 -> .\nrow=4, col=12 -> w\nrow=5, col=0 -> w\nrow=5, col=1 -> .\nrow=5, col=2 -> w\nrow=5, col=3 -> .\nrow=5, col=4 -> .\nrow=5, col=5 -> w\nrow=5, col=6 -> w\nrow=5, col=7 -> w\nrow=5, col=8 -> w\nrow=5, col=9 -> w\nrow=5, col=10 -> w\nrow=5, col=11 -> w\nrow=5, col=12 -> w\nrow=6, col=0 -> w\nrow=6, col=1 -> .\nrow=6, col=2 -> .\nrow=6, col=3 -> *\nrow=6, col=4 -> .\nrow=6, col=5 -> .\nrow=6, col=6 -> .\nrow=6, col=7 -> .\nrow=6, col=8 -> w\nrow=6, col=9 -> .\nrow=6, col=10 -> .\nrow=6, col=11 -> .\nrow=6, col=12 -> w\nrow=7, col=0 -> w\nrow=7, col=1 -> .\nrow=7, col=2 -> .\nrow=7, col=3 -> $\nrow=7, col=4 -> .\nrow=7, col=5 -> w\nrow=7, col=6 -> .\nrow=7, col=7 -> .\nrow=7, col=8 -> .\nrow=7, col=9 -> .\nrow=7, col=10 -> w\nrow=7, col=11 -> @\nrow=7, col=12 -> w\nrow=8, col=0 -> w\nrow=8, col=1 -> w\nrow=8, col=2 -> w\nrow=8, col=3 -> w\nrow=8, col=4 -> w\nrow=8, col=5 -> w\nrow=8, col=6 -> w\nrow=8, col=7 -> w\nrow=8, col=8 -> w\nrow=8, col=9 -> w\nrow=8, col=10 -> w\nrow=8, col=11 -> w\nrow=8, col=12 -> w\n\n===Long-term Plan===\n```\n**key strategy: Actively search for and collect keys to unlock the goal and facilitate progress in the game** without **Alert**  \n**monster strategy: Engage and strategically defeat nearby monsters to minimize threats and maximize points** with **Alert**  \n**goal strategy: Approach the goal only when in possession of a key to ensure successful completion** without **Alert**  \n**nokey strategy: Transform nokey into withkey by collecting surrounding keys to simplify access to the goal** without **Alert**  \n**sword strategy: Utilize the sword effectively to defeat monsters while maintaining a safe distance from danger** with **Alert**  \n**exploration strategy: Identify and navigate safe paths toward keys and objectives while avoiding encounters with dangerous monsters** with **Alert**  \n**retreat strategy: If surrounded by threats or near a monster, backtrack to a safer area to reassess potential actions** with **Alert**  \n```",
