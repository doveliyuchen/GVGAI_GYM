Specifically, the enemies ($ and @) are positioned in such a way that they may eventually move downward and threaten the base.\n\n### Current Strategy\n1. **Emergency Actions:** The strategy must focus on quickly eliminating or distancing from threats, especially as the enemies can spawn and inflict damage on the base if left unchecked.\n2. **Positioning:** The avatar should assess whether a defensive position or an attack route needs to be taken, particularly since it has a clear advantage in controlling its moves.\n\n### Available Actions\nGiven the analysis of the enemy locations above the current avatar position, it would be advantageous to **move right** towards potential evasive actions and avoid being targeted from above.\n\n#### Taking Action\nThe current action I will take is to move **right** from (10,1) to (10,2):\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right is a strategic choice to maintain mobility and allow for potential attacks against the enemies directly above in subsequent turns."
