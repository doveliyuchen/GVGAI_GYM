Movement is critical for survival.\n2. **Movement Direction Choose**: The available actions are left (move to column 0) or right (move to column 2). Moving left to (10, 0) puts the avatar into a position where it would not receive immediate threat but it could expose itself to further navigation issues later on, as there\u2019s a potential cluster nearby. Moving right (to column 2) would still keep the avatar in a relatively safe zone, as row 10 is mostly empty.\n\nConsidering this, moving right is a more strategic choice to maintain a good position while continuing to evaluate threats from the aliens. \n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action will allow for a reposition towards potential safer areas without moving directly into the danger zones.
