I must assess potential safe zones where I can retaliate effectively against the enemies.\n\n### Action Decision:\nConsidering the available options and the need to move away from the bombs, I will take the left action to move the avatar. However, since moving left is not possible from column 0, I will check the other potential movements.\n\nGiven that I cannot go left, my only option is to attempt to move right.
