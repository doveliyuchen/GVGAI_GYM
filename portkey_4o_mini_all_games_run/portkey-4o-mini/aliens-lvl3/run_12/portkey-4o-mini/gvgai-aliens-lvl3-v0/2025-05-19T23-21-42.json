The objective is to eliminate alien sprites '@' while avoiding being hit by their bombs '%'. \n\n### Analyzing the Current State\nThe immediate area above your avatar has several alien sprites in rows 0 to 2. The spawning points for the aliens are seen in the upper rows with no visible bombs or immediate threats around the avatar at its current position. \n\n### Reasoning for Action\nYour avatar can either choose to **move left**, **move right**, or **use an action** (like firing missiles). Since your current position has not changed and is safe from immediate threats, movement should be considered to reposition for better visibility and attack capacity against the aliens. \n\n### Action Decision\nGiven the layout, moving **left** to (row 10, col 0) would not be advantageous as it is an empty space, and keep your icon closer to the center might be more beneficial in terms of firing at the aliens. \n\nYou initially need to attempt a **RIGHT** action since the avatar does not need to rotate and can position itself better for firing at aliens while keeping an eye on potential threats thereafter. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will reposition the avatar ideally to a column where it can have a wider range of fire while assessing the state ahead for incoming threats. I expect to see if we can target aliens above more effectively."

There are multiple alien sprites ('@') above the avatar along row 0 through row 2, and some of them might pose a threat based on their attacking abilities.\n\n### Analysis of Actions:\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar is positioned quite low on the map (row 10). To effectively engage the aliens, it makes sense to move horizontally in order to find a better positioning that allows for more effective shooting without risking being hit.\n\n2. **Available Actions**:\n   - **ACTION_USE**: This would involve using a missile to attack an alien.
