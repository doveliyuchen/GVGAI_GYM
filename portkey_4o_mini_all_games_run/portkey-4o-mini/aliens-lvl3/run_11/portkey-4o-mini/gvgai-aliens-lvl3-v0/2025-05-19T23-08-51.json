Moving to the right (towards (10, 2)) keeps the avatar in a better position to potentially shoot upward or left in subsequent actions. Since there are aliens directly higher in columns that need to be engaged.\n\nTherefore, I will choose:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis should help to reposition the avatar closer to a line of sight where I can attack the alien threats effectively on the next turn."
