While there are no immediate threats to me, it's important to stay aware of potential bomb threats derived from those aliens.\n  \n2. **Base Protection:** My base ('#') occupies the first two columns in rows 1 and 2. My immediate goal should be to protect the base from the spawning aliens.\n\n3. **Objective:** The objective revolves around eliminating spawning aliens and preventing them from reaching the base, while increasing my score.\n\n4. **Possible Actions:**\n   - Move left (to (10,0)): This would not provide any immediate benefit since there isn't a target nor space for strategic movement to combat the nearest threats effectively.\n   - Move right (to (10,2)): This would get me closer to the aliens in the (0,2) to (0,8) range, potentially making targeting them easier while maintaining a safe distance from their threats.\n\nNoting that my avatar position hasn\u2019t changed from the last state, I need to take action to change my situation effectively by moving to potentially engage the aliens actively. \n\nThus, I will take action to move right towards the active alien threats.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis will position me closer to the group of aliens, allowing for strategic targeting in subsequent turns while keeping my base defended."
