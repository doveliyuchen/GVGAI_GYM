The winning strategy involves managing citizens and ensuring they do not get cursed or overwhelmed by demons.\n\n### Current State\n- The notable items around the avatar:\n  - The output portal (`*`) is directly to the right (12, 31).\n  - The avatar is surrounded by various sprites, including citizens (`%`) and the portal.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the primary goal is to escort citizens to the output portal and the portal is immediately accessible to the right of the avatar, the optimal action is to move **RIGHT**.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThe expectation is that this move will achieve the escort of a citizen if they are close enough to the portal or aid in positioning for future moves.

However, since the avatar is currently at the rightmost edge (column 31), moving to the left (to column 30) would be a suitable first action.\n\nChoosing the action to move left:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to maneuver toward the citizen and ensure their blessing as part of the strategy while being mindful of the cooldown mechanics inherent in the game, keeping the flow of citizens manageable."
