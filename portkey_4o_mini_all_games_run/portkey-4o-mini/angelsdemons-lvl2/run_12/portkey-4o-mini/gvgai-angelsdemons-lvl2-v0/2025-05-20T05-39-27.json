It is currently at position (12, 7).\n2. **Objective**: We aim to transform 'citizens' into 'blessed' without allowing any to become 'cursed'. The game state indicates there are several citizens on the map, specifically at coordinates (12, 2), (12, 8), (12, 9), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 27), (12, 28), and (12, 29), and we need to manage their movement effectively towards the output which is at (12, 31).\n3. **Nearby Elements**: The surroundings include citizens, a spawn point to the left, and boxes.\n4. **Potential Actions**: \n   - Moving left (to (12, 6)) could potentially create more space, but given the presence of boxes, it may not provide much strategic advantage.\n   - Moving down (to (13, 7)) or up (to (11, 7)) doesn't present immediate pathways to citizens.\n   - Moving right would bring us closer to the output and potentially allow more citizens to be directed towards 'blessed' transformations.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will choose:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar one step to the right towards (12, 8), which is adjacent to a citizen, allowing for further interactions and facilitating the movement of citizens towards the output. This aligns with the overall strategy of managing citizens effectively while minimizing the risk of turning them cursed."
