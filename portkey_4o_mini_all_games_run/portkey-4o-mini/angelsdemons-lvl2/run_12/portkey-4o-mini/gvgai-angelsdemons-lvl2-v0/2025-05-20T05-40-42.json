The immediate row is filled with various sprites: two citizens (one at (12,0) and another at (12,1)), and they have potential for transformation into blessed citizens. Moreover, the movement of bolts doesn't seem to be immediately threatening, but I need to avoid them, especially since there are red projectiles on the map (the position of which is not directly affecting me right now).\n\nAccording to the suggested strategy, I should consider managing the citizens to turn them into blessed citizens, as well as avoiding hazards effectively. The closest citizens are positioned at (12,0) and (12,1), so I will want to move to the left to potentially interact with those citizens.\n\nI will choose to move left (to (12,30)). \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is in line with the strategy, aiming to engage with the nearest citizens and possibly transform them into blessed ones while avoiding unintended interactions with any bolts that aren't currently impacting me."

There are also citizens (represented as '%') around the avatar at positions (row=12, col=1), (row=12, col=2), (row=12, col=7), (row=12, col=8), (row=12, col=14), (row=12, col=20), (row=12, col=21), (row=12, col=26), and (row=12, col=27).\n\nFrom the suggested strategies:\n1. **Objective:** The objective is to convert citizens into blessed citizens and send them through the output portal, while keeping the number of cursed sprites at 1 or less.\n2. **Action Assessment:** The current position of the avatar does not require immediate lateral movement, as it can already reach the output portal. Given that there are no hazards (no bolts in the vicinity) and the avatar's position is optimal for sending citizens through the portal, we can make a decision to move in a manner that maximizes citizen conversion and maintains our safe state.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most fitting action would be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis means moving the avatar to the right into the output portal, allowing for a potential scoring opportunity.
