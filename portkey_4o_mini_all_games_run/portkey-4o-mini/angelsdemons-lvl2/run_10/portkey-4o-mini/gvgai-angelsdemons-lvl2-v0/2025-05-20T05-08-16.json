The immediate area surrounding my avatar is predominantly made up of walls, making movement options limited.\n2. Nearby (row=11, col=31) there are walls, while (row=12, col=30) holds a blessed sprite.\n3. There are many citizens (represented by '%') nearby, indicating possible interactions through salvation or cursing via bolts.\n\n### Strategy\nSince my avatar did not move from last action, I need to consider rotating towards a new direction and make an actionable move thereafter. The direction options to interact with and potentially achieve objectives include moving towards the blessed sprites for possible interactions.\n\nNow, I will choose to rotate and then move left to explore and interact with nearby sprites effectively.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow me a chance to reposition towards useful sprites or citizens, enabling effective strategy deployment for salvation or guiding citizens."
