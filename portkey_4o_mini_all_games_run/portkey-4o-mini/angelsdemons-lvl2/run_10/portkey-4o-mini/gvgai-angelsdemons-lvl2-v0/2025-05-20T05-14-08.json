Moreover, the immediate left position (12, 21) is already occupied by a citizen, meaning a left action would allow you to make direct contact with that citizen and potentially convert them.\n\n### Action Decision:\n- Move **Left** to position (12, 21), which allows for the possibility of blessing the citizen next to your avatar.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left will allow me to interact with the citizen next to me, leading towards a blessed state, which aligns with the strategy of managing citizens effectively."

Since my avatar is currently positioned at the edge, the movement options are either to the left or upward. However, moving up doesn't change the column position significantly as it might lead to walls, and moving left seems to remain in a position with potential citizens to interact with.\n\nGiven these considerations, a move to the left (action 1) could potentially bring the avatar to interact with the citizens and maximize the chance of transformation into 'blessed' while monitoring the timer.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThe expectation is that moving left will position the avatar closer to the citizens, thus facilitating better strategic interaction in the following moves."
