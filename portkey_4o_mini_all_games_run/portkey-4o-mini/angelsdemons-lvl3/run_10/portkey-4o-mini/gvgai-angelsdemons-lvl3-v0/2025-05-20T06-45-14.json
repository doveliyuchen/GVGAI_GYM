The avatar's position is crucial, as it is responsible for protecting these citizens from being cursed and guiding them to the output portal at (12, 0).\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- The avatar is in a relatively open area where it can maneuver well.\n- Citizens at (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 12), (12, 13), and (12, 25) are potentially at risk if enemy sprites (like bolts) approach.\n- The output portal is directly to the left (12, 0), which could be a valid escape route for the blessed citizens if I can guide them properly.\n  \n### Strategy:\nTo prioritize the safety of the citizens, I need to decide on an action to actively protect them from potential threats and help any cursed citizens reach the output portal quickly.\n\nGiven that my avatar did not change position previously (I need to act now), I will move the avatar left towards the output portal to ensure the citizens are not impacted by any threats on the right side. \n\nI will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will allow me to proceed towards the output and keep the citizens in a safe space. My expectation is that my movement will align with the overall strategy of scoring points while ensuring the citizens remain unharmed and make it to the output portal."

At this point, moving the avatar could allow interaction with citizens directly ahead.\n\nAs the avatar does not need to rotate to interact with any entities immediately, I will move my avatar down (to row 13) to continue aiding citizens directly above in their transformation opportunities and to access the input point `(12, 31)` in the next turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nIt's essential that my avatar moves downward to reinforce the area with citizens and prepare for any necessary actions in the following turns."
