The optimal goal is to turn the citizens into blessed characters efficiently to limit any potential curse.\n\nWe attempt to move the avatar to the left to interact with the citizen at (12, 2).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will shift the avatar left from (12, 5) to (12, 4) and set up favorable conditions to bless the citizen adjacent to that position.

In our analysis, we must ensure to change the avatar's position meaningfully based on the game mechanics laid out.\n\nHere is the relevant information from the state:\n- **Position of Avatar (a)**: (12, 5)\n- **Nearby Important Entities**:\n  - Citizens (%): At (12, 2), (12, 3), (12, 9), (12, 10), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 22), (12, 28), (12, 29)\n  - Input Sky (i): At (12, 0)\n  - Output Sky (*): At (12, 31)\n- **Walls (d)**: Surround the avatar's possibility of movement and are prevalent on both sides.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. The avatar needs to bless citizens by interacting with them. It is important to move towards the citizens to achieve this.\n2. The avatar should avoid creating cursed characters, so we need to circumvent any negative interactions in the vicinity.\n3. Since the avatar has not moved since the last position, it can only rotate without a meaningful change yet.\n\n### Desired Move:\n- The most direct approach towards blessing citizens (which is indicated by the '%') is to navigate either left (to (12, 4)) or up towards citizens located directly above at (12, 2) and (12, 3). \n\nWith these considerations in mind, our best action is:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThis \"ACTION_UP\" directs the avatar to potentially interact with blessed characters, enhancing the player's ability to bless citizens while avoiding any dangers from nearby demons and projectiles. I expect that this aligns with the strategy of moving toward citizens for interaction."
