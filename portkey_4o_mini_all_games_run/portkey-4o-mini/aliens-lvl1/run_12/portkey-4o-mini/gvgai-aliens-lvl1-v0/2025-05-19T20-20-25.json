Instead, I will try to move left to potentially better position myself, as moving horizontally may yield an advantageous setup.\n\n### Decision to Move\n- Based on the grid and my current position, the safest and most strategic approach, while enforcing mobility, is to try an action that gets me closer to a better position rather than remaining static.\n\n### Action to Take: \n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action will move my avatar to the left to (row=10, col=1).
