There are citizens `$` (input) and `%` (citizens) on the map; the goal is to ensure that some citizens exit through the output `*`.\n3. The input position for citizens is at (12, 0) and (12, 1). The exit position is at (12, 31).\n4. There are two demons (`&`) at (1, 6) and (1, 29) that pose a threat to transforming citizens into cursed sprites.\n5. We need to control the transformations and ensure there's no more than one cursed sprite on the map.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n- The rules indicate that we should avoid interactions with demons to prevent citizens from becoming cursed.\n- The immediate area around the avatar is free of threats, meaning that moving closer to the input points where citizens are could be beneficial.\n  \n### Goal\nThe immediate goal would be either to prevent citizens from being cursed or to guide them toward the exit.\n\n### Potential Actions\n- **Moving Left or Right** might help the avatar either maneuver closer to the input or fan out to control citizen flow. However, since there are no walls to impede lateral movement in the immediate surrounding (rows 6 and 7), **Down** to row 7 or **Up** to row 5 could also be tactically sound depending on future interactions.\n\n**Decision**\nConsidering that both rows directly below (row 7) and above (row 5) present more safe blocks to potentially lead and protect citizens, I will opt to move **Down** to row 7. This will allow me to assess how best to interact with incoming citizens while reducing any threats from the demons.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nMoving down should allow for better positioning to interact with and protect the incoming citizens, aligning with the defensive strategy necessary to avoid creating more cursed sprites."

However, we need to be cautious of the 'demon' sprite represented by '&' found at (1, 9) and (1, 10), which could interact negatively with any citizens that may spawn. \n\n### Objectives:\nThe primary strategies involve:\n1. **Managing citizen transformations positively** to blessed.\n2. **Avoiding more than one cursed sprite at any time.**\n\n### Next Action Decision:\nThe avatar can move freely without immediate threats around it, but we need to consider the next steps to ensure citizens can transform into blessed sprites. A good action would be to move **RIGHT** (Action 2) to remain in a preemptive position for any incoming citizens as we want them to flow towards the salvation points through subsequent portals.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis movement keeps us mobile and allows us to respond quickly to any incoming threats or citizens.

Some transformations are likely occurring which can potentially create cursed sprites.\n- There are chasers ('&') on row 1 that could potentially affect citizen transformation negatively.\n\nConsidering the objectives outlined in the game:\n\n1. The aim is to manage citizen transformations and avoid creating cursed sprites.\n2. The avatar should ideally position itself to help citizens reach the output without interference from the threats.\n\nGiven that the avatar doesn't seem to change position, yes, moves to either left or right are blocked. The situation indicates a need for advance movement downwards towards row 12, which would allow access to the output and manage the citizens more effectively.\n\nTo optimize towards reaching the goal and ensure further interaction with the citizens leading to favorable transformations, I will move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is aimed at positioning the avatar closer to the blessed transformation area while avoiding any threats, thus allowing for better management of subsequent turns.

Nearby, there are several blessings ('%') which I can interact with by moving within the bounds of the game.\n2. **Input and Output**: There is a 'citizen input' at (12, 0), and multiple 'blessed citizens' can be found along the 12th row, particularly at (12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 16), and (12, 23) which can potentially be directed towards the output at (12, 31).\n3. **Surrounding Threats**: There are no immediate threats to the avatar's position right now. \n\n### Action Plan:\n- To maximize points, I want to interact with the nearby blessed spirits and guide them safely. Given that there are no obstacles surrounding my avatar, I should ensure I can move towards more blessed spirits and interact effectively.\n\n### Action Decision:\nConsidering that my current position has not led to significant interactions and focusing on the strategy of movement toward maximizing interactions, I will attempt to move **left** to position myself better within the game.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow me to explore the left side of the current row for potential interactions and ensure citizens can be transformed positively while avoiding any cursed threats."

There is a citizen directly to the right (at (12, 25)).\n2. There are walls nearby, preventing any movement down or left.\n3.
