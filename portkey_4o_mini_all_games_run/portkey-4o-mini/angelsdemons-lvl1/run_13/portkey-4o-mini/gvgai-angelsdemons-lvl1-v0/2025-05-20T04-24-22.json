The immediate strategy would involve moving towards citizens to convert them into blessed sprites or finding a safe path to interact with them.\n\n### Strategy Overview:\n1. **Convert Citizens**: The avatar can move to adjacent citizens `%` to convert more of them.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Keep a safe distance from any nearby hazards, such as the demons '&' or bolts 'o' in rows 1 and 12.\n3. **Utilize Interactions**: Take upcoming opportunities aligned with the scoring mechanism regarding the citizens.\n\nGiven that moving horizontally to the left (towards (12,30)) could potentially move us closer to multiple citizens for conversion while avoiding hazards, I will take action to the left.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action allows me to reposition towards the nearby citizens, increasing the opportunity for conversions while aligning with the overall strategy to score more blessed sprites."
