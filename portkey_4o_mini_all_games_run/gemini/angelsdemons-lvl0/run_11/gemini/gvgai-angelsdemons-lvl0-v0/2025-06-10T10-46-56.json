There are also demons ('&') and angels ('@'). The citizens are marked as '%'.\n\nMy goal is to move the boxes strategically to block the bolts from the demons and guide the citizens towards the output and potentially towards salvation.\n\nFirst, I will try to move to the left to see the environment more clearly.\n\nAction: 1\nI will move to the left to see the box at (10, 4)."
