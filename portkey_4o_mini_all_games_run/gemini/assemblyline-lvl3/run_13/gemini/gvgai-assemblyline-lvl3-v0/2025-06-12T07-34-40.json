This seems crucial to create the `potatofull`. Lasers are likely used to guide the `product` close to the potato and assemble it.\n3. **Laser Cannon Manipulation:** Use the `lever` to rotate laser cannons in the correct directions, which helps guiding the `product` and assembling the potato.\n4. **Navigation:** Be aware of `vortex` placement as it affects the avatar's movement.\n5.  **Timing:** Time is limited, so efficiency is key. Plan laser placements and movements carefully.\n6.  **Guide the potatofull to the goal**\n\nI need to go to the portal first, so I need to move up and left.\nAction: 5\nI expect to move up.```Action: 5```"
