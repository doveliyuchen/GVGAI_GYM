We can't take any meaningful actions until we find the avatar's position.\n2.  **Move the avatar:** Once we find the avatar, we need to get the avatar to the key at row=2, col=6.\n3.  **Move the avatar:** After getting the key, move the avatar to row=8, col=5 to open the nokey.\n4.  **Move the avatar:** Then move the avatar to the goal location at row=8, col=7.\n\nSince the location of avatar is unknown, this round no meaningful action.\n\n```Action:0```\nI can't take any action without knowing the avatar's position."
