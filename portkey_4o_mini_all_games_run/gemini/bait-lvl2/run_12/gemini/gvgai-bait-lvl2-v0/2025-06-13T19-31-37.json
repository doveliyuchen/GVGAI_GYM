The key is at row=2, col=6, and the nokey is at row=7, col=6.\n*   **Level Layout Understanding:** The map reveals a complex layout with boxes '@', holes '$', and walls 'b'. Moving boxes into holes might be necessary to clear paths.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Obtain the Key:** The most immediate step is to acquire the key '%'. This involves navigating to row=2, col=6.\n2.  **Unlock the Nokey:** Once the key is obtained, move to row=7, col=6 to unlock the nokey.\n3.  **Reach the Goal:** After dealing with the nokey, navigate towards the 'goal' '#' at row=8, col=7.\n4.  **Manage Boxes and Holes:** Boxes '@' and holes '$' are scattered around the map. Strategically moving boxes into holes might be required to clear paths to the key, nokey, and finally the goal.\n\n**Action Selection:**\n\nGiven the avatar's current position (6, 1), the initial priority is to move towards the key located at (2, 6). This can be achieved by first moving up towards (2,1), then right towards (2,6).\n\n*   **Action: UP**\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nI expect the avatar to move from (6,1) to (5,1).\n\n```Action: 4```"
