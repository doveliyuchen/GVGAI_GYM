It's highly likely that the game hasn't started and the avatar hasn't been placed in the map, so it can not move for now.\n*   **Obstacles:** 'b' (walls), '@' (boxes), '$' (holes) block the direct path to the goal. '*' (nokey) area.\n*   **Key Items:** '%' (key) is present, which may unlock the '*' (nokey).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Locate Avatar:** Need to figure out the starting position of the avatar. Since there is no avatar on the map currently, the game has not started. No matter what I do, the position will not change.\n2.  **Get the Key:** The key is located at (2, 6). It seems like I need to navigate a maze to get to the goal.\n\n**Action:**\n\nAction: 0\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the avatar is not placed in the map, I should wait for a new state. This action does nothing and is a placeholder until the game starts. It is important to avoid actions that could inadvertently move the avatar in the wrong direction or into a hazard. I will not expect to see changes, as the game has not started."
