I need to analyze the map to find the avatar and the goal, and plan a path. The current map is:\n\n```\n&&&&&\n&#%&&\n&&..&\n&...&\n&&*@&\n&&&&&\n```\n\nI don't see the avatar 'a' in the map. This implies the avatar is not present in the current game state, which is unusual. Given the arrangement of the goal '#' and the 'nokey' '%', as well as the 'box key' '*' and the 'box' '@', it suggests the initial game setup likely has the avatar needing to collect the box key '*' to unlock the box '@' to push it onto the goal '#'.\n\nSince I don't have the avatar, I cannot take any action towards the goal. However, the game description mentions to repeat the directional action if the avatar does not move after taking the action. So, I'm going to assume the avatar's initial position is not provided in the state. I will try moving DOWN in hopes that the avatar exists and is hidden.\n\nAction: 3\n```\nI will try moving DOWN in hopes that the avatar exists and is hidden.\n```"
