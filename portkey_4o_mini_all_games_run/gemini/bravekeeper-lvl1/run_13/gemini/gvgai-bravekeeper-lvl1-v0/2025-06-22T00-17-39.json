The goal is to move the boxes onto 'safe' locations (which are hidden) and avoid the monsters.\n\nThe immediate vicinity looks relatively safe. The monster at (2,1) is close, and there's one at (3,3). I need to be careful.\nLet's start by moving right to explore the area to find 'safe' locations.\n\nAction: 2\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect the avatar to move to the right, from (7,1) to (7,2). This will let me scout the area a bit."
