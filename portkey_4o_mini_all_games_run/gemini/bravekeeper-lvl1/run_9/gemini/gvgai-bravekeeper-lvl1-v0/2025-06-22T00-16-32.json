My primary goal is to survive for 1200 time steps, so I need to prioritize avoiding the monsters.\n\nSince the monsters move randomly, I'll try to move away from them first and then plan my next move based on their new positions. I'll move down to avoid the monster above.\n\nAction: 3\nFeedback: Moving down to avoid the monster above and create some distance."
