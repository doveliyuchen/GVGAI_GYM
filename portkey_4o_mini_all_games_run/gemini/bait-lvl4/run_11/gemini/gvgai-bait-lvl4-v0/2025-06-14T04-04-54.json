    "content": "=== Player strategy ===\nOkay, let's analyze the current state and plan a strategy to solve this puzzle.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n\n*   **Avatar:** The avatar 'a' is not visible on the map, so its position isn't available. This makes planning difficult.\n*   **Key:** The key '%' is at (1,1).\n*   **Goal:** The goal '#' is at (7,4).\n*   **Obstacles:** There are holes '$', boxes '@', and a nokey '*'.\n*   **Walls:** 'b' represents walls.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Find the Avatar:** Since the avatar's starting position isn't known, we need to explore to find it. A systematic approach would be best to ensure full coverage.\n2.  **Get the Key:** Once the avatar is found, the primary goal is to acquire the key at (1,1).\n3.  **Solve the Puzzles:** There are boxes and holes that might need to be manipulated to reach the goal. The nokey '*' suggests a locked door.\n4.  **Reach the Goal:** After obtaining the key and clearing the path, navigate the avatar to the goal at (7,4).\n\n**Action Selection:**\n\nWithout knowing the avatar's position, let's start by exploring. Let's try moving RIGHT (2) to start. It's possible the avatar is near the left edge.\n\n```Action: 2```\n\n**Feedback:** I'm choosing to move RIGHT to start exploring the map. My expectation is to find the avatar and begin navigating towards the key."
