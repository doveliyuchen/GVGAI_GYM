    "content": "Okay, I need to move to a location where I can increase the butterfly population by leading them to the cocoons, while simultaneously avoiding getting killed by them. Currently, I am at (2,23). There is a cocoon at (1,24) and another at (9,24). There are butterflies at (5,11), (5,12), (6,4), (6,11), (6,12), (7,4), (7,6), (7,7), (7,16), (7,17), (8,6), (8,7), (8,16), (8,17). The butterflies are pretty far. Moving down seems like a good option, as it opens a path to potentially lure the butterflies from row 5, 6 to the cocoons.\n\nAction: 3\n```Action: 3```\nI am moving down to row 3, column 23. I expect to be further from the wall and potentially closer to the cocoons, and in a position where I can start influencing the movement of the butterflies."
