George is at (6,16). There are \"quiet\" sprites nearby at (6,18) and (7,18). There are many \"annoyed\" sprites around the map.\nMy goal is to survive for 1000 time units. \"george\" will convert the \"quiet\" citizens into \"annoyed\" state. The player needs to avoid \"george\" converting all the \"quiet\" citizens into \"annoyed\".\nThere is no immediate threat to the avatar.\nThere is a wall above me, to the left, and below me. The best action is to go RIGHT to get away from the wall.\nAction: 3\nI want to move right to have more space to move and potentially avoid George."
