First, I should try moving LEFT to get to either (10, 9) or (10, 8) to avoid rotating and potentially getting stuck. This keeps my current position moving towards the closer resources while evaluating a path away from the chefs' positions.\n\nLet's execute the action to move LEFT:\n\n```Action: 1```\n\nThis move should reposition me closer to the wall while assessing my options further. I expect my action to successfully change my position, allowing me to re-evaluate possible moves in subsequent turns while staying cautious of the chefs."

Since I have no ingredients collected and can only move, I will look into moving up (to (10,11)), as (11,12) (right) leads to the table 'i', and (12,11) (down) leads to an open path but doesn't lead closer to any resources.\n\nHence, given the analysis, I will execute the action to move up:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis should help me avoid the chef and potentially navigate toward an ingredient next turn without directly confronting any obstacles. I expect that this will lead me into a safer position while planning my next move carefully."

The player must collect the ingredients in the specified order while avoiding the chef, represented by '@', which is in several positions: (2, 25), (2, 26), (3, 25), (3, 26), (4, 6), (5, 12), (6, 12), (8, 9), (9, 19), etc. \n\nGiven the current position of the avatar and the chef, the strategy should be to move left towards the flour ingredient (10, 5). The avatar is not currently in direct danger of being caught, as the nearest chef is far from the intended path at this moment.\n\nI'll move the avatar left to collect flour, which is the first step in our sequence.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action should help advance towards collecting the first ingredient, aligning with the strategy of collecting in order and staying cautious of the chef's locations."
