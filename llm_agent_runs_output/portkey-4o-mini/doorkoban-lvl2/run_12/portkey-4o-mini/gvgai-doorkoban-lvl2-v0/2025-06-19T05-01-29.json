The immediate goal here, however, is to find a next move that allows exploration of the environment or possibly to remove a box.\n- **Prioritize Access**: Moving into any of the adjacent empty spaces allows for expanded options for the upcoming moves.\n- **Time Management**: The timer isn\u2019t explicitly indicated here, but it\u2019s vital to act efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the wall blocks downward movement and the exit is above the current row at (10, 1), it makes sense for an immediate move upwards to (10, 9).
