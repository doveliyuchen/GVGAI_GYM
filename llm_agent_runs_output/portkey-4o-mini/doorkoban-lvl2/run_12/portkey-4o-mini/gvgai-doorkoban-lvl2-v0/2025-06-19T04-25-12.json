Moving **LEFT** (to (6, 11)): This position contains a box ('@') directly below the avatar's current position. However, this requires further action as boxes need to be moved efficiently to interact with holes for scoring.\n   \n2.

Moving **DOWN** (to (7, 12)): This position is open, allowing possible moves thereafter, but doesn't affect current strategic scoring.\n\n4. Moving **UP** (to (5, 12)): This leads to an open space but similarly doesn\u2019t progress towards interaction with the exit or scoring.\n\nThe most meaningful and strategic move is **LEFT** to (6, 11) to make use of the box below for manipulation. \n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\nThis action allows for positioning of the avatar to interact with the box and plan further moves towards the exit and scoring holes efficiently.

The exit at (10, 1) is quite far from my current position.\n2. To progress, our immediate goal might be to either interact with the box at (9, 8) to possibly align it towards a hole or make effective moves towards opening a path to the exit.\n3. Moving leftward initially seems viable, but the exit is in the far left direction, and though (10, 7) is accessible, it leads mostly to walls or further open space without immediate obstacles.\n\n### Executing the Action\nSince the avatar needs to progress towards the exit and manage box interactions, the next best move seems to be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action directs the avatar to move left to (10, 7). This will help evaluate the situation better and potentially plan the next necessary move toward the exit while observing all configurations in the immediate vicinity.\n\n### Feedback on Action\nBy moving left, I'm aiming to open more potential paths towards the exit and allow for future interactions if the box becomes necessary to move or reposition. I expect to analyze how the next action unfolds based on surrounding elements after this movement."
