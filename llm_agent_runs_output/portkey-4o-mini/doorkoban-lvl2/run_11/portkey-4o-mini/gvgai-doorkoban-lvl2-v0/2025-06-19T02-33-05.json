However, the wall constrains movement.\n\nAs per the game rules and interactions, since previous actions have resulted in the avatar's position remaining the same, a new action that changes the avatar's position is necessary. \n\nGiven that moving left to (7,10) is blocked (it's a wall) and moving down to (8,11) is also not an optimal route because it leads to a wall eventually blocking further movement, the action chosen will be to move left toward a better strategic position for future paths.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action aims to reposition towards (7,10) which might lead to an evaluation of further actions like downward or even moving right to (7,12) later, contingent on further strategy."
