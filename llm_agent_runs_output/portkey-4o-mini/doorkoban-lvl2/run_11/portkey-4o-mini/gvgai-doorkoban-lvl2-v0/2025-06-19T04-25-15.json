We need to consider whether moving these boxes strategically could help us progress or gain points.\n4. **Nearby Interactions**: The exit (10, 1) is blocked by a wall immediately to the left (10, 0), but there is another path down which the avatar may need to navigate.\n\nConsidering that the avatar's last action should be a directional move downwards towards the exit but resulted in a static position, it's essential to ensure we are indeed making progress. \n\nSince the avatar is facing down and the wall is directly above (8, 11), moving downwards (to (8, 11)) does not yield any immediate benefit. Thus, our previous action should be revised and a new action taken to gain forward momentum towards hopefully maneuvering closer to other components like boxes or holes.\n\nI will take the action downward once more to further evaluate the possibilities down at (8, 11).\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action aims to evaluate whether moving down opens additional paths toward the exit or further interactions with boxes."
