I will attempt to rotate the avatar first to inspect the situation better.\n\n``` Action: 0 ```\nThis action indicates that I will take no action at this moment, but it is necessary to reassess the environment due to wall restrictions before deciding on the next step."

The avatar is eight columns away from the exit, with an option to maneuver toward it.\n2. Given the blocked path represented by the walls in row 9, the avatar can either move left or explore potential interactions with boxes to possibly clear the path.\n\n### Proposed Move:\nSince the avatar's position is near the exit but there are walls in between, the logical first step is to directly adjust the avatar's position towards the left to see what is possible in that direction. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move will enable the avatar to reposition itself and reassess the surrounding layout. My expectation is that moving left will lead to further opportunities to navigate through the level and could potentially clear a path toward the exit."
