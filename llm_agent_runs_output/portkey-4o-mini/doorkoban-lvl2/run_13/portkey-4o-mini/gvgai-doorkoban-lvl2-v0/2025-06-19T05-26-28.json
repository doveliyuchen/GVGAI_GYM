The avatar can push the box to unlock further movement in subsequent turns.\n\n### Action Decision:\nMoving left (to (9, 8)) to push the box seems to be a productive initial action as it will allow further interactions and eventually aim for the exit.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis should facilitate movement and begin the next phase of interaction as strategized.

To progress toward manipulating boxes and eventually reaching the exit, I need to analyze the current setup.\n\nNearby, I can see:\n- To my left (at (11, 7)): a wall (w).\n- To my right (at (11, 9)): an empty space (.).\n- Moving up, at (10, 8): an empty space (.).\n- Moving down, at (12, 8): a wall (w).\n\nHere's a quick summary of what's important:\n1. I can either move right to (11, 9) or up to (10, 8).\n2. Moving to (11, 9) would open up the upper row to continue exploring.\n3. Moving to (10, 8) could also lead to further space exploration, but I notice there\u2019s a door (d) at (10, 3) that might be linked closely to completing the level.\n\nGiven that I need to explore and facilitate the movement of the box identified nearby (specifically the one at (6, 2) as it can interact with one of the holes), I will choose to move up since it may help to get to the boxes eventually.\n\nExecuting my action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up will help me to possibly explore more options as I navigate toward the boxes and interact with holes efficiently. I expect to either find more ways to move boxes or access the exit area."
