Since I have no immediate scoring opportunities, my best course of action appears to be positioning my avatar to make a more impactful next move. \n\nSince my avatar's position at (11, 8) does not help advance the state towards scoring in the next few turns, I should consider the direction that leads to an optimal pathway.\n\nGiven that movement towards holes and the exit has higher significance, I will focus on repositioning my character to optimize future moves. \n\nThus, I will:\n- Move **Left** to (11, 7), to potentially navigate around to (11, 6), or (10, 6) in the next action, keeping in mind the goal to push boxes into holes and subsequently reach an exit.\n\nTherefore, I choose to act as follows:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action allows repositioning while keeping options open for future moves and aligns with the strategy of careful positioning to optimize outcomes for scoring."

It may either push the box or move towards an empty space, to plan subsequent actions.\n\nSince the initial action will be to find a way to adjust the position or interact with the box, I will move downwards to (11, 8), which provides an immediate next step to evaluate further actions.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action should move the avatar down to (11, 8), allowing a clearer path to analyze the possible next moves.
