The nearest goal ('@') is located at (2, 7), which is significantly further above and to the left from the avatar's current position.\n\n2. **Box Management:** There is a box ('b') located at (6, 10), below and one column to the right from the avatar. It may be useful to push or move this box towards the goal or to create advantageous arrangements for other future interactions.\n\n3. **Hole Caution:** A hole ('#') is located at (7, 7), just above and to the left of the starting point of the box that I just mentioned. Navigating carelessly could lead to loss of points or elimination of the avatar.\n\nThe next step is potentially to move left towards the box or upwards to explore further or navigate towards goals.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will take the action to move left from (8, 3) to (8, 2).\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect moving left to allow me to explore further and potentially prepare to interact with the box or navigate towards the goal area without immediate danger of falling into the hole."

Moving south (ACTION_DOWN) to (row=9, col=2) is not viable as it's a wall.
