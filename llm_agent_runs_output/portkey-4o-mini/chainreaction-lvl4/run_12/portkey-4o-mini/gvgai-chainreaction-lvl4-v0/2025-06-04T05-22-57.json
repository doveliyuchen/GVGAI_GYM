The goal location is marked by '@', but in the current layout, there is no explicit goal visible.\n\nThe upper gameplay strategy involves moving toward the goal while avoiding hazards such as holes. The avatar's next possible moves are restricted by the walls '&' and holes '#'.\n\nIn this layout:\n- Moving LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN could potentially allow the avatar to interact with the boulder (2, 11) or reposition itself. However, since 'up' and 'left' move the avatar directly into walls or holes, we focus on available paths.\n\nGiven that the avatar's most immediate objective should be to navigate either toward the boulder, utilize the box ('b'), or find a new pathway, it's essential to maximize movement without redundancy. \n\nThus it would be prudent to take an action that keeps the avatar advancing:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will attempt to move the avatar to the right.
