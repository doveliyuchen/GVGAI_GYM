    "content": "To summarize the current game state:\n\n- The avatar (`a`) is positioned at (8, 6).\n- The environment consists of walls (`&`), empty spaces (`.`), a goal (`@`) located at (2, 7), boulders (`%`) located at (2, 11), a master boulder (`$`) at (4, 11), a hole (`#`) at (7, 7), and box (`b`) at (6, 9).\n- The objective is to eliminate all target boulders while avoiding the holes and reaching the goal.\n\nGiven the layout, I need to determine the best action. The current position of the avatar is safe as it is three rows away from the hole and I can reposition the avatar to interact with other sprites. Since the main goal is to manipulate objects such as boulders and push boxes, I will first move downwards to row 9 to explore more options:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move down to row 9, allowing for more movement options in the subsequent turns. I will evaluate the layout once more after this action to continue optimizing my strategy."

The places of interest nearby include:\n\n- Above (7, 6): Hole (detrimental)\n- Below (9, 6): Wall (impenetrable)\n- Left (8, 5): Empty (floor)\n- Right (8, 7): Empty (floor)\n\nIn this situation, the only viable moves are to the left (8, 5) or right (8, 7). Moving up or down is not an option due to the presence of a hole and a wall respectively.\n\nGiven the strategy suggestions:\n\n1. You should avoid the hole at (7, 6).\n2. Moving towards (8, 5) or (8, 7) keeps the avatar safe and allows further exploration of the grid.\n\nI will choose to move right to (8, 7).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action strategically continues probing open spaces while avoiding hazards, allowing for further exploration of pathways towards goals or other sprites."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, my avatar is located at (8, 7), and the goal is at (2, 7). The level contains walls, boxes, normal boulders, and a master boulder. \n\nCurrently, the only important interaction I see is that I need to navigate upwards towards the goal while avoiding the hole at (7, 7), as staying too close to it may lead to a score penalty. The action to move upwards is immediately necessary, since the avatar's position has not changed yet. Thus, I will take the action to move UP.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will allow me to close the distance to the goal, which is a key part of my winning strategy."
