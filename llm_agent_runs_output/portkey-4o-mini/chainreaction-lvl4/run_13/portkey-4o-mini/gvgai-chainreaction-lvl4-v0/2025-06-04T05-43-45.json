The action to move towards the goal while avoiding pitfalls is paramount.\n\n### Strategy\n1. The best move initially appears to be towards the left (col=2) or downwards (row=8) since the rightward move (col=4) leads to a hole (col=7). \n2. If moving left leads the avatar away from the goal, a downward move to (row=8, col=3) keeps options open since all surrounding spaces are clear except for a wall in the row below at (row=8, col=3).\n\nGiven that the goal is two rows above, moving down will let the avatar explore the trampoline back up to the goal while avoiding falling into a hole, tautologically the safest option.\n\n### Action Decision\nI will attempt the action DOWN (move to (row=8, col=3)). \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis will allow me to safely explore further options towards the goal without risking a negative interaction with the holes nearby."
