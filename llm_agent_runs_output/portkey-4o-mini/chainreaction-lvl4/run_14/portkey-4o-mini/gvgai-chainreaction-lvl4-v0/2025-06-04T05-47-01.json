This will allow the avatar to potentially interact with the box in a following turn.\n\nI will take the action to move left towards the box.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this move to be beneficial, as it will get me closer to potentially shifting the box and navigating towards the goal while keeping my avatar safe from hazards."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, the avatar ('a') is located at (8, 7) which is directly above a hole located at (7, 7). The surrounding grid elements provide the following important points:\n\n1. **Adjacent Positions**: The avatar can move left to (8, 6), right to (8, 8), up to (7, 7) (a hole), or down to (9, 7) (a wall).\n2. **Potential Actions**:\n   - Moving **left** to (8, 6) (occupied by 'b', box floor).\n   - Moving **right** to (8, 8) (which is empty).\n   - Moving **up** to (7, 7), which leads to a hole and would result in a penalty.\n   - Moving **down** to (9, 7) is not possible since it's a wall.\n\nGiven that the objective is to navigate the sprites and avoid holes while progressing toward the goal, moving **up** into a hole would result in failure, and moving down is blocked.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nThe most strategic choice is to move **left** to (8, 6) where the box resides. This action keeps the avatar safe from holes while allowing further movements afterwards.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action of moving left allows for further maneuvers towards either removing boxes or navigating around the grid effectively, aligning with the strategy of planning movements carefully."

    "content": "Given the current state provided, your avatar 'a' is located at (8, 6) and surrounded by various sprites. The immediate surroundings of your avatar are as follows:\n\n- Up (7, 6): floor (.)\n- Down (9, 6): wall (&)\n- Left (8, 5): box (b)\n- Right (8, 7): floor (.)\n\nBased on the layout, there is a box to the left and open floor to the right. You cannot move down due to the wall below and can only move either left to the box or right to the open floor.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n1. Moving **left** to the box will allow you to potentially interact with it, but then your movement options may be limited afterward.\n2. Moving **right** will keep you on an open floor, allowing additional movement options next turn.\n\nFollowing the strategic insights, not only is it important to consider interaction but also to keep future movement possibilities open to reach your objectives and avoid negative scoring from holes.\n\nIn this scenario, I recommend moving **right** to the floor.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should align with the strategy of moving towards open space and maximizing future movement options while avoiding immediate interaction with the box that may hinder flexibility."

    "content": "In the current state of the game, your avatar is located at the coordinate (8, 7). There is a box on the floor directly below at (8, 5), and your goal is located at (2, 7). \n\nThe objective is to navigate the level effectively to remove the targetBoulders while maintaining a positive score and avoiding penalties.\n\nGiven the layout:\n- Your avatar can move around the grid but must avoid holes (`0`) and consider the position of obstacles like walls (`&`).\n- The goal (`@`) is also key to achieving points.\n\nTo proceed effectively, let's consider moving your avatar. Since your avatar is able to interact with boxes (`b`) that are present on the grid, pushing or aligning the `b` may help navigate the level further.\n\nYour current options for movement would be:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2, 6)** - would move the avatar left but that doesn't assist in achieving the goal.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2, 8)** - would move the avatar right to an empty space which could lead further pathways.\n3. **ACTION_UP (7, 7)** - would result in moving toward the goal but only adjacent interaction.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (9, 7)** - this direction leads out of bounds considering max rows.\n\nThe most beneficial action seems to be moving **ACTION_UP (7, 7)** towards more strategic positioning next to the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should advance towards the goal strategically, giving a potential avenue to clear sprites as needed while managing score effectively."
