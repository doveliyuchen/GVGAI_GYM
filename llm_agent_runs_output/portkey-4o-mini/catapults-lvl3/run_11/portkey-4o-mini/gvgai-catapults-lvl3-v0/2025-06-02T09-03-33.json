The surrounding environment seems to have water (`*`) blocking certain paths, and walls (`&`) surrounding various areas.\n\nSince the rules indicate that movement may involve rotating first before moving, I'll need to consider which direction I can face and not try to move into hazardous tiles.\n\nLet's analyze the nearest valid action. The avatar is currently at an unspecified position since it doesn't appear to be listed in the current representation of the state. However, I will assume I start near the bottom of the map and will need to work my way upwards avoiding any walls or water.\n\nBased on the layout, an initial movement action I can take is to go **right** (towards column 9). If my current facing is not correctly aligned with the desired direction of movement, first I would need to rotate before taking the step. \n\nSince I can't specify an initial starting position or initial facing direction without more information, I'll choose to take a directional action first towards the right to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action reflects my intention to move right.

The avatar ('a') has not been specified in the map. Therefore, we need to assume where it might be based on the context.\n2. The goal sprite ('#') is located at position (1, 1).\n3. There are water hazards (represented by '*') spreading throughout rows, which can kill the avatar.\n4. There are walls ('&') throughout the map, which would prevent movement in certain directions.\n5. The map suggests various types of floors and interactions indicated by different sprites.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Identify the Avatar's Position**: Since the position of the avatar is crucial, let\u2019s consider potential starting positions based on what is common in similar games. Let\u2019s assume the avatar is initially located at (9, 9) where we also see an '@' (an east-facing floor).\n  \n- **Plan the Route**: The goal is located at (1, 1). The quickest route involves moving up while avoiding walls and hazards. Looking at the spaces around our assumed avatar location at (9, 9), we can determine potential moves.\n\n### Movements Analysis:\n1. **From (9, 9)**:\n   - Moving **up (8, 9)** is valid as it is a safe spot (contains a '*').\n   - Continuing to move up along this column looks favorable since (7, 9) through (1, 9) also holds safe spots towards our goal.\n\nBased on all assessments, let's make the first move:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action represents moving upward to (8, 9), aligning with the strategy of navigating towards the goal while staying away from hazards in front of us."
