Assessing the best course of action is crucial:\n\n1. **Identify the Avatar's Position**: The position of the avatar is critical for deciding the next move. It should be on one of the defined sprite types.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Immediate Surroundings**: Look for potential movements either towards the goal (located at row 1, col 1) or paths that avoid hazards like water.\n\n3. **Determine if Action is Necessary**: If the avatar hasn't moved after the last action, a rotation might have occurred, thus necessitating a repeat direction action.\n\n### Next Steps\nAssuming the avatar's last action resulted in a failure to move (indicating perhaps a rotation) and knowing the goal location (1, 1), the strategy may involve moving the avatar closer to this goal, while considering any immediate hazards or walls.\n\nLet's choose an action to rotate towards the goal and then proceed based on our analysis. If the last action didn\u2019t change the avatar's position, I should evaluate to rotate and try to move towards the goal.\n\nBased on this reasoning and considering we're currently trying to get to the goal, I will issue the action to move `UP` towards the goal:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should rotate the avatar north and ideally move it closer to the goal (1, 1). I expect this aligns with our strategy to navigate towards the goal without intersecting hazards."
