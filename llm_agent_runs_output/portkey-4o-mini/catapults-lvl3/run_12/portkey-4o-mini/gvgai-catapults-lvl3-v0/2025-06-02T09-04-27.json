Navigating around walls and avoiding water (lethal zones).\n2. Figuring out if the avatar is presently on an open floor or requires movement to get closer to the goal.\n\nSince the avatar position is not explicitly indicated, reviewing the available areas is crucial. The goal at (1, 1) can be reached by avoiding the water in the surrounding areas.\n\nHowever, if the avatar has not changed position since the last action (if it was stuck or blocked), we must consider the action that causes rotation without movement, followed by a subsequent action to maneuver closer to success.\n\nTherefore, I will perform an action to attempt to navigate toward the goal while ensuring tactical safety.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar to the right, aiming for strategic advancement without direct confrontation and towards potentially clearer approaches to reach the goal."

The avatar can face any direction but will need to navigate carefully to avoid hazards and walls while moving toward the goal.\n2. The immediate next action should be contested based on whether it might change the avatar's orientation and position in a safe manner. \n\n### Strategy Application:\n- **Current position**:\n  - Facing upwards would move the avatar toward (row=4, col=8) but doesn't help navigate directly towards the goal.\n\nInstead of keeping the avatar in its current position, we shall navigate towards the goal while checking for rotations and wall interactions.\n\n**Next Action**: Since the avatar's position won't effectively change by facing East (col + 1), we'll start by testing a movement upward to see if that can clear our path towards the goal interspersed with obstacles and hazards.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action suggests moving 'UP' towards the position (row=4, col=8).
