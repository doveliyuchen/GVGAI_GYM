The objective is to navigate from the avatar\u2019s current position towards this goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n3. **Hazards**: There are various lethal sprites (water represented by '*') directly and indirectly blocking paths. The water occupies several positions on the map that I need to avoid.\n\n4. **Available Movement Directions**: The actions available are to move left, right, down, or up.\n\n5. **Orientation Management**: Initially, its facing direction is not indicated by a specific sprite behavior, so managing the facing direction will be crucial as actions may change the orientation first and then the position.\n\n6. **Immediate Objective**: Based on the current layout, I should aim to move the avatar strategically to either approach the goal directly or reposition to an area where a subsequent strategic move can be made.\n\nLooking at the map:\n- To the left (5, 7) there's an empty space (i.e., a wall).\n- To the right (5, 9) is a bullet path (indicated by @ which may come with risks).\n- Above (4, 8) is a wall and below (6, 8) is also an occupied space.\n  \nGiven that the left move leads to a wall, a right move might risk getting damaged by bullets. Ultimately moving downwards leads to an empty space.\n\nSince there haven\u2019t been any rotations that moved the avatar, let\u2019s execute the action to move down, as it is the only viable option without hitting a wall or a deadly sprite. \n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis should allow me to explore further downward toward more open spaces, aligning with the strategic suggestion to avoid hazards while moving toward the goal."

The avatar is currently surrounded by multiple hazards like water ('.') and walls ('&'). \n\n1. The goal is located at (1, 1) while the current position of the avatar is not explicitly stated yet, but based on the state description, I will need to check my orientation before taking actions.\n2. Observing the areas surrounding the potential path towards the goal is crucial, especially since water lethal in this context and could lead to a loss if encountered.\n\nFor the move:\n- I will assume I need to check my orientation first before making a decision to move.\n\nLet's execute a left turn to confirm my orientation. Thus, I'll perform my first action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is aimed at changing my alignment and assessing the situation better, adhering to the strategy of managing my orientation wisely. My expectation is to see if my avatar properly rotates and allows for subsequent maneuvering toward the goal."

Based on previous movement understanding, the avatar may start within the bounds of the provided map.\n\n2. **Identifying the Goal**:\n   - The goal (\"#\") is located at (1, 1). The main objective is to reach this position.\n\n3. **Hazards**:\n   - Hazards include water ('.') and walls ('&'). Interaction with these will lead to avatar destruction.\n\n4. **Assessing Movements**:\n   - If I cannot identify the avatar's orientation or position, it requires careful deliberate movement to first face the right direction before making progress towards the goal.\n\n### Movement Decisions\nSince the avatar's current state is uncertain, the ideal first action will aim towards facing towards the general direction of the goal while avoiding immediate hazards:\n\n- **If the avatar is facing any direction**, the best movement is toward the goal's row and column.\n- In case of hazards, I will choose a directional action that does not immediately lead into a wall or water.\n  \nIf our focus is moving closer to (1, 1) and assumptions are made that the goal is upward relative to my current row, the next move will be **ACTION_UP**.\n\n### Selected Action & Feedback\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis upward action should help position the avatar closer to the goal while analyzing the next state following this movement. Expecting to either find a clear path or adjust strategy accordingly."

I need to navigate through the obstacles and hazards to reach there.\n3. **Hazards**: The avatar can be destroyed by entering water ('*') or colliding with walls ('&'). There are also a number of moving objects like 'A', although specific moving scrolls are not visible around the avatar at this time.\n4. **Surrounding Terrain**: The 3x3 surrounding area around the avatar at (5, 8):\n   - (4, 8) -> '*'\n   - (4, 7) -> '%'\n   - (4, 9) -> '*'\n   - (5, 7) -> '.'\n   - (5, 8) -> '@' (current location)\n   - (5, 9) -> '*'\n   - (6, 8) -> '*'\n   - (6, 7) -> '&'\n   - (6, 9) -> '*'\n\nI observe that to the left (5, 7) is a safe spot ('.') which could allow me to either stay safe while I assess the situation or plan subsequent moves.
