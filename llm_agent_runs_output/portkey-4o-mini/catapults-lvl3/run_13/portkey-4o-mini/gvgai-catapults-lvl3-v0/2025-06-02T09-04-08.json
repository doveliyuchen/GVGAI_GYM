Based on the provided map data, we need to look for viable paths leading towards the goal while avoiding water hazards. \n\nFrom the sprite mapping and the state of the game, it appears that the avatar is in a grid of walls and various tiles, with a goal at (1,1). The critical game mechanics also state that any collisions with water (represented by '*') lead to destruction, and the avatar can only interact with the catapult once to gain points.\n\nCurrently, the avatar is positioned at (5,8) on the map (not explicitly stated in your provided information, but inferred from the notation '@'). The initial surrounding tiles are:\n- (5,7): '.'\n- (5,9): '*'\n- (6,8): '&'\n- (4,8): '*'\n- (5,9): '*' (water tile)\n\nSince the objective is to navigate towards (1,1) without hitting water, let's analyze the position:\n- To the left (5,7) is navigable ('.'), so moving left would be a safe option.\n- To the right (5,9) is dangerous as it leads to '*', which means the avatar would be destroyed.\n- Upwards (4,8) is also a water hazard ('*'), leading to destruction as well.\n- Downwards (6,8) is also a wall ('&'), which would prevent movement in that direction.\n\nConsidering the strategy laid out, the best immediate action would be to move left to (5,7). This avoids any water and allows for potential maneuvering for the next moves.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy of avoiding hazards while trying to progress toward the goal. I expect that after moving left, I can analyze my new surroundings for the next move."

    "content": "The avatar is currently at position (5, 8) facing east, near a series of tiles filled with water (indicated by '*') and walls (indicated by '&'). The goal (indicated by '#') is located at position (1, 1).\n\n### Observations:\n1. The immediate surrounding tiles of the avatar at (5, 8):\n   - Up (4, 8): `*` (water)\n   - Down (6, 8): `&` (wall)\n   - Left (5, 7): `.` (empty)\n   - Right (5, 9): `*` (water)\n\n2. The only valid movement option for the avatar currently is to the left (5, 7), which is a safe tile (empty floor).\n\n### Strategy Application:\nTo advance towards the goal while avoiding immediate water tiles and walls, the appropriate action is to move left into the tile (5, 7) from (5, 8). This will keep the avatar safe and allow for further movement options in the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action takes the avatar to a safe location, and I expect to see further options to navigate towards the goal in the next state."
