It appears there are multiple possible avatars around the states indicated by `@` and an environment filled with walls, water, and goals #.\n\nTo optimize my next move:\n- I will attempt to navigate safely towards one of the goal sprites (`#`).\n- The nearest goal is located at (1, 1), but I must ensure I do not navigate into any hazards (water `*`).\n\nConsidering that I might be starting near one of the positions where I see `@`, I'll choose the `ACTION_UP`, which allows for rotation towards the goal while keeping an awareness to avoid the water.\n\nThus, I will execute:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should allow me to reposition towards the goal without hitting a wall or water. I expect that this adheres to our strategy of movement planning while keeping a focused route towards scoring at the goal."
