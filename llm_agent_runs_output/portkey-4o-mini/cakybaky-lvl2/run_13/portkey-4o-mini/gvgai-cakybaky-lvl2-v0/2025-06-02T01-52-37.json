The objective requires collecting the ingredients in a particular order:\n1. Flour (represented by '#'), located at (3, 5).\n2. Milk (represented by '$'), located at (10, 5).\n3. Egg (represented by '%'), located at (2, 22).\n4. Sugar (represented by '&'), located at (6, 4).\n5. Butter (represented by '*'), located at (7, 24).\n6. Cherries (represented by 'c'), located at (11, 23).\n\n### Current Threats\nThere are multiple chefs present as indicated by '@'. The chef is at positions:\n- (1, 3), (1, 4)\n- (2, 14), (2, 15)\n- (5, 8), (5, 9)\n- (6, 8), (6, 9)\n- (8, 23), (8, 24)\n- (9, 23), (9, 24)\n- (11, 1), (11, 2)\n- (12, 1), (12, 2)\n\nThis indicates that we must navigate carefully around them as we collect the ingredients.\n\n### Strategic Move\nStarting off, the highest priority is to collect the flour at (3, 5). The player will need to navigate the walls represented by 't' and avoid the chefs.\n\n#### Proposed Path\nFrom (6, 11) to (3, 5), the most direct path involves moving left to avoid walls and to position for upward movement:\n\n1. Move left to (6, 10).\n2. Move left to (6, 9).\n3. Move left to (6, 8).\n4. Move up to (5, 8) (potentially encountering a chef).\n5. Move up to (4, 8).\n6. Move up to (3, 8).\n7. Move left to (3, 7).\n8. Move left to (3, 6).\n9. Move left to (3, 5) to collect flour.\n\nSince my avatar's position is currently (6, 11) and needs to begin the route, I will execute the first left move:\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\nI expect this action will reposition me towards the left and bring me closer to the ingredient path while also observing the chef's distance."
