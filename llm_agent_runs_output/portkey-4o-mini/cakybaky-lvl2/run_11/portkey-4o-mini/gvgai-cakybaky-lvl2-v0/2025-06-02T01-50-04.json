The nearest flour increment ('#') is located at (row=3, col=5).\n  \n**Chef Position:**\n- The chefs (@) are present at (row=1, col=3) and (row=1, col=4) (above the avatar's current position), as well as (row=2, col=14) and (row=2, col=15). The avatar must avoid approaching these positions directly to not lose points.\n\nBased on the available action choices, I can:\n\n1. Move `LEFT`: (row=6, col=12)\n2. Move `RIGHT`: (row=6, col=14)\n3. Move `UP`: (row=5, col=13)\n4. Move `DOWN`: (row=7, col=13)\n\n**Recommended Action:**\n- Moving `UP` would bring me to (row=5, col=13), which is still available (.) and not near any chef. This move keeps me distanced from the chefs and is a step towards moving vertically closer to the flour (row=3).\n\nExecuting the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move is expected to help in proximity to the needed resources while maintaining distance from the chef."

As per the map, I need to take into account the placement of the chef to avoid collisions.\n\n1. **Current Strategy:** I need to avoid getting too close to the chef and make my way towards the nearest target, which is the flour at (row=3, col=5).\n2. **Next Move:** I will attempt to move to the left (action 1) from (6, 13) to (6, 12), which is an open space.\n\nLet's execute the action now.\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\n\nThe feedback shows that I am avoiding the chef while attempting to gather the first resource.
