Below is an evaluation of important elements near this position:\n\n- **Adjacent Positions**:\n  - Left (Row 7, Col 9): Empty space (.)\n  - Right (Row 7, Col 11): Empty space (.)\n  - Down (Row 8, Col 10): Table (i)\n  - Up (Row 6, Col 10): Empty space (.)\n\n- **Items to be Collected**:\n  - The first resource (Flour) that needs to be collected ('#') is located at Row 3, Column 5.\n  \n- **Chef Positions**:\n  - The chef ('@') is present at Row 4, Col 14 and Row 6, Col 8, and Row 10 and Row 11. \n  - Given their proximity, especially in Row 6 which the avatar could potentially access, caution is necessary to avoid collisions that will reduce points.\n\n### Strategy Decision\nGiven that the players want to collect resources while avoiding the chefs, I must move strategically to first approach the nearest resource (Flour - Row 3, Column 5). The plan is to navigate toward this resource while staying aware of the chef's positions.\n\nTo begin navigating, I'll first try moving left from my current position to see if that opens up a more strategic route.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action moves the avatar left, allowing me to assess new potential paths while being cautious of the chef's movements. I expect to find a more effective route towards collecting the resources."
