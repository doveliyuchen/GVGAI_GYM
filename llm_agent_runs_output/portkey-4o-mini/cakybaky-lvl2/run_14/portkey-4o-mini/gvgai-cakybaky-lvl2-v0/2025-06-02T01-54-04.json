The next resources must be collected in the order of their defined sequence: milk (inc2, '$'), egg (inc3, '%'), sugar (inc4, '&'), butter (inc5, '*'), and cherries (inc6, 'c').\n\nGiven that we can only collect each resource in order and that every resource is located in a specific sequence, we see the chef threatening the player at positions (8, 22) and (9, 22), which are relatively close to our current position, especially considering the overall mechanic of enemy chase in this game.\n\nKeeping in mind that staying away from the chef is critical, we need to find a move. Moving to the left (col=9) or right (col=11) would leave us in potentially safer spaces without encroaching on the chef's area.\n\nThus, moving LEFT to (8, 9) would be a viable action since it's clear, and it also opens new opportunities to further navigate towards the next resources without being too close to the enemy.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this action to be safe while also edging towards gathering resources sequentially."
