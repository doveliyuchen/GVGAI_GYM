Try to navigate the best way toward the boiling water, moving leftward to (2, 6), then potentially to (2, 1) through further navigational adjustments.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action: \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect to reposition toward an area that will open up future navigation possibilities instead of remaining static."

Meanwhile, the area above (at row 8) is also mostly empty.\n\n### Next Best Action\nSince both up and down do not bring any advantage (due to walls), and left and right also do nothing of benefit, I should specify what I can see and understand. I am going to start searching for resources further from my current position.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn this particular state, it appears I cannot make any advantageous movement that leads to scoring due to surroundings.
