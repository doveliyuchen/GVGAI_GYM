Transforming raw pasta into 'pastainplace' by boiling it.\n2. Combining 'pastainplace' with 'sauceinplace' (which we can create by combining tomato and tuna).\n\n### Next Move Decision\nSince the avatar is surrounded predominantly by emptiness and specific items away from its current location, a good strategy is to move towards where we can access either the boiling water first to prepare the pasta, or the pasta itself if we want to prioritize that. \n\nGiven that the most strategic action here is towards the ingredient that can transform into something essential for the recipe, the plan will be:\n\n- Move **UP** towards (7, 6) as it's a valid location with a better potential for next options.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nI expect that moving UP allows me to optimize towards reaching a location that opens pathways further into the map, eventually getting to the boiling water or the raw pasta.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action directs the chef upwards in the search for ingredients essential to win."

The 'key' which helps with progressing might be nearby, but it isn't visible within my limited view right now.\n3. Given the layout, moving in the vertical or horizontal directions might be necessary to reach the boiling water or raw pasta.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the immediate goal is to gather ingredients, my first step should be to navigate towards the boiling water if possible.

Since my avatar is currently positioned far from these items, my first step must be to move closer to significant resources.\n\nGiven the strategy I\u2019ll adopt, the first action will entail moving right towards the next column, as this keeps me moving towards useful items without encountering walls or obstacles. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is strategic because moving right may open up new pathways or allow me to access ingredients needed for creating the 'plateinplace'. I will monitor how the environment adjusts after this action."
