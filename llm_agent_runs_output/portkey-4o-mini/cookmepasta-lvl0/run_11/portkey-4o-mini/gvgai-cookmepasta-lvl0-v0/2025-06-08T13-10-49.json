Create \"plateinplace\" by combining the correct ingredients.\n2. Specifically, we need to create:\n   - **pastainplace** from combining **boiling water ('@')** and **raw pasta ('#')**.\n   - **sauceinplace** likely from combining **tuna ('%')** and some other ingredient (likely tomato, which is not currently visible).\n\nCurrently, my avatar is positioned near a tuna, which could be used for a sauce.

Since I cannot reach boiling water directly without hitting multiple walls, I will first focus on moving towards the raw pasta.\n\n### Planned Action\nTo reach the raw pasta at (row=2, col=9) from my current position (row=9, col=11), I need to trace a path up and to the left. \n\n1. Move **UP** to (row=8, col=11).\n2. Move **UP** to (row=7, col=11).\n3. Move **UP** to (row=6, col=11).\n4. Move **UP** to (row=5, col=11).\n5. Move **UP** to (row=4, col=11).\n6.

This option allows the avatar to remain close to possible ingredient locations while emphasizing exploration of adjacent areas.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nMoving right will keep my position active and open routes for potential ingredient combinations. Let's see what additional resources I can find in subsequent moves."
