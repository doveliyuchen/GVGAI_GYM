However, my current location must be taken into account since, in this game, I may need to move to interact with items effectively.\n\n2. **Collecting Resources:** Since I don\u2019t see a key within immediate reach and my goal is to make a dish first, I should prioritize interacting with the tomato to see if that leads to a successful dish.\n\n3. **Spatial Awareness:** As my avatar's position is at row 4, column 11, I have sufficient space to access the tomato to my right.\n\nThus, my best move right now is to **move right** to collect the tomato, setting me up for a potential combination of ingredients.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action should allow me to create an effective pathway for dish creation while also being cautious of interaction limits."
