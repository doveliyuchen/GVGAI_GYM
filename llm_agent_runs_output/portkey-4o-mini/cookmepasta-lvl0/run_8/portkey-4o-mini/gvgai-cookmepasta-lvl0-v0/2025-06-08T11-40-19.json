The goal is to prepare a dish by correctly combining ingredients, while also avoiding combinations that lead to a loss condition.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The avatar is on boiling water, positioned adjacent to the raw pasta at (3, 3), the tomato at (3, 10), and the tuna at (7, 11).\n- Our current avatar lies directly on a sprite that can be interacted with, but we first need to ensure our movements align with the strategy laid out before.\n\n### Action:\n1. As the avatar is on boiling water ('@'), we can utilize the boiling water to transform raw pasta ('#') into pasta in place ('pastainplace'). \n2. The next step based on the sprite mapping shows that moving left from the boiling water does not lead to a valid interaction here, we need to utilize the boiling water's position by gathering more resources or preparing effective combinations.\n\nThe closest logical next move would be to try moving down to (10, 2) to explore more of the floor, but actually, this would lead us closer to a wall with no benefit at this point. A better choice would be to rotate towards the necessary interactions.\n\nFor clarity and effectiveness, let's attempt to **rotate downward** first to have a clear view in the next action.\n\n### Next Action:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action aims to direct our attention downward, potentially opening routes without changing our current position, and will allow us to plan effectively for the next move toward combining the right ingredients.
