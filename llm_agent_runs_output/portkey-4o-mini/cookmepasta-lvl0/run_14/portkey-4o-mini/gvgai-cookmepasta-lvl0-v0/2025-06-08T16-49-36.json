However, there is no `boilingwater` available directly adjacent to (9, 11). The avatar can only move left, down, or up. \n\n### Possible Directions:\n- **Left (9, 10)**: This is an empty floor (.), which means no items and hence no advantage.\n- **Down (10, 11)**: This is a wall (&) and cannot be traversed.\n- **Up (8, 11)**: This is also a wall (&) and cannot be traversed.\n\nGiven that moving left does not yield any ingredients or cooking opportunities, while the other actions are blocked, the best course of action is to try moving left to at least reposition the avatar since there could be subsequent movement options available or a future strategy involving other ingredients.\n\n### Action Decision:\nTaking the strategic approach into account, the decision will be to move the avatar left to explore the open floor which might yield new interaction or movement possibilities subsequently.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action reflects a calculating strategy to reposition the avatar away from being stagnant while assessing other nearby resources on the next turn."

You might want to ensure you can combine the tuna with something else, but currently, there appears to be no raw pasta or boiling water in range.\n2. Since you're adjacent to the tuna, you can pick it up with the correct actions if you find a way to create the dish.\n\nThe nearby positions are:\n- To the left (9,10): empty (`.`)\n- To the right (9,12): tuna (`%`)\n- Up (8,11): empty (`.`)\n- Down (10,11): empty (`.`)\n\n**Next Action Decision:**\nSince moving right would allow you to collect tuna and there are no obstacles or walls in that direction:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to gather the tuna and keep progressing towards creating a meal.

Moving left will allow the avatar to combine the tuna effective for the receiving dish strategy.\n\nI'll take the action to move left towards the tuna.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis move should collect the tuna, aligning with the strategy of gathering necessary ingredients to move towards completing the plate of pasta."

The goal is to create a plate of pasta ('*'), while avoiding any wrong combinations that would lead to penalties.\n\n### Evaluation of Current Position:\n- The avatar is next to a wall on the left and below.\n- The tuna is directly to the right of the avatar (9, 12). \n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Collecting Tuna**: Moving right to (9, 11) will allow the avatar to interact with the tuna located at (9, 12).\n2. **Assessing Wrong Combinations**: Since there\u2019s no boiling water or pasta in the immediate vicinity, this action should be considered primarily for resource collection.\n\nBased on the strategic advice given:\n- The player needs to gather ingredients correctly and avoid penalties.\n- Since moving right potentially allows the avatar to collect the tuna for further recipes, this action aligns with our objective to create dishes.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is aimed at collecting the tuna, which is deemed essential for creating a successful dish. I expect that this will guide me one step closer to assembling my plate of pasta."
