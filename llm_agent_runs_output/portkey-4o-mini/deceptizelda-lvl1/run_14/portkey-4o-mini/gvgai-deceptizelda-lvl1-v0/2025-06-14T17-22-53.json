The avatar's current position is not provided, but the map indicates that there are various elements that I can interact with, such as keys, goals, enemies, and vases.\n\nSince there is an important mechanic about verifying if my position has changed after an action, I should first check my possible movements. The immediate areas of interest based on the map are:\n\n- Positions with small goals (indicated by '&') and large goals (indicated by '#').\n- Positions with keys (indicated by '@').\n- Enemy positions (indicated by different monster types).\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. The small goal '&' is located at (10, 11).\n2. The key '@' is located at (10, 10).\n3. The large goal '#' is located at (12, 6).\n4. I see multiple enemy types on the board too, which may impact strategies if I need to fight.\n\n#### Objective:\nSince gathering keys is a priority for accessing more goals, moving toward the key at (10, 10) should be the best immediate move if I am currently near that position. Thus, my first action will focus on either moving to that position or using the key if I happen to be close to it already.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo maximize my score potential and open up further pathways, I will proceed with the action to **move right** to potentially access the key.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should bring me closer to the key '@' at (10, 10), and aligning with my strategy to manage keys effectively.

The avatar's position is critical for determining the next action, but the avatar's current position wasn't specified in the last response.
