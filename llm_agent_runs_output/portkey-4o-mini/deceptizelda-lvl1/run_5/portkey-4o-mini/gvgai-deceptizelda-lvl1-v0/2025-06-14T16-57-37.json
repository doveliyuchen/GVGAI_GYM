I also see a large goal at (12, 6) which is represented by '#'.\n2. **Enemies**: \n   - There are enemies like '$' and monsters that can hurt my avatar. \n3. **Keys**: \n   - There is a key at (10, 10) which is represented by '@'.\n  \n### Conclusion:\nGiven the objective of collecting keys to unlock large goals, the priority is to get to the key at (10, 10). This will enable my avatar to transition to the `withkey` state.\n\n### Action:\nThe best action to move towards the key is moving right to (10, 10).\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to align with the strategy of key collection, subsequently allowing access to goals once I obtain the key."

Here are some relevant observations:\n\n- Directly above the avatar at (9, 10) is a wall (`w`), so movement up is blocked.\n- Directly below the avatar at (11, 10) is also a wall (`w`), blocking down movement.\n- To the left at (10, 9), there is an empty space (`.`), allowing for leftward movement.\n- To the right at (10, 11) is a small goal (`&`), which can be beneficial for scoring points.\n\nGiven that I need to change my action based on the avatar's position not changing last time, I should prioritize moving towards the goal located to the right (10, 11). \n\nI choose to move right:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to make progress towards achieving one of the game's goals, which aligns well with the strategy of goal completion for scoring points."
