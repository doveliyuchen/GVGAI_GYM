    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I observe that my avatar (represented by 'a') is not indicated in the map description provided. However, the items revealed in the description present various opportunities.\n\nBased on the state of the map, my analysis shows:\n\n- At (10, 10), there is a collectible key ('c'), which is beneficial.\n- At (10, 11), there is a small goal ('d'), which is also beneficial to achieve.\n- At (12, 6), there is a large goal ('#'), which provides big scoring opportunities.\n\nThe strategic priorities based on the ongoing strategy are to collect keys and unlock goals.\n\nConsidering my possible actions, I will move towards the collectible key at (10, 10), which should assist in progressing towards unlocking future goals.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis will put me in position to collect the key on my next turn, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing goal completion. I expect that this will correctly utilize the action mechanics and allow me to progress effectively."
