Breaking these could potentially open paths or provide points.\n- The avatar has arrows available to interact with barrels.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Since the avatar is at (18, 22) and needs to move closer to the goal, either navigating upwards and to the left or using arrows to interact with nearby barrels would be ideal.\n- Given the immediate surrounding obstacles and the need to manipulate barrels, I should consider using an arrow to break one of the barrels.\n\n### Planned Action:\nI will direct the avatar to shoot an arrow. Shooting towards the breakable barrel at (2, 15) seems advantageous as it could open paths for moving upwards.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to potentially clear obstacles and provide more movement options in subsequent turns, aligning with our strategy of managing barrels and maximizing pathways to the goal."
