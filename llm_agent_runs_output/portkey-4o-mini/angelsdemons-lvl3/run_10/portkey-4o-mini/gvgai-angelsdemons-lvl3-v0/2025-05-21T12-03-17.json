Currently, we have:\n- **Blessed Characters**: None around.\n- **Citizen Characters**: There's a citizen at (12, 5), (12, 12), (12, 18), (12, 19), and (12, 25).\n\n### Available Actions\n- Moving **Up, Left, or Right** could potentially bring the avatar closer to citizens. **Moving Down is not an option due to the wall.**\n\n### Strategy Alignment\nGiven the puzzle-adventure genre, our goal is to navigate the environment effectively to manage transformations. Thus, I will:\n1. **Move Left** to the citizen at (12, 5). This movement will position the avatar next to a citizen, allowing future interactions to transform the citizen into a blessed character, minimizing risks of cursed transformations.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis and the strategic goal of transforming a citizen into a blessed character, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to approach the citizen, creating opportunities to manage sprite interactions effectively."

The immediate area includes multiple citizens represented by '%', as well as an 'i' input sky directly to the right at (12, 31). \n\nSince the 'i' represents an input sky, interacting with this might allow for the introduction of new sprites or mechanics which can be beneficial for my strategy of transforming citizens into blessed sprites while avoiding cursed transformations. Additionally, my avatar is not currently facing a wall, and there are opportunities for movement without creating a blocking scenario.\n\nTo ensure progress toward the win condition by converting citizens while maintaining their safety, I will move my avatar to position (12, 2) next.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this action to allow me to interact with the citizens directly while also keeping an eye on their transformations and the overall game dynamics."

The surrounding state includes several citizens ('%') nearby, which can be transformed into either blessed characters or cursed characters depending on the interactions we facilitate.\n\nCurrently, there are bolting threats ('w', '&' etc.) and potential opportunities for promoting blessed statuses among the citizens. The overall strategy indicates a need to prevent the transformation of citizens into cursed states, while also aiming to convert them into blessed states.\n\nGiven that my avatar's position hasn't changed from the last recorded state, I need to take action that helps facilitate either moving closer to a valuable sprite or adjusting the position to avoid threats.\n\nSince my next possible immediate actions are directional movements, I will choose to move my avatar left to (12, 1) to position myself closer to other active citizen sprites for potential engagement.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will position me closer to a group of citizens for engagement, which aligns with the strategy of promoting blessed transformations."
