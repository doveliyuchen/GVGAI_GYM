To successfully navigate to victory, you need to focus on ensuring more citizens reach the output while avoiding interactions that could transform them into cursed sprites.\n\nThe following objectives need to be met:\n1. Move citizens to the output at (12, 0).\n2. Avoid having more than one cursed sprite active at any point.\n\nCurrently, the surrounding area consists of sprites that might provide opportunities. Notably, there are blessed citizens (represented by '%') directly reachable, and options for transformation exist as well, potentially with the angel sprites ('@') located nearby.\n\nTo make the most effective move considering your avatar's position, I will select the action that brings me closer to a citizen to interact with or to a safer position. \n\nGiven that the objective is to create a safe passage, the most relevant action is to move downwards to (13, 6).\n\nHence, I will proceed with:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will take me down one unit, allowing me to potentially interact with nearby sprites or shift my strategy accordingly. I expect to assess the new state more effectively after this move."
