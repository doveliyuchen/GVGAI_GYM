Interacting with the citizen will help in transferring them towards salvation.\n2. **Right (to row=12, col=4)**: This spaces it to an empty square, with no immediate interactions.\n3. **Up (to row=11, col=3)**: This also leads to an empty space and no interaction.\n4. **Down (to row=13, col=3)**: Moving down would also lead to a space full with walls, preventing further interaction or progress.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\nThe primary goal is to transform citizens into a blessed state while managing their interactions carefully, particularly avoiding cursed sprites. Moving left to (row=12, col=2) allows immediate interaction with a citizen, potentially converting them into a blessed state on the next directive, which is aligned with the strategy of prioritizing blessed transformation.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the analysis, the best course of action for the avatar is to move left to interact with the citizen.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to engage with the citizen ensures we focus on our objective of maintaining the grid's control and transforming citizens while avoiding further risks associated with cursed sprites."
