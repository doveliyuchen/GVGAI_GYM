The immediate goal should be to direct them toward the output as quickly as possible, which aligns with the maximize point strategy.\n2. **Movement to Output:** The avatar should move either up or down to further interact with the citizens or gain a better position to maximize the interaction with them.\n\nGiven that the avatar position hasn't changed since the last action, I can also confirm that the previous action most likely was not a move, but a rotation.
