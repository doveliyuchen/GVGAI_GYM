Since the avatar's position hasn't changed, it's essential to make gradual moves while ensuring safety from rolling barrels.\n2. The most efficient and safest immediate move is to advance left (to (10, 48)) as it seems to be more open in that direction and offers a potential path upward around the barrels.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left seems the best step to safely advance towards the goal while avoiding obstacles.

The objective is to navigate to the goal ('#'), which is at (1, 10), while avoiding obstacles such as barrels and walls. \n\nLooking at the surroundings, it is crucial to ensure that movement is done safely and strategically. The only direct vertical destination upwards from the current position (10, 32) would be to go up (to (9, 32)). However, in order to evaluate if the avatar can move in that direction, I should first check whether there are any walls or obstacles in position (9, 32).\n\nAccording to the map, the position (9, 32) contains '%', which represents a wall. Therefore, moving up is not possible due to the wall's presence.\n\nNext, I can evaluate moving left or right. \n- Moving left (to (10, 31)) seems possible as it leads to an open space. \n- Moving right (to (10, 33)) is also possible as it leads to an open space as well.\n\nChoosing to move left to (10, 31) will allow progress along the same row. This move does not put my avatar in danger as there are no immediate threats of rolling barrels or walls in this position.\n\nI will proceed with the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action seems sound as it avoids walls and potential barrel collisions, aligning with the strategic suggestion to always have an escape route.
