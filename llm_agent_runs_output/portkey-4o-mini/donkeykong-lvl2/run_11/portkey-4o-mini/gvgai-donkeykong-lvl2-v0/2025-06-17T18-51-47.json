This means movement is limited to the available spaces; therefore, a left move to (10, 48) may result in a blocked move or bring interaction with walls or other sprites.\n2. **Wall Consideration**: The columns to the left (10, 48 onwards) are unavailable; (10, 48) is a wall representing an immovable sprite (%).\n3. **Navigational Passages**: There are empty columns on the right up to (10, 58) and potential progress upwards.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the analysis and since the avatar could not progress left due to the wall, an appropriate action would be to move **up** from (10, 49) to (9, 49). This move could potentially open up new routes within the game strategy towards reaching the exit or deal with any interactable barrels or sprites.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nMoving up provides an opportunity to explore a different area, hoping to find an outlet toward the goal while remaining efficient in navigating the existing challenges presented by the obstacles around the avatar."

To navigate through these obstacles, it might be efficient to first shoot an arrow at one of the breakable barrels (*) located at (2, 34). Doing so could potentially create a pathway for future movements, as well as clear the immediate obstacles.\n\nSince the action of shooting is likely required to make any significant changes in the environment, I will proceed to shoot an arrow at the breakable barrel at (2, 34).\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThe expected outcome is to create an opening by destroying the breakable barrel without encountering any hazards.

Given that the goal is to reach the green exit door (located at (1, 10)), I will assess the possible actions.\n\n1. The avatar can shoot arrows, which could potentially be used to eliminate breakable barrels.\n2. The avatar has the option to move left, right, up, or down.\n\nThe immediate surroundings of the avatar (10, 24) are as follows:\n- Directly to the left (10, 23) is empty.\n- Directly to the right (10, 25) is also empty.\n- Directly above (9, 24) is empty.\n- Directly below (11, 24) is empty.\n\nNo immediate walls or obstacles threaten movement in any direction. \n\nConsidering the objective to maximize movement toward the exit:\n- Moving left to (10, 23) allows for one open space without any direct transformation of barrels.\n- Moving right or down does not offer immediate value since they are also empty.\n- Moving up to (9, 24) would also lead to an empty space.\n\nGiven that the state of the avatar does not change with these movements initially, I will choose to move up. However, since I also haven't shot any arrows yet, it's strategic to consider using arrows to clear breakable barrels and create paths:\n\n**Action:** `ACTION_USE` (to shoot an arrow)\n- This action aims to break barrels (if possible) nearby. Specifically, I notice breakable barrels are within distance (e.g., at (2, 16) or (2, 17)), though they are far as well. \n- After assessing the immediate state, the first action of shooting is strategic to possibly change barrels and create pathways.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nThis action should allow for interaction with the barrels, potentially leading to clearer pathways toward the goal."
