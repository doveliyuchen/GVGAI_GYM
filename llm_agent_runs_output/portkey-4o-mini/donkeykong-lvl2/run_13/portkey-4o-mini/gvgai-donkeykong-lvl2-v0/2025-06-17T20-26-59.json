The barrels ($) can be useful to move and break obstacles.\n2. **Identify Actions**: Your avatars can shoot arrows at barrels, move in different directions, or stay still (ACTION_NIL).\n\n### Current Position and Observations\n- You have two avatar sprites left next to each other (10, 41) and (10, 42).\n- The area immediately surrounding you has a mixture of walls and is close to the goal that requires careful navigation.\n- Moving left to (10, 40) or right to (10, 42) or down to (11, 41) would not be productive as these directions either lead to walls or stay within the same row without a change in position.\n\n### Optimal Action Selection\nSince rotating or moving down doesn't change positions and based on the state that no effective move has occurred recently, the strategy will focus on effectively dealing with obstacles while analyzing the space further.\n\nI will select the action to **move LEFT** to (10, 40) to check if this provides any new options, or possibly to prepare to shoot barrels from this position.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis move should allow me to assess the surrounding layout more effectively and see how the obstacles interact from (10, 40).

To do this, the avatar must navigate through the map while strategically managing the breakable barrels and using arrows.\n\n### Potential Actions\nThe viable actions for the avatar currently are to interact with the breakable barrels or to navigate to a different area that provides a better route towards the goal.\n\nGiven the structure of the environment and recognizing the placement of the barrels, my immediate action should be to **use** the breakable barrels since that can help clear a path or may allow for better positioning in future moves.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this action to potentially clear space, allowing the avatar to navigate more effectively towards the goal."
