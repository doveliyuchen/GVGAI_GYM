The next logical action is to **go left** towards (10, 47).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left keeps me on course to approach the goal while keeping open the possibility to interact with any barrels that may complicate the path ahead."

This is not a valid move.\n- **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** would move to (row=10, col=38) which is empty ('.') and allows exploratory movement.\n- **Moving Up (ACTION_UP)** would lead to (row=9, col=37), also an empty space ('.').\n- **Moving Down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (row=11, col=37) is also empty ('.').\n- **Using the arrow (ACTION_USE)** is an option if there are barrels nearby to break, but since there are no viable barrels in our immediate line of sight to break in our current position, it's not currently beneficial.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best action here is to either move upwards or to the right. Moving right could lead us closer to potential barrels and collectibles, whereas moving up could provide open space to navigate further.\n\nI will choose to move **right** to test for further navigable space:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nMoving right is strategically advantageous to avoid the walls and keep options open for progressing toward the goal.

The immediate surroundings contain a variety of walls ('%') and barrels ('@', '*') that could potentially hinder progress.\n\nFollowing the strategy laid out earlier:\n1. The avatar must be cautious of barrels rolling down towards it from above.\n2. The player can interact with breakable barrels for points or as a way to clear a path.\n3. There seems to be a clear path along column 10 towards the goal, but there are numerous walls and possible barrel traps.\n\nSince the last position was (10, 37) and no movement has occurred, a rightward movement seems suitable since there are a few spaces available that could become useful, and it doesn't initiate a collision with walls or barrels.\n\nThus, I will move right to (10, 38).\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should keep the avatar progressing towards the goal while exploring a potentially clearer area, aligning with the strategy of avoiding rolling barrels and progressing towards objectives."

Below the avatar, there is a tough barrel represented by '*', and further below are various obstacles and interactive elements. The goal '$' is located at (1, 10).\n\nSince we aim to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles, and it seems the avatar's position hasn\u2019t changed yet, I need to take an action different from the last executed one. \n\nI can either break barrels or navigate around barriers. Therefore, a smart move would be to interact with the arrows at (10, 8) as they can help break a barrel and clear a safe path.\n\nLet's execute the action to use the interactable arrow:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis should break any nearby barrels and potentially clear the path towards the goal, aligning with our strategy of maximizing points and minimizing immediate threats from barrels."

    "content": "To analyze the current state based on the provided map, it appears that my avatar ('a') is located at row 10, column 37. The immediate goal is to reach the goal sprite ('$'), which is located at row 1, column 10.\n\nGiven the map layout, here are some important details:\n- The walls ('%') create barriers that will block my movements.\n- Breakable barrels ('@') are located at various positions, which I can aim for to potentially gain points.\n- There's an apparent need to navigate around rolling barrels and walls to reach the goal.\n\n### Analytical Steps:\n1. **Current Position:** My avatar is at (10, 37).\n2. **Target Position:** The goal is at (1, 10), but it's necessary to avoid walls and barrels.\n3. **Obstacles:** There are quite a few walls and some barrels to navigate around; staying aware while planning my path is essential.\n\n### Immediate Actions:\n1. The most direct way towards the goal involves moving upwards (north) several tiles while navigating to the left. Given that my current position is quite far from the goal, I need to adjust my path to avoid obstacles.\n2. I need to rotate my avatar to move directly left or up, depending on what appears next in my path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince I need to make a meaningful action that isn't a rotation and aims me towards the objective while avoiding obstacles, my first action will be to move down (as a preparation step). After considering the possible blockages and the need to move strategically towards the left and up:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis indicates that I'm preparing to analyze the area further from a lower perspective, anticipating potential openings for upcoming moves. I expect this action to reveal more of the map toward an optimal leftward route toward the goal!"
