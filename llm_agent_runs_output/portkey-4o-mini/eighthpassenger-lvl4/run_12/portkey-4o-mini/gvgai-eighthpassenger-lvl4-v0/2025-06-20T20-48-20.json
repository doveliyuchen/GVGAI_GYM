Moving down could result in being engaged by the enemy, which is against stealth and survival strategy.\n2. **Next Move Options:** Moving left to (4, 13) or right to (4, 15) keeps the avatar safe from the alien. Either option maintains the current vertical position, ensuring evasion.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nTo maintain safety and evade the alien, I should move either left or right. I will choose to move left as it allows me to explore areas which might facilitate interactions with doors or access new paths.\n\n### Action Selection\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to (4, 13) keeps the avatar away from immediate danger while exploring the environment, aligning with the core strategy of stealth and evasion."

Currently, I am surrounded by open spaces, but there are also tunnels (specifically down at (4, 3) and up at (5, 3)).\n\nAs a strategic move:\n1. I will analyze the enemies\u2019 locations\u2014there is one pursuer (%) located at (8, 14). It is critical to keep a safe distance from this enemy while also planning my exit route.\n2.

There is a door '#' at (1, 5) which can be interacted with for points.\n\n2. **Strategy**: According to previously discussed strategies, opening doors increases score, and moving towards the exit ($) is the ultimate goal. However, as the area directly around the avatar has limited directions due to walls, the most logical action is to move to an allowable position that keeps options open.\n\n3. **Next Move Calculation**:\n   - Since moving left (Action 1) or down (Action 3) are both blocked by walls, I cannot choose these.\n   - Moving right (Action 2) will keep me in the same row, where there seem to be several open paths ahead that could lead towards a door or towards the exit later.\n   - Moving up (Action 4) from the current position might expose me to the threat of the pursuing alien tunnels and thus isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nGiven these conditions, I'll proceed with the only viable direction for movement which is right. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should allow me to explore further and open up more opportunities towards reaching the exit while avoiding any potential immediate threats."
