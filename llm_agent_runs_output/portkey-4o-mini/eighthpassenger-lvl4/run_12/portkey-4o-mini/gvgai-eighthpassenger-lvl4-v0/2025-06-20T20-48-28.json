There are enemy aliens '@' present in several nearby rows (specifically at rows 6, 7, 8, and 9).\n\n### Analyzing the Environment:\n1. **Avatar Location**: The avatar is at (4, 14).\n2. **Nearby Enemies**: Aliens are at (6, 8), (7, 8), and (9, 8). If the avatar moves in a straight line towards the exit at (12, 24), it would encounter enemies.\n3. **Important Objects**: There are doors '#' on (1, 5) and (2, 23) that can be accessed if switches are used at (9, 3).\n4. **Goal**: The exit is located at (12, 24).\n\n### Strategy Refinement:\nGiven the proximity of the aliens and the layout, avoiding the lower rows where the aliens are positioned is crucial. As such, it would be wise to explore other directions first and not move downward into higher risk areas.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- Up (to (3, 14)): May offer a safer route away from enemies.\n- Left (to (4, 13)): Not advisable since there are walls.\n- Right (to (4, 15)): Opens up potential paths but could also be a risk given the number of aliens in adjacent rows.\n- Down (to (5, 14)): Moves into another row with potential threats.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nThe safest option at this moment is to move **up to** (3, 14).\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis will allow me to reassess the situation from (3, 14) and look for new strategic options to avoid confrontation with the aliens while moving toward the exit effectively."

In current surroundings, there are no pursuers nearby.\n3. **Exit Location**: The exit ('$', Row 12, Col 24) is below the current position, suggesting there may be a path downwards.\n\n### Strategy Alignment\nBased on the strategy provided:\n- Engage in initial exploration around the position.\n- Utilize stealth and avoid confrontations since no immediate threats are present.\n- Consider moving down to explore pathways leading to the exit.\n\n### Selected Action\nFrom the current position at Row 4, Col 14, I can explore downwards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action will allow me to continue my exploration while keeping alignment with the strategy of navigating safely towards the exit."

While there are switches present, activating them may require proximity and careful timing to avoid detection.\n\n### Available Actions:\nGiven my current position and the need for strategic movements, moving left (to (4, 13)), right (to (4, 15)), up (to (3, 14)), or down (to (5, 14)) are my options. Moving downwards is more advantageous since it will bring my avatar closer to exit row 12, while ensuring that I'm in a position to utilize tunnels.\n\n**Action Decision**:\nI will move down to (5, 14) as this keeps my movement towards free spaces and potentially closer to the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nI expect to stay out of the pursuers' line of sight, continuing to navigate strategically towards the exit."

The objective is to reach the exit, which is found at (12, 24).\n\n### Current Analysis\n- The avatar is currently **standing** (`&`) at (5, 14).\n- Nearby entities include doors (`#`), tunnels (`d`), and the closest alien sprite (`%`) is at (6, 14).\n- There are also switches (`*`) and a direct path to the exit several rows below.\n\n### Immediate Threat Assessment\nThe alien sprite (`%`) being adjacent in position (6, 14) poses an immediate threat if the avatar moves forward. Thus, remaining stealthy is required.\n\n### Strategic Plan\n1. **Crouching Movement**: To make the most of the available space and avoid detection, we should consider utilizing the crouch option as per the provided strategy.\n2. **Navigating Around Threats**: The best action may not directly progress towards the exit if it means risking detection by the alien.\n3. **Utilizing Tunnels**: The tunnels (`d`) can provide safe travel to navigate around the alien and reach the switch or doors as needed.\n\n### Current Actions\nGiven the position and immediate surroundings, I will:\n- **Crouch to Alter Threat Dynamics**: This minimizes the profile and may reduce visibility to nearby sprites.\n- As my avatar's position and state do not change with only standing, I will next **move down** to reach a tunnel and better navigate towards avoiding proximity to the alien.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action will hopefully lead to a better position while minimizing visibility to the alien, allowing future moves towards the exit."
