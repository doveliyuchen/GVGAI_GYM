However, I need to analyze where those actions will take me.\n   \n2. **Identifying Nearby Entities**:\n   - Moving **Left (4, 13)**: This position is free ('.').\n   - Moving **Right (4, 15)**: This position is also free ('.').\n   - Moving **Up (3, 14)**: This position is also free ('.').\n   - Moving **Down (5, 14)**: This position is also free ('.').\n\n3. **Evaluating Threats and Strategy**:\n   - Moving to any of these positions keeps me one step away from the pursuer at (9, 14). However, the pursuer displays potential movement options towards me, so maintaining distance while advancing towards the exit remains crucial.\n   - Moving **Up** aligns with the strategy of creating more space and exploring towards the maze exit in a tactful manner.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven these considerations and to follow the overall strategy of navigating toward the exit while maintaining distance from enemies, the most strategic move is to go **Up (3, 14)**.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action should align with my goal of advancing towards the exit while evading detection by enemies and maintaining a tactical position."

Avoiding the pursuer located at (row=9, col=14) directly below me.\n2. Closest interacting elements include a switch at (row=9, col=3) that may help me manipulate the maze layout if needed.\n3. The exit is located at (row=12, col=24), which is a goal to aim for.\n\nGiven the context that my position has not changed in the previous step and I'm positioned above a pursuer that is a potential threat, my action should be cautious.

I cannot move UP (to (3, 14)) as it's blocked by a wall ('e').\n2. Moving LEFT (to (4, 13)) or RIGHT (to (4, 15)) doesn\u2019t offer a pathway towards an exit or necessary switches.\n3.
