    "content": "Given the current game state, my avatar (denoted as `&`) is located at (4, 14). The surroundings show several obstacles including walls (`e`), and closed doors (`#`). There are also potential risks like enemy sprites (`%`) located at (9, 14) and moving alien tunnels (`@`) nearby.\n\nSince my primary goal is to navigate through the maze to reach the exit located at (12, 24) and considering my current position, I should carefully plan my next move to avoid enemies while seeking out mechanisms that could help me advance.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n1. **Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: Would move to (4, 13) which is clear. However, there is no clear advantage in this move.\n2. **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: Would move to (4, 15) where there's also a free space. Still, it doesn\u2019t progress towards the exit.\n3. **Down (ACTION_DOWN)**: This would move to (5, 14), which is a horizontal space I can take with no visible threats directly.\n4. **Up (ACTION_UP)**: Would move to (3, 14), which is also a free space, but it doesn\u2019t lead me closer to the exit compared to going down.\n\nAs per my strategy, moving down seems to be the most beneficial option, especially since it opens more pathways below, including potential switches that might facilitate further navigation.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should help me maintain my progress downwards towards further opportunities to navigate towards the exit."

    "content": "Given the current game state, I can see that my avatar (represented as '&') is positioned at (row=4, col=14) and is also next to a switch ('*') located at (row=9, col=3). My primary goal is to navigate the maze, avoiding enemies and aiming to reach the exit ('$', located at row=12, col=24).\n\nSince there are no enemies immediately threatening my current position, I will use the switch located further down in the map to potentially open doors or change the layout of the maze, which can be advantageous later.\n\nHowever, before taking that action, I need to analyze if moving towards the switch would allow me to open it so that I can score points and possibly access a new area quickly. The best path towards the exit without encountering any barriers appears to be down towards the row where the switch is located.\n\n### Next Move\nSince I need to change my state and I am currently standing, I will move down to explore the area and reach the switch, as it is crucial for manipulating the maze's environment.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action to result in movement while keeping in line with the strategy of maximizing interactions with game elements to facilitate progress towards the exit."

There appears to be a pursuer located at (8, 14), and I need to be cautious about movement to avoid getting caught.\n\n### Analyzing the Map:\n- I need to head towards the exit located at (12, 24).\n- The only immediate actions are moving left (5, 13) or right (5, 15). Both options do not lead me closer to the exit while keeping the pursuer's position in mind.\n\n### Recommended Strategy:\n- Since I am currently on a tile with no immediate exits or useful interactions (like switches or doors), I\u2019ll try to stow away from the pursuer. I can choose not to move away from the pursuer while taking my next actions into account.\n\n### Selected Action:\n- I will choose to move down (6, 14). This keeps distance away from the pursuer and allows me to further explore paths toward my exit while navigating carefully.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action seems appropriate as it allows me to strategically position myself further away from the pursuer while opening up new pathways to advance towards the exit."

    "content": "To begin with, I will analyze the current state. The avatar represents the player and is currently located at position `(5, 14)`, where the surrounding tile is clear, labeled as `.`. There are various elements elsewhere on the map including walls, doors, tunnels, enemies, and an exit.\n\nGiven that the goal is to reach the exit located at `(12, 24)` while avoiding enemies, it's important to carefully navigate. Presently, there are some enemy sprites around the maze, notably at `(8, 14)` which poses a threat.\n\n### Suggested Action\nSince the avatar didn't move in the last state, I will choose a direction. The exit is downward, but there are several obstacles. Moving **down** (toward `(6, 14)`) is a safe option, considering the current layout, as it leads towards less crowded areas.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move is logical to start progressing toward the exit while maintaining safety from immediate threats, and I will observe the new layout after executing the action."

The immediate surroundings include walls (e), alien tunnels (@) to the left and below, and a pursuer (%) in row 7, col 14 directly below your current position.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategic analysis based on the state:\n\n1. There's an immediate threat from the pursuer located in row 7, col 14 directly underneath you. Moving down could lead to an unfavorable encounter and potentially result in losing points or the game.\n2. The directions to the left (col 13) and right (col 15) have walls, while above (row 5, col 14) is also a wall.\n3. The only other option is to proceed are downwards (row 7, col 14), which is not advisable due to the pursuer.\n\nSince your position does not change and keeping in mind the immediate threat below, I should execute an action that allows me to avoid the pursuer while maintaining my position.\n\nAction chosen: \n``` \nAction: 0 \n``` \nThis action maintains the current state while assessing for potential movements. It is a strategic choice to ensure the safety of the avatar considering the direct threat below.

An immediate concern is the proximity to a pursuer sprite `%`, which is directly to the south at `(7, 14)`.\n\nTo avoid confrontation with the pursuing enemy, as well as to remain aware of our position, the priority is likely to move left, which will allow us to create distance from the pursuer while also potentially moving towards the exit.\n\nThus, the planned action is:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n \nThis will move the player left to position `(6, 13)`, creating space from the enemy and possibly allowing for a safer strategic assessment in the following turn. Maintaining stealth is essential in this situation."
