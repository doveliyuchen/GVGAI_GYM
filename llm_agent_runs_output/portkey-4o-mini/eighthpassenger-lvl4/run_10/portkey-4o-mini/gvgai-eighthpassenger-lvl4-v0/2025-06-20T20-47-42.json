The actions available are directional movements (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). Given the blockage by walls and potential encounters with enemies, the next effective movement is to check surroundings.\n\nConsidering the current setup, moving **DOWN** seems reasonable to explore the lower rows where opportunities may arise, especially since our current row (4) has some tunnels (denoted by `d`), but a downwards move (to row 5) may reveal more options:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this DOWN action will allow us to explore further down towards possible switches or paths while maintaining situational awareness regarding the enemies."

The immediate goal is to navigate towards the exit marked by `$`, located at (12, 24).\n\nLooking around:\n- The left side (4, 13) is clear.\n- The up direction (3, 14) is also where there are additional standing tiles.\n- Down (5, 14) is also possible as it contains a standing tile.\n\nGiven the need for maneuvering stealthily to avoid the alien threats present and the goal being towards the exit, it makes sense to move vertically or horizontally where there\u2019s open path to proceed toward the best strategy for approaching the exit.\n\nFor the next move, I will head **down** to (5, 14) where there's standing space and no immediate threat. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action gives me mobility to plan my next moves towards the exit while remaining in a safe position."

There are several objects and variables to consider:\n\n- **Nearby Enemies:** There are aliens to the south (6, 8) and (7, 8). Caution is necessary to avoid being caught by these pursuers.\n- **Pathways and Obstacles:** The map offers a variety of walls (e), tunnels (d), the important switch (* at (9, 3)), and access to the exit ($ at (12, 24)).\n- **Available Movements:** Considering there are corridors leading up, down, left, and right, moving stealthily and strategically is essential.\n\n### Plan of Action\n1. The next move should avoid the aliens and seek access to potential switches or paths towards the exit.\n2. Since crouching is important for stealth, I should also ensure I'm taking actions that allow for stealthy movement without encountering aliens directly.\n\nAs the last action's position was not given, I need to determine the best immediate action from my current position. \n\n### Strategy\nTo maintain stealth while avoiding dangerous areas:\n- **I will choose to move LEFT (2), to (5, 13),** which may give me a better view and potentially lead to an open path while avoiding proximity to the pursuers.\n\nNow, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis left movement enables strategic positioning while considering the surrounding threats.
