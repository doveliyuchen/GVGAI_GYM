Since your avatar has not changed position from the last state, I will consider directions that not only avoid enemies but also allow you to explore more favorable routes.\n2. As there are options to move downward (towards more exits), and considering the layout reveals some accessible paths below without immediate threats, I will opt to move down.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action aims to navigate closer to the exit while maintaining safety from visible enemy threats in the adjacent rows.
