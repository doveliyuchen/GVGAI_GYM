I will take note of my position as represented by the avatar and analyze the surrounding environment for potential actions.\n\nThe avatar's current position is at (4, 14). The immediate surroundings are as follows:\n\n- Up (3, 14): `.` (open space)\n- Down (5, 14): `.` (open space)\n- Left (4, 13): `.` (open space)\n- Right (4, 15): `.` (open space)\n\nI can choose to move in any direction as all seem to have open spaces, enabling me to reposition effectively. However, the goal is to avoid confrontation with pursuing enemies and navigate strategically towards the exit.\n\nConsidering the strategy to prioritize movement while remaining aware of enemy positions and potential exits, I will proceed to move Down (5, 14) to explore further options in the next turn.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to explore the subsequent row while keeping my movements stealthy, aligning with the previously outlined strategy. I expect to see no immediate threats and possibly reveal new pathways towards the exit."

The nearby positions reveal that there are tunnels 'd' which could facilitate movement, as well as opportunities to interact with switches '*'. However, there is also a 'pursuer' '%' at (9, 14) which I need to avoid.\n\nFrom the observation of the map:\n- The exit '$' is located at (12, 24).\n- There are multiple tunnels nearby that may help change states or provide alternatives to navigate easily around enemies.\n  \nSince my avatar is standing still and based on the strategy provided, it is important to engage the environment wisely. I will first try moving downward to the tunnel at (5, 14) to see if it provides a more strategic advantage for evasion or a clearer path towards the exit. \n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis downward movement is intended to take advantage of the available tunnel while keeping away from the pursuer. I expect this move will either bring me closer to an exit path or allow further engagement with the maze's mechanics."

Navigating efficiently through the maze.\n2. Interacting with the environment to avoid enemies while seeking the exit.\n3. It\u2019s important to avoid getting caught by pursuing enemies, and my current strategy emphasizes stealth.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince I am in a good position with multiple open paths and no immediate threats visible in the surrounding cells, I will proceed to move **down**, which could potentially lead me to uncover more space or objectives below.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to reveal more of the maze below and may provide new routes toward the exit while I avoid potential dangers from enemies."

This indicates that I am in a standing state and adjacent to various elements, including open spaces, tunnels, and a pursuing enemy below at (7, 14).\n\nTo navigate effectively:\n\n1. **Aim for safety**: I should avoid moving directly towards the pursuing enemy currently located to the south (below me).\n2. **Consider nearby elements**: There's a tunnel (d) below me at (7, 3) and I can also transition to a human or a wandering state depending on interactions with the environment.\n3. **Evaluate options**: Staying in the presence of a pursuing enemy poses a risk, so I will attempt to move into a direction that either increases distance from the enemy or reaches a safer area.\n\nFollowing these considerations, I will choose to move **down** towards the opening by directly moving to (6, 14) which aligns with my strategy to analyze state and not remain positioned where I could be caught. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should keep me alert to surrounding obstacles while prioritizing both positional safety and potential escape routes from the pursuer."
