Therefore, I choose:\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy of approaching the nearest collectible, allowing for further transformation interactions as needed.

The nearest `j` to where I expect the avatar to be based on surrounding walls seems to be at either (1,19) or (2,19).\n\nTo initiate our interaction, I will move **down**, which is likely clear based on our goals to ensure that we can gather the potatoes effectively.

There is also a 'goal' (`g`) located at row 12, column 21.\n4. The goal is to transform 'potato' sprites into 'potatofull' and reach the goal.\n\n### Strategic Analysis\n- Since there are multiple instances of the 'potato' sprite (`j`), my immediate task should be to move towards one of them.\n- The goal (`g`) is located at (12, 21) and can be reached using the pathways adjacent to it.\n- Based on the available actions, I can either move left or down if I am near the potato to collect it, or interact with other elements accordingly.\n\n### Next Actions\nWithout explicit information indicating my current avatar position but assuming it's probably near one of the 'potato' sprites for optimal strategy consistency:\n\n1. If I am adjacent to a `j` (potato) sprite in row position 5, column 19 (closest to row 12 theoretical goal), I'll use an action to collect it (action for transformation).\n2. Given the nature of directional actions, if the avatar has previously moved and rotated, I should ensure movement towards a `j` sprite without shifting from the previous action.\n\n### Decision\nProceed by collecting a nearby 'potato'. Assuming the avatar is near the potato at row 5, column 19:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is moving down, and my expectation is to collect the 'potato' sprite effectively while advancing towards the goal."
