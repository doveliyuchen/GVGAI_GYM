The avatar's current position is not directly provided, but based on the transformation path mentioned earlier, let's visualize potential interactions:\n\n### Immediate Actions to Consider:\n1. **Engage with Potatoes**: The avatar should move towards the nearest potato to initiate the transformation process.\n2. **Utilize Assembly Areas**: After the first transformation, the avatar needs to utilize assembly areas (1, 2, or 3) strategically to reach the final form (potatofull).\n3. **Observe the Lever Mechanic**: The placement of the lever could significantly change the environment, possibly opening new pathways or clearing obstacles.\n\n### Current Layout Insights:\n- The primary goal (g) is at (12, 21).\n- Potatoes are available, and transformations need to be conducted in assembly areas.\n- The avatar must navigate through walls (b) and other elements carefully.\n\n### Selected Action:\nThe most immediate next action should focus on moving towards the nearest potato for transformation. Assuming the avatar is positioned in row (let's say) 9, a relatively central position considering the potato distribution.\n\nGiven these observations, let\u2019s select the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action signifies moving RIGHT towards a potato in row 9 or further exploring to transform it. By moving towards one of the potatoes, I expect to start the transformation process towards achieving the potatofull state promptly.

Here's a brief rundown of the situation based on the layout:\n\n- You need to reach and transform a potato (represented by 'k') into its final form and get it to the goal 'g'.\n- The nearest potato is located multiple rows away, and the assembly areas (marked by '@', '#', and '$') for transforming the potato are within a reasonable distance but separated by walls (marked by 'b') and other elements.\n\n### Analysis of Actions:\n1. Your avatar is either stuck or unable to make immediate progress due to surrounding walls and the configuration of the level.\n2. The objective requires the use of levers and avoiding unnecessary interactions that could lead to complications or time loss.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\nSince the avatar's movement and interactions with the environment are crucial and the immediate position has not changed, action is required to optimize the movement toward the potato and/or avoid obstacles.\n\nGiven the surroundings, the best course of action is to move DOWN, as this would help in progressing towards the areas with the potatoes and the assembly points while navigating through the level.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar down, moving towards the assembly areas and potatoes, which aligns with the strategy of maximizing interactions to lead towards the ultimate goal in the minimum amount of time."
