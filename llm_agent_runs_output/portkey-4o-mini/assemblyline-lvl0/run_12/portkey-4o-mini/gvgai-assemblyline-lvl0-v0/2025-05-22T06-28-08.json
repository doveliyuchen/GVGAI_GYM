The main task involves transforming the 'potato' into 'potatofull' and delivering it to the goal.\n\nKey observations:\n- There are several potatoes located at (1, 19), (2, 19), (3, 19), (4, 19), (5, 19), (6, 19), (7, 19), (8, 19), (9, 19), (10, 19), (11, 19), and (12, 19).\n- I need to navigate to the closest potato, which is located at (12, 19).\n- There are also assembly spots in the surroundings\u2014I need to utilize them after obtaining the potato.\n\nMy first action should be to move to the potato to collect it.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action moves my avatar right towards (12, 19), allowing me to collect the potato and set up for the next transformation action. I expect this aligns with the strategy of efficiently gathering needed items to continue progressing toward the goal."

The primary goal is to transform the potato into 'potatofull' and deliver it to the goal ('g') at (12, 21).\n\nThe first thing to note is that there are assemblies nearby which should facilitate the transformation of the potato:\n- The assembly1 ('@') at (4, 7), (5, 7), and (6, 7);\n- The assembly2 ('#') at (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 21);\n- The assembly3 ('$') at (10, 21).\n\nTo strategize effectively, we need to move down to pick up the potato. \n\nSince the avatar is currently at (12, 8), moving down to (13, 8) does not contain anything relevant for transformation. Therefore, the first action will be to move to the left and then down to reach the potato. \n\nHere's the proposed action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should rotate the avatar towards the left from (12, 8) to (12, 7). In subsequent moves, we plan to go downwards toward the potato at (19, 19). Given that the initial direction is critical, I expect this maneuver to be a part of our pathway towards obtaining the potato for transformation."

I anticipate that moving right will position me next to the potato and allow for immediate interaction."

I can see I'm positioned at (row=12, col=8), and there are a few things to note in this area:\n\n- At my current position, there is my avatar ('a').\n- The goal ('g') is at (row=12, col=21), and it is important to reach this to win the game.\n- There is a potato ('j') located in my row directly at (row=12, col=19), which might be the object I need to transform into 'potatofull'.\n\nConsidering the strategic approach, my immediate goal is to move toward the potato to interact with it and initiate transformations. The available actions would be to move left to (row=12, col=7) or right to (row=12, col=9).\n\nSince moving right (to (row=12, col=9)) does not lead to reaching the potato, I will choose to move left toward the potato, accessing it for transformation.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis leftward move should aid in getting closer to the potato, allowing me to interact with it next turn. My expectation is that by moving left, I will successfully position myself next to the potato and proceed with an interaction in the next turn."

There are 'potato' sprites at various locations, the nearest being at (1, 19), and the goal is at (12, 21).\n\nSince the strategy indicates that I need to locate items and interact efficiently, my next actionable step is to consider what transformation can be made initially and how to move towards that goal.\n\n### Current Objectives:\n- **Transform the 'potato' located at (1, 19)** to eventually make it into 'potatofull'.\n- **Move towards the goal** at (12, 21) after the transformations.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. I am at (12, 8).\n2. To reach the potato at (1, 19), I will first need to navigate through a series of movements to get closer to the assembly points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe immediate action should focus on moving towards the goal indirectly by planning routes. \n\nSince I am positioned in a row that might allow easy access to the left or right, I will **move to the right** towards (12, 9) where there is an accessible space that can help in navigating upwards towards the potato.\n\nThus, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves my avatar to the right.

The goal ('g') is located at (12, 21), so I will need to progress towards the goal efficiently while managing transformations.\n\nSince the last action was likely moving or interacting, and the avatar hasn't changed position, the next logical action is to use the lever to see how it affects the state of the game.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing the lever might generate some necessary changes or transformations in the environment that can facilitate further movements toward the goal. I expect this action to provide some strategic advantage or open new pathways for the 'potato' transformations."
