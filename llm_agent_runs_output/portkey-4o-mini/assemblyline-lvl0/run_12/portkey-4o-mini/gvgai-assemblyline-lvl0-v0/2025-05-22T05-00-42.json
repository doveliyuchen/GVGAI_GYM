However, there are several transformations that need to occur first to convert the `potato` (located at (1, 19)) into a `potatofull`, and ultimately reach the goal.\n\n### Available Assembly Points\n- To reach the `potatofull` state, the following transformation path is required:\n  1. Take the `potato` at (1, 19) to `assembly1` at (4, 7) to transform them into `potatoeyes`.\n  2. Next, transform `potatoeyes` into `potatoeyesnose` at `assembly2` (which can be at (10, 11), (10, 12) for later).\n  3. Finally, transform `potatoeyesnose` into `potatofull` at `assembly3`, before trying to reach the goal (`g`).\n\n### Current Action Decision\nCurrently, the avatar is surrounded by empty spaces. The best immediate action is to move towards the assembly point at (4, 7) to proceed with transforming the potato.\n\n#### Analysis of Potential Actions:\n1. **Left (4, 3)**: Moves to an empty space, but does not help reach the assembly point.\n2. **Right (4, 5)**: Moves to an empty space, but does not help reach the assembly point.\n3. **Up (3, 4)**: Moves to an empty space, but does not help reach the assembly point.\n4. **Down (5, 4)**: Moves into a vortex, resulting in a loss.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that moving left, right, or up does not approach the assembly point where we need to convert the potato, the optimal action is to move either right or down (however right doesn't move into any hazard). Therefore:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect this action to allow the avatar to move towards closer proximity to the future objectives for transformation."

The most critical task now is to start transforming potatoes. The nearest assembly items appear to be at `(4, 7)` which is `@` (assembly1) that can be used to transform potatoes into `potatoeyes`.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Collect Potatoes**: Move towards one of the nearby potatoes to collect them.\n2. **Transform**: Once I have collected a potato, I need to navigate to an assembly point to begin transformations.\n3. **Progress**: Continue transforming until I reach `potatofull` and eventually toward the goal.\n\n### Action Selection\nSince the specific position of the avatar isn't included, let's assume that moving down to gather resources near one of the potatoes is beneficial. The nearest potato appears to be to the right at `(1, 19)`.\n\nI will take the action to move the avatar `RIGHT` to potentially gather the potato, assuming this is a viable first step.\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\nThis action should help me collect a potato if the avatar can move to that position effectively.

Given the context and the nature of the game, the avatar seems to have been placed in a region where it must interact with layers of components (potatoes, assembly items, etc.).\n\n2. **Nearby Elements**: Looking at the map layout, I see that there are:\n   - Potatoes ('j') scattered throughout the grid, particularly at multiple points (e.g., `(1,19)`, `(2,19)`, `(3,19)`, etc.).\n   - Assembly items at specific coordinates (the '@', '#', and '$' represent different assembly items).\n   - A portal ('w') at `(0,19)`, which could help transport the avatar across the level.\n\n3. **Goals and Strategy**: According to the objectives detailed, I am working towards transforming potatoes through various stages (potato -> potatoeyes -> potatofull) and ultimately reaching the goal sprite ('g'). \n\n4. **Plan of Action**: \n   - If my avatar is at an effective position, I should aim to collect a potato and then interact with an assembly point to start the transformation process. \n   - The next logical step is to move towards a potato, which is abundant in the current visual representation.\n\n5. **Evaluating Actions**: \n   - The best potential action right now would be to collect a potato to begin the transformation process.

The first move should be to either interact with an assembly item or go towards a potato.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven that I need to initiate interaction and potentially gather resources, pursuing the potato nearby or aiming towards the assembly is logical. Taking the available actions into consideration:\n\n1. If the avatar is next to '@', using 'ACTION_USE' would make sense to immediately engage in an assembly.\n2. If the avatar needs to reach the potatoes in row 2, moving 'DOWN' towards them might be a more effective approach.\n\nSince there is no updated information regarding the exact current position of the avatar after a last action, I will proceed with the best strategic action to engage an assembly item:\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \nThis action uses the assembly item near the avatar to transform potatoes, thereby getting closer to the win condition."

However, it seems there are multiple potatoes spread across different rows. \n\nThe closest row above, row 11, has several instances of `j` and potential assembly items right below:\n\n- Row 10 (containing `#` which is an assembly point).\n- Row 11 and Row 12 have `j` in their columns which indicates we can transform these items.\n\n### Location Confirmation\n1. Row 12, column 21 is the goal.\n2. There are multiple adjacent spots with potatoes (`j`) that can be assembled into higher forms through the assembly points (`@`, `#`, `$`).\n3. Given that the mechanism involves transformation of the potatoes, the next logical step is to reach a potato.\n\n### Action Decision\nCurrently, the avatar is on the last row (row 13), and needs to navigate to row 12 or 11 to reach the nearest `j` (potato) while preparing for the assembly.\n\n#### Current Position:\nFrom the provided map details, we do not have the exact avatar position since it was not provided explicitly in the \"current state\" segment, but it seems reasonable to ascertain movement based on adjacency. \n\nTo utilize the down action from the potential current row (row 13, where the avatar could be amidst walls) to navigate into row 12 directly down while confirming that we can access the potatoes.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nBy moving down, the expectation is to get closer to the potatoes for eventual transformation, thereby progressing towards reaching the goal positions efficiently. Since moving down should get more directly to `j`, this aligns with the strategy well."

Several potatoes are present at different rows and positions.\n- The avatar has the option to maneuver around the level to reach an assembly item and begin the transformation.\n\n### Best Action:\nTo take meaningful action, we need to define the starting avatar position and choose a movement toward a potato or assembly item.\n\nIf we assume the avatar is at a convenient position near several 'j's:\n\n- There are potatoes located in:\n  - row 1, column 19\n  - row 2, column 19\n  - row 3, column 19\n  - row 4, column 19\n  - row 5, column 19\n  - row 6, column 19\n  - row 7, column 19\n  - row 8, column 19\n  - row 9, column 19\n  - row 10, column 19\n  - row 11, column 19\n  - row 12, column 19\n\nAssuming the avatar is somewhere near and can easily access these potatoes, the action to collect potatoes would be:\n\n**Collecting Action:**\nAssuming the avatar can directly interact with one of the closest potatoes, we should take a movement action. \n\nLet's move **UP** or **DOWN** towards one of the 'j's, as that is a valid strategy to begin the transformation process.\n\nSince we cannot see the actual location of 'a', I will first assume an action that would likely move toward one of the potatoes immediately:\n\n``` \nAction: 4  # ACTION_DOWN (to move toward the closest potato)\n```\n\nThis assumes the avatar is above row 5. If the position doesn't change as anticipated, we can analyze further based on any rotations or adjustments needed.

Since the avatar is positioned such that it can't directly move right or left due to walls, the immediate direction of interest is **down**.\n2. Moving down will bring the avatar to (13, 21), which is still occupied by wall (`b`) and would not be useful.\n3. The best path towards transforming the nearest potato involves either moving towards it (down) in row 1 or row 3 then taking a left path through an assembly point.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven this assessment, the best action to take is the direction to the nearest available assembly, which seems to be going down to (13, 21) leads where I cannot go. Thus, from (12, 21) I can move *left* to find a potential path:\n\n```Action: 2``` \n\nThis action will attempt to rotate left towards the nearest available path or assembly, expecting to find either an assembly or opportunity to collect a potato from a lower row.
