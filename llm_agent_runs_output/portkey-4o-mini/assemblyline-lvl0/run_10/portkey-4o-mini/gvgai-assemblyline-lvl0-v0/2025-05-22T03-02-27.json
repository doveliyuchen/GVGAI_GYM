However, the adjacent walls and obstacles impede movement in certain directions, especially if I want to transform items effectively.\n\n**Action Plan**:\n- I will first attempt to move left (to (12, 20)).

The objective of the game is to transform the \"potato\" sprites into their final form \"potatofull\" and reach the goal.\n\nCurrently, there are several \"potato\" sprites represented by 'j' in the game environment. In order to achieve victory, we need to ensure that the \"potatofull\" is ready prior to reaching the goal. The provided map indicates that there are multiple potatoes below our current position that we can possibly interact with.\n\nBased on the rules and available actions, the objective is to reach the goal (g) effectively. Since the avatar is already positioned one step away from the goal, the next viable action would be to navigate directly to the goal sprite.\n\nI will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action corresponds to moving DOWN, which will bring the avatar to the goal sprite for victory.

The closest assembly part is '@' which is located at (row=4, col=7) and (row=5, col=7). \n\nTo make progress, I will move towards the assembly part at (row=5, col=7). However, since I am positioned at (11, 19) and moving directly towards the assembly will take several steps due to the walls, I will consider the best direction first. \n\nAttempting to go DOWN will result in the avatar moving along the walls, which is inefficient.\n\nI will opt to move UP first toward the assembly:\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action positions the avatar nearer to the assembly and opens up further movement options in my next turn.
