The closest action would be moving to the right towards those 'e', while also keeping in mind the need to interact with the potato ('j') located below on row 2, and further lower down on rows 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n### Deciding Action\nThe first step would be to move to the right (column 2) to gather information on the next possible moves toward the collectible potatoes and levers.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action will allow us to navigate towards useful interactions while adhering to our strategy of exploring the nearby useful items and pathways effectively."

There are multiple \"potatoes\" available to collect, and we should also look for assemblies that can help with the transformation.\n\n### Surrounding Environment\n1.
