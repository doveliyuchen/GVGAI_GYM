The strategy suggests focusing on defending the base and managing resources effectively while prioritizing the destruction of alien portals and keeping a safe distance from incoming attacks.\n\n### Current Evaluation\n- The nearby aliens are represented as '@', and they can pose a threat by moving towards the base (located in row 4).\n- There are no immediate threats directly adjacent to the avatar, allowing for potential movement or attack without risk of immediate collision.\n- The goal is to maximize defense and attack efficiency; thus I should decide whether to stay put and shoot or move.\n\n### Next Action Decision\nFor this turn, I will move the avatar to the right (to (10, 2)), as staying in the same position does not align with the strategy of remaining mobile and effective in dodging attacks. Moving right might also position me better to engage any aliens should they advance further.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect to reposition the avatar effectively without encountering immediate threats directly adjacent to our current position."
