Considering your position, you can engage the nearby alien threats while remaining effective in base defense.\n\n### Action Plan:\nSince your position has not changed from the previous moves, you should consider taking a **defensive action** to deal with the immediate threats around you.

In our next turn, we will need to reposition. \n\n#### Choosing a Direction\nMoving to the left (toward (10, 1)) seems beneficial, as it will allow the avatar to potentially engage aliens directly. This movement may create an opportunity to take shots at the aliens approaching nearby portals while maintaining a safe distance from projectiles.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, based on the situation and strategy formulated, the action I choose will be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis left move is expected to allow the avatar to position itself better for offense while continuing to protect the base.

The avatar should take action to either position itself for a future attack or rotate towards potential threats.\n\nLet's consider taking action **1: ACTION_USE** to utilize the available resources (missiles or bombs) since the avatar is currently in a safe spot while being able to cover the base from afar.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing a missile could help reduce the alien threat quickly, adhering to the idea of scoring points while also surviving, as the closest threat directly aligns with the needs of base defense."

The ultimate goal is to protect the base from incoming alien attacks while taking out the enemies effectively.\n\nSince the avatar position does not change from the last state, it\u2019s crucial to analyze the situation before acting. The proposed strategic actions based on the current state align with maintaining both offensive and defensive positions.\n\n### Current Action Strategy\n1. **Use of Offensive Weapons**: A good first step is to utilize missiles or bombs to eliminate one of the nearby alien threats. The alien enemies are especially prevalent in rows 3 to 6 surrounding your position.\n2. **Positioning**: Furthermore, given that the avatar has not moved, this could be an opportunity to utilize ACTION_USE to attack the closest alien and potentially reduce immediate threats.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will select the action to utilize my offensive capabilities against the nearest alien. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to clear a nearby threat and align with our strategy of defending the base effectively. I expect to see some reduction in alien numbers as a result of this action."

There are several alien sprites (@) below your current position that are potential threats to the base located at row 9 (specifically, positions where '#' is present). \n\nYour objective remains to protect the base while surviving the waves of aliens. Right now, your position (10, 2) is quite safe, but to effectively engage the aliens, you need to move closer to them for an attack.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Avatar Position**: (10, 2).\n2. **Threat Level**: There are multiple aliens present at rows above you, particularly focused at row 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n3. **Action Strategy**: To change your current strategic position, you should move left or right. Since moving down or left does not provide immediate positioning to deal with the aliens, the best course of action would be to move toward available offensive positions.\n\nGiven this reasoning, let's consider moving **RIGHT** to (10, 3) so that you can potentially engage in combat with the aliens advancing toward the base.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action shifts your position, allowing you to maintain engagement opportunities with incoming threats while keeping the base intact. I expect this to align well with your overall defensive strategy."

There are multiple alien sprites '@' on the map, some of which are positioned close to your avatar.\n\n### Observations:\n- The closest threats are located directly above you at (9, 0) through (9, 2) and (10, 0) through (10, 2), all of which are '@' sprites (aliens).\n- You should consider engaging the aliens to prevent them from reaching your base.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince your position didn't change from the last action, it\u2019s essential to take a meaningful step. Moving in a direction to engage the aliens directly above you or using your actions to attack them is crucial. In this case, moving left to better position yourself or using an action to attack may be beneficial.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince moving left to (10, 2) would allow you to potentially attack at least two aliens located at (9, 0) and (9, 1), I will choose to move left.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nBy moving left, I expect to engage with the aliens and reduce the threat to the base, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing threats and actively removing them from play."
