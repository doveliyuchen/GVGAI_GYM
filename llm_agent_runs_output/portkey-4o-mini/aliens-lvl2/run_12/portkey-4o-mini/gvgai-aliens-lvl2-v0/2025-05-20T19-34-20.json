The environment consists of various enemies ('@'), a base ('#'), and a relatively clear area above the player's position where they can maneuver.\n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n1. **Avatar Position**: The avatar is located at the bottom left corner of the map (row 10). To avoid being overwhelmed by the aliens above, movement is critical.\n2. **Enemies**: Numerous enemies ('@') are present in the upper rows (0 through 2), posing a threat. Some portals (represented by '#' which are bunkered points) are also visible throughout the map.\n3. **Objective**: The main objective is to eliminate portals to stop enemy spawns while avoiding collisions with enemies and their bombs.\n\n### Strategy Based on Current State:\n- **Action Priority**: Given the clear space below and the immediate need to manage enemies effectively:\n  - Moving to the right may provide more options and increase score potential by engaging more enemies or securing a more strategic position.\n\nBased on the importance of changing position and adopting the strategy of moving away from the current bottleneck, I will execute a movement to the **RIGHT**.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should help reposition the avatar to a better gameplay space, allowing for further strategic decisions in the next moves."
