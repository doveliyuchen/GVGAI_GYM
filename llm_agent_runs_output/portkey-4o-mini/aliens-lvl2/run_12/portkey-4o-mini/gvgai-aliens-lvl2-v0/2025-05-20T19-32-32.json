Since there are likely threats positioned above, the ideal motion would place you in a position to either utilize your weapons effectively or evade immediate danger.\n\n### Action Choice\nGiven that your last action was to remain still (evidenced by your current position), let's perform a **right directional action** to position ourselves better relative to the aliens and increase engagement effectiveness.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will reposition you to (row 10, col 2), allowing you a better viewing angle of the threats and potential for future strategic moves while still keeping options open for attack or further avoidance as needed."
