The chase enemy at (row=3, col=3) is relatively far vertically from my avatar, but a chase enemy at (row=9, col=1) is about two rows down and could pose a potential threat.\n  \n### Strategy Consideration\n- I should be mobile and expose myself to less danger. Moving left (to col=-1, which is invalid) isn't an option, nor is moving down (to row=8), as it would step closer to a chase enemy. Moving right (to col=1) from (7,0) keeps me in the lower danger zone while maintaining distance from the chase enemy.\n\n### Chosen Action\nHere\u2019s the action I will take:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action is to move right from (7,0) to (7,1), allowing me to navigate the map better and maintain distance from the enemy, aligning with the strategy of staying mobile and managing threats effectively."
