However, the enemy at (3,0) is directional and could pose a threat if my avatar moves near that column.\n2. **Objective**: Eliminate enemies while avoiding taking damage. I need to stay away from enemies and ideally position myself to use any nearby cannons, given there's a score mechanism for enemy eliminations. \n\n### Actions Available:\n- **Left (1)**: This would move my avatar to (6,8).\n- **Right (2)**: This would move my avatar to (6,10).\n- **Down (3)**: This would move my avatar to (7,9).\n- **Up (4)**: This would move my avatar to (5,9).\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the enemy position, moving left (to (6,8)) or right (to (6,10)) keeps me in the same row but may approach other potential threats, while moving down (to (7,9)) doesn't get me closer to any immediate threats and allows me to mob to the horizontal direction since the enemy in that direction could become a threat.

The avatar is on the same column as some enemies that can shoot projectiles at it.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nGiven the avatar's current position, we need to reposition to a safer location away from the threat of any direct attacks while also allowing for possible movement towards or away from more enemies.
