There are also potential targets such as random enemies (located at (0, 9), (4, 5), (4, 13), (12, 9)), an enemy chasing me at (12, 0) mount an immediate threat, and a horizontal enemy at (9, 18).\n3. Additionally, the cannon does not seem to be in the vicinity right now; it might be strategic to reposition closer to an enemy or spawn point to effectively take them down.\n\n### Strategy Suggestion:\nSince my avatar has not moved since the last action, I need to take a direction that will reposition me closer to targets while maintaining mobility to avoid conflict with the chaser. The direction **LEFT** (Action 1) will shift my position to (6, 8), allowing a better angle to begin targeting enemies without moving directly into their attack range.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nTaking this action is expected to align with the strategy of managing enemy positions while preparing to engage them using the projected game mechanics effectively."
