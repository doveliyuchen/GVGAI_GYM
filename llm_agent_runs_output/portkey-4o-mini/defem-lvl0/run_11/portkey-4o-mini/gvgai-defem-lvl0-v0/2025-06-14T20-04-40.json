Special attention should be given to the chase enemy positioned at row 0, col 0 since it's the highest threat.\n- Gathering bullets can help in maintaining offensive capability. The bullet at (5, 9) can be collected while moving toward the right side of the map for safety and positioning.\n  \n### Recommended Action\nGiven that the avatar\u2019s position has not changed and considering the need to either collect resources or avoid threats:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right (towards col 10), closer to the bullet while staying away from the enemies that chase from above, ensuring a better strategic position.
