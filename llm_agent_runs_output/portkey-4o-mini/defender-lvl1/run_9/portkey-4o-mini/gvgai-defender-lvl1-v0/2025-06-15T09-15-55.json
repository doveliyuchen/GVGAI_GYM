There are several alien sprites nearby at (1,0), (1,1), (1,19), (1,20), (1,22), (1,23), (3,0), (3,1), (3,6), (3,7), (3,15), (3,16), (3,21), (3,22), (5,10), (5,11), (5,25), and various others along the bottom rows.\n3. The objective is to survive while maintaining city health by collecting supplies for ammunition and eliminating aliens.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Since you are currently at (11,6) and there are two supplies directly above you at (10,6) and (9,6), the immediate action should be to move up to the supply at (10,6) to replenish your ammunition or gather resources.\n\nBased on your position and the goal to collect supplies efficiently:\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action will allow you to gather resources while considering your immediate needs for survival, and I expect to see the collection of supplies, boosting ammunition for ongoing battles."

The immediate priority is to ensure survival while protecting the city, which means the player must either eliminate the aliens or collect supplies to maintain resources.\n2. The avatar is positioned well for collecting the supply located at (10, 6). Collecting supplies is vital for replenishing bullets and ensuring readiness to combat aliens.\n3. Avoid direct confrontation if possible; instead, focus on collecting supplies while keeping an eye on alien movements and ensuring city health is not compromised.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven the urgent need to collect supplies for maintaining ammo, my chosen action is to move downward to collect the supply located at (10, 6).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action places me in a better position to gather resources, aligning with the strategic objective of efficient resource management and survival."

Given the presence of aliens and bombs, it's crucial to assess the dangers while seeking to collect supplies for bullets.\n\n2. **Avatar Strategy**:\n   - Currently, I am surrounded by allies and relatively safe from immediate alien threats, so I should prioritize collecting supplies to maintain ammunition.\n   - The nearest supply (s) is at (12,2) which is on the left side of the avatar.\n\n3. **Movement**: As the avatar is positioned at (12,4), the most logical action is to move left to (12,3) before potentially moving left again to collect the supply in the next potential step.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to move left towards the supply, which is a key strategy in resource management to replenish ammunition. I expect that by doing this, it will keep me safe while getting closer to fulfillment of the secondary objective."
