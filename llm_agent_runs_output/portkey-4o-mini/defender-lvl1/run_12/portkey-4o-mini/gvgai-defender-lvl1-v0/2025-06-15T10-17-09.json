Specifically, in row 5 at (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 14), (5, 25), and (5, 26), as well as in row 4 at (4, 4), (4, 5), etc.\n- There are supplies available at (1, 2) and (2, 2), as well as an ammo portal at (0, 2) and (0, 6).\n- The city '@' is located at (12,11) and (12,24), which we have to defend.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- The priority is to collect supplies and eliminate threats posed by aliens. There's a red alert for nearby alien threats.\n- The avatar cannot stay in the same position for too long without acting since the situation with aliens could worsen.\n\n**Assessing the Position:**\nFrom the avatar's current position (4,1), moving left is not valid (as it will go out of bounds), right (to 4,2) is empty, down (to 5,1) is empty, and up (to 3,1) is also empty (also upward is still safe distance from aliens right now). However, moving right will be closer to the potential alien threats.\n\nBased on the surrounding state, the quicker option to avoid being damaged and to remain aggressive would be to gather supplies at (1, 2) or (2, 2).

The avatar should approach the supply drop '(&)' at (2, 2) by moving up twice (because it is essential to collect resources for shooting).\n2.
