Collecting these supplies can ensure your ammo does not run out.\n3. **Positioning and Movement**: To avoid being attacked, the next move should ideally involve either shooting at the enemies or repositioning to collect supplies while maintaining a gaze on immediate threats.\n\nSince your avatar is currently positioned well to collect a supply at (2, 2), I recommend moving up (if no immediate threat blocks that) or left towards the supply. \n\n### Action Decision:\nSince we need to ensure the avatar starts moving to collect supplies while being aware of the immediate danger from aliens, \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will allow us to navigate towards a potential supply point and perhaps create a strategic distance from the immediate threats.

Also, ensure to move towards supply items to collect more bullets.\n2. **Priority:** Since there are enemies nearby, you might want to move away from them after collecting supplies and then engage them from a safer distance.\n\n### Recommended Action\nYou should prioritize the action of moving to collect a bullet supply, which is located at (row 1, col 2) or (row 2, col 2). However, you are currently blocked to the left and above by walls in rows 0 and 3. \n\nTo collect the supply at (row 1, col 6) where there is a bullet supply available directly above your current position (row 7, col 4), the correct path would involve moving upwards.

It's vital to shoot them down before they reach the city.\n\n3. **Resource Management**:\n   The avatar must manage its bullets effectively. It currently has a maximum capacity of 20 rounds and needs to collect supplies to replenish them. There are supplies (bullets) at (4,6) and (5,6) close by, which can be advantageous to collect.\n\n4. **Next Move**:\n   Since the last reported state had the avatar at (1, 2), and if it has not moved since then, a simple upward movement may not be enough to avoid confrontation with aliens or collect supplies. Hence, I will choose an action that both coincides with the need to reposition and address the immediate threats.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nBased on the above analysis, I will move **down** to (2,2) to avoid the close alien threats and give myself more flexibility for further actions on the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving down will strategically position the avatar while keeping an eye on the alien threats above.
