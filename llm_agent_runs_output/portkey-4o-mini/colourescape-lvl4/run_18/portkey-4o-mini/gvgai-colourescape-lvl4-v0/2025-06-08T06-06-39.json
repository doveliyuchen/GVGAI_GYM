The immediate goal is to reach the exit represented by '%', located at (6, 16).\n\n### Analysis of Current Surroundings:\n1. **Current Position**: (1, 2) where the avatar 'e' is located.\n2. **Nearby Entities**:\n   - To the left (1, 1): Floor (.)\n   - To the right (1, 3): Floor (.)\n   - Above (0, 2): Wall (r)\n   - Below (2, 2): Hole (h)\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- **Cannot Move Up**: There's a wall directly above.\n- **Down Move**: Leads to a hole, which is dangerous.\n- **Left and Right Moves**: Both lead to floor tiles, allowing potential movement without immediate hazards.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the primary goal is to avoid falling into the hole below, and determining we cannot move down, the best immediate action is to move either left or right. Moving right (to 1, 3) may provide a better pathway, as both directions are available, but moving to (1, 3) might offer the next insights into possible actions.\n\nExecuting the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to (1, 3) allows for further exploration while avoiding immediate hazards, aligning with the strategy to assess and adapt to the surroundings."

From this position, I can analyze the surrounding tiles to determine the most strategic move.\n\n### Nearby Environment:\n- **Left (1, 2)**: Empty space (.)\n- **Right (1, 4)**: Empty space (.)\n- **Down (2, 3)**: Blue Switch (b)\n- **Up (0, 3)**: Wall (r)\n\nFrom this analysis, my only actionable moves are to the left (1, 2), right (1, 4), or down (2, 3). \n\n### Objective:\nThe immediate goal is to either reach the exit or interact with the corresponding tiles that can aid in attaining a favorable position. While reaching the exit (which is at position (6, 16)) is the ultimate target, utilizing the blue switch might convert my avatar into a useful type or open up new pathways.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo take advantage of the available blue switch below me, I will move **down** to (2, 3) to interact with the blue switch.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down to the blue switch should allow me to potentially change my avatar type and progress toward the exit more effectively."
