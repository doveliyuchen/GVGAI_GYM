The exit is located at `(6,16)`, which is crucial for winning the game.\n\n### Action Selection\nGiven that the avatar's exact position is unclear and the last action may not have resulted in movement, taking action to potentially navigate or interact with surrounding elements is vital. Since the map is heavily wall-structured on the top, exploring towards an area with potential movement may allow for further actions.\n\nI will take the action to move **RIGHT (2)**, which may lead to exploration of potential paths or interactions with boxes and switches nearby. If this does not yield movement or progress, I will analyze further based on resulting positions.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving to the right may open up new pathways to explore towards the exit while considering nearby obstacles."

Given the rules and layout, I need to locate my 'normalAvatar' (denoted as 'e') on the map.\n- The surrounding elements include walls (r), exits (%), holes (h), and various switches and boxes.\n\n### Position Analysis\nFrom the map representation:\n- The rows and columns demonstrate that the normal avatar ('e') can be found and must navigate through the map avoiding 'h' (holes) and aiming for '%' (exits).\n- The normal avatar is located in row 1, column 6, which offers pathways to the right with a blue switch available at row 1, column 10 that can influence how I can progress.\n\n### Potential Moves\n1. The immediate plan is to explore the environment and manipulate the blue switch, as interacting with it can potentially change the avatar's state allowing different interactions with other elements on the map, specifically the blue boxes.\n2. It looks like moving LEFT, RIGHT, or UP might result in encountering walls or holes, and DOWN would allow me to interact with my objective more easily or maneuver around the area effectively.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven that moving right will lead me to the blue switch at (1,10), which is crucial for progressing since activating this switch can change my avatar's form and unlock further navigational routes:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves me to the right, allowing me to interact with the blue switch and opening up more possibilities for moving forward or manipulating boxes thereafter.

Notably, there is a green switch (`&`) located right below the avatar at (7, 1), and the exit (`%`) is located at (6, 16). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The avatar can interact with various elements around it, including boxes and switches, to navigate through the level.\n- To progress towards the exit, the avatar must avoid falling into holes or running out of time.\n- Since the avatar's position can change based on interactions with the elements around, the immediate next step should focus on utilizing interactions to move towards the exit.\n\n### Next Actions to Consider:\n1. **Approaching the Exit**: The exit is located to the right (east) of the avatar.

Given the sprite mapping and the layout of the game, I'll start by identifying all relevant features around the avatar.\n\nFrom the provided map:\n\n- The rows and columns of the map contain various entities, including walls (`r`), exit (`%`), holes (`h`), normal and special boxes, switches, and the avatar itself.\n- I don't have the position of the avatar as of yet, but I would generally place it on one of the specified spaces represented by `a`, and I should assume my avatar is a normal avatar (`e`).\n\nThe map does not show the avatar's real-time position, but it does indicate a series of walls (`r`) and some tiles with potential valid features. \n\nSince the surroundings of my avatar's assumed position are important for determining the next move, I will analyze the immediate options.\n\n### Strategy Based on Layout\n1. **Identifying Immediate Actions**: If I perceive the avatar to be at a position near boxes, switches, or exits, I need to evaluate the next possible moves:\n   - Checking the left, right, up, and down options.\n   - Engaging with available boxes or switches if they are in immediate proximity.\n\n2. **Avoidance of Holes**: I will need to be careful not to move toward any holes (`h`) that might lead to a loss. I also need to ensure I can avoid any obstacles posed by the walls (`r`).\n\n3. **Analyzing Moves and Expectations**: After choosing an action, I must evaluate whether this move positions me closer to an exit or better allows me to navigate through the level successfully.\n\nLet's assume my avatar is located at a point where right, left, or down movements are possible. Given the ceiling of walls on the periphery of the map, it is strategically wise to focus on downward or lateral movement where there might be opportunities to reach the exit eventually.\n\n### Next Action\nHowever, since I need to make an informed choice based on the map, and I haven't moved or interacted with any elements yet, I am limited right now in direction. \n\nI'll choose `ACTION_RIGHT` as my first action because moving right tends to yield more options based upon the sprite placements around the world.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis move is anticipated to provide new information that could be used to evaluate my options further in this complex level layout."

The goal is to reach the exit (noted as '%') while avoiding holes (noted as 'b').\n\nGiven the strategic approach, I need to explore the surroundings and ensure I avoid any holes while trying to access the exit. Additionally, I must be cautious of interactions with boxes and switches which could change the avatar's form or position.\n\nSince the action to take must be meaningful and based on the current state, I\u2019ll:\n\n- Check if the avatar's position remains unchanged (which cannot be assessed clearly as the avatar's current location isn't visually represented in the mapping).\n\nLet's assume the avatar needs to navigate right (as to logically progress toward the exit) with a direct action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action allows for checking progress towards navigating to the right. If the avatar does not move, it indicates I may have rotated without motion, and I will reassess. My expectation is to align with the objectives efficiently by moving towards the exit."

The immediate goal is to reach the exit (represented by '%'), which is positioned at (6, 16).\n3. The map contains walls (represented by 'r'), holes (indicated as 'h'), switches ('b', 'c', 'd', etc.), various boxes, and pathways.\n4. I must pay attention to potential obstacles, such as holes that could cause a loss if encountered.\n\nEvaluating the surroundings, I need to find a way towards the exit while avoiding walls and other obstacles. I can see that there's a combination of switches and pathways that may help in reaching the exit.\n\nSince I don't have a specific current position for my avatar, I'm unable to move directly. Therefore, I'll begin by initiating a directional action to check if it causes any movement towards the exit or towards a relevant switch.\n\nLet's execute the action to move DOWN (since moving down seems to open pathways based on previous observations).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nBy moving down, I expect to see if it allows for further moves or the potential of interacting with any switches or accessible spaces that would bring me closer to the exit. This action is the first step toward exploring the level and assessing the next optimal move."

There are several empty spaces (.) and various interactive elements. \n\n### Immediate Elements\n- The map features walls (r), holes (h), boxes ($), colored switches (like @, &, g, etc.), and the exit (%).\n- There are also potential interaction elements such as normal switches and green boxes along with mechanisms that could bounce or interact with the avatar.\n  \n### Strategy Based on Available Map\n1. **Identify Avatar Position**: I need to locate where my avatar is, ideally by inferring from any move I've made or interactable elements around the vicinity if I can consider the last known position.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: I must steer clear of holes (h) as those will cause me to lose the game.\n3. **Reach the Exit**: The exit is located at (6, 16), which may require navigating around walls and using boxes strategically.\n\n### Possible Actions\nConsidering that I need to make a movement, but since the avatar's position isn't specifically provided, I will assume a move to the right (to (1, 2) if I was positioned at (1, 1) last) makes sense to explore available tiles, potentially moving further towards the exit on future passes.\n\nI'll perform the following action based on this thought process:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is moving right, allowing me to explore what lies beyond my immediate surroundings. My expectation is to identify more elements that can assist in reaching the exit point (%)."
