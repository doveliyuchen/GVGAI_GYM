There are a few important elements nearby:\n\n- At (1, 6), there is a red box 'n'.\n- At (3, 3), there is a green box '*'.\n- At (3, 4), there is a blue box '#'.\n- At (3, 5), there is a normal box '$'.\n- At (5, 5), there is a blue switch 'b'.\n- The exit '%' is at (6, 16).\n\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed yet, I'll explore options to approach relevant switches or boxes without moving recklessly. The immediate available action is to determine if moving left or right brings me closer to actionable elements or the exit, given the strategic importance of box manipulation according to the mechanics outlined.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving left to (1, 1) will be checked first as it may reveal more about the surroundings or allow me to access new areas.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nFeedback: This left movement helps evaluate what potential paths and interactions are available while planning the next step toward the exit."

The first decision is crucial since the area surrounding the avatar mostly consists of empty spaces ('.') and interactable elements like boxes and switches. \n\nTo plan the next move, we should check the immediate surroundings of the avatar:\n- **(1, 0)** through **(1, 4)** are mostly clear with significant options.\n- The avatar can interact with the red box at (1, 6) and the blue switch at (1, 10).\n\nConsidering the strategy to use the switches wisely, I can move right to the empty space (1, 2) and prepare for further actions.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the overall strategy as it keeps options open and prepares the avatar for interactions with nearby elements. After moving to (1, 2), I will evaluate the next best action based on new surroundings."

I need to reach the exit at position (6, 16) while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the surrounding elements effectively.\n\n### Analysis of Immediate Surroundings:\n\n- **At (1,2)**, the avatar can interact with:\n  - **Above (0, 2)**: Wall (r)\n  - **Below (2, 2)**: Hole (h) - dangerous\n  - **Left (1, 1)**: Empty space (.)\n  - **Right (1, 3)**: Empty space (.)\n  \n- There are several colored boxes and switches I can potentially interact with, but they are not directly adjacent to my current position. The level contains multiple pathways, and I must choose my next move carefully.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nI cannot go straight down because of the hole at (2,2). I need to explore the empty spaces around me to find a safer route while keeping in mind my goal of reaching the exit. Moving left or right can help me reposition - specifically, moving to the right (1,3) appears to lead to more options.\n\nI'll take action to move right into (1, 3).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action moves my avatar to the right into an empty space, allowing for additional exploration without any immediate threats, which aligns with my strategy of carefully navigating around known obstacles."
