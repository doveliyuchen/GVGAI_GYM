The avatar ('e') is located at (1, 2). \n\n**Immediate Surroundings:**\n- Up (0, 2): Wall ('r')\n- Down (2, 2): Hole ('h'), which is a negative interaction.\n- Left (1, 1): Empty space ('.'), which can be moved to.\n- Right (1, 3): Empty space ('.'), which can be moved to.\n\nAs the only safe moves from this position appear to be left (to (1, 1)) or right (to (1, 3)), I will choose **to move right** to (1, 3), avoiding the hole that is directly below me. This aligns with the strategy to avoid hazards and maintain a positive gameplay flow.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nMoving right should allow for further exploration of the level without risk of falling into the hole. I expect to assess my next move once I arrive at (1, 3)."

The goal is to reach the green exit located at (6, 16).\n\nBased on the map:\n- To the right of the avatar, there is an empty space (1, 4).\n- Below the avatar, there is another empty space (2, 3).\n- The left of the avatar contains an empty space (1, 2) but moving left does not contribute positively to reaching the exit.\n- The top direction has walls (0, 3 to 0, 17), which means that route is not available.\n\nFollowing strategy to plan movements:\n1. Move down to (2, 3) to check the area below and further evaluate potential movements towards the exit or transformations.\n2. The position (2, 3) has a hole (2, 2) directly left, which we want to avoid, and a box (3, 3) below which could be interacted with later. \n\nThus, the immediate strategy will be to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action should allow for assessing new possibilities for further movement or activating transformations to reach the exit effectively."
