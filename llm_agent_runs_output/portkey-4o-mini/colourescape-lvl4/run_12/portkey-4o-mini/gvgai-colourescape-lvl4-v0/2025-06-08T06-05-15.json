Moving left (1, 1) does not offer any strategic advantage since it leads away from open areas, so I will move right toward (1, 3).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to allow me to stay in a safe position and assess further moves without encountering immediate threats."

Surrounding it are various elements on the grid:\n- The cell above (0, 3) contains a wall ('r'), which indicates the avatar cannot move up.\n- The cells below (2, 3) and (2, 4) contain a hole ('h') underneath the avatar, which would be a risk if the avatar moved downward.\n- To the left (1, 2) and right (1, 4) are empty spaces ('.'), allowing for movement in those directions.\n\nGiven that movement downwards is dangerous due to the hole, and considering the strategy to avoid hazards, I have two options \u2014 moving left or right.\n\nBoth left (to (1, 2)) or right (to (1, 4)) would keep the avatar safe. However, moving right (to (1, 4)) leads towards another available move, potentially advancing closer to areas with boxes or switches.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I will choose to move right.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action allows progress without incurring risk from holes, aligning with the strategy of planning moves wisely and avoiding hazards."

The immediate surroundings consist of various sprites: unyielding walls ('r'), a red box ('n') directly to the right at (1, 6), and a blue switch ('@') at (1, 10).\n\nTo progress towards the goal, I need to interact with the environment strategically, utilizing boxes or switches to navigate. The next logical move considering the game mechanics, which state I can't move through walls and need to manage my position with respect to the colored objects, is to attempt to move left, as there is an empty space (.) to (1, 3):\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this action will change my position, allowing me to assess further moves towards reaching the exit while avoiding hazards."

The goal is to navigate through the various obstacles, avoiding the holes and aiming to reach the exit marked with `%`.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n    - **Left (1, 2)**: Empty (.)\n    - **Right (1, 4)**: Empty (.)\n    - **Up (0, 3)**: Wall (r)\n    - **Down (2, 3)**: Box (b)\n\nSince there are no immediate hazards (like holes) around the avatar, we can consider moving down to interact with the box. Additionally, moving left or right does not facilitate reaching the next obstacles or the exit at `(6, 16)` effectively.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nGiven that there is a box directly below the avatar, it makes sense to interact with it by moving down to potentially set off a sequence of actions enabling further progress. \n\nThus, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move the avatar down onto the box, allowing the potential for the next steps in navigating the level. I expect that interacting with the box will open up more movement options towards the exit."
