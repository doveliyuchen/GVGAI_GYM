There are also several boxes and a green switch nearby, which allows for potential transformations to interact with game mechanics.\n  \n### Strategy:\n- My immediate goal should be to avoid falling into the hole. Since the position of the avatar remains constant, I will consider my next action carefully to ensure movement.\n- The green switch may provide access to different colored states of the avatar, which could aid in manipulating the surrounding boxes.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. Move **left** (1, 1) which is empty.\n2. Move **right** (1, 3) which is also empty.\n3. Move **up** (0, 2) which is blocked by walls.\n4. **Down** (2, 2) will lead to the hole, which is not advisable.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with the action that moves my avatar to the right to an adjacent safe position (1, 3).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to move my avatar safely without encountering the hole, providing an opportunity to explore further or find a switch."

(empty).\n- **Right (row 3, col 6):** box '$'.\n\nThe possible actions we can consider are moving left, right, up, or down. Currently, both up and down  contain boxes that we can potentially interact with, while moving left or right puts us into empty spaces or boxes which would be beneficial for bouncing.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n1. The goal is to reach the exit '%', which is located at (row 6, col 16).\n2. I see that moving down to (row 4, col 5), which contains a box '$', appears to be a promising option. It would maintain movement momentum while also interacting with a box potentially useful for later navigation.\n3. Avoiding holes is essential, and ensuring that the avatar\u2019s state (color) remains aligned with box interactions is critical for future actions.\n\nGiven that moving down seems to maintain the flow and allow for potential interactions, my action will be to move down.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis change is expected to create more opportunities to navigate onward toward the exit effectively while interacting with the environment."

I notice several bouncing boxes and other structural elements such as holes ('h') and walls ('r') that need to be approached cautiously.\n2. I need to prioritize reaching switches to accessboxes for bouncing towards areas leading to the exit.\n3. However, in more immediate terms, I must first assess my next move while being mindful of potential pitfalls.\n\nSince moving down to (5, 5) allows me to use the switch, it may give me a transformation to interact with nearby boxes effectively. \n\nThus, I will choose to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nBy moving down, I aim to activate the switch and assess my options further for optimal progress toward the exit."
