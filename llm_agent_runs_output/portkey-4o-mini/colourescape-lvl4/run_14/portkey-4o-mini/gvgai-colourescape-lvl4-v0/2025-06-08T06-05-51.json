The immediate surroundings consist of:\n\n- Above (0, 2): wall ('r')\n- Below (2, 2): hole ('h'), which would \"kill\" you if entered\n- Left (1, 1): empty floor ('.')\n- Right (1, 3): empty floor ('.')\n\nGiven these conditions, you cannot move up or down and moving left or right does not put you in immediate danger, although there are no advantageous actions available that could help you progress towards the exit.\n\nAs per the provided strategies, it's essential to assess the layout and prepare for potential actions. Since no forward motion can be undertaken and I need to act differently than the last action (which was effectively none), I'll consider trying to change direction to ensure the avatar rotates appropriately first.\n\nI'll proceed with a right action in hopes of moving away from the current position while looking for potential later interactions.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action should lead to my avatar moving right towards (1, 3) and may help analyze future interactions better."
