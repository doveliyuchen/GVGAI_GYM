The **avatar position** and interactions are crucial for progressing towards the exit. The exit '%' is located at (6, 16). \n2. Our immediate focus should be how the avatar interacts with switches and boxes to navigate towards the exit.\n3. The first few rows consist largely of walls ('r'), with identifiable sprites including switches, boxes, and holes requiring careful navigation given the transitions between different forms of the avatar.\n\nSince there have been no prior movements indicated, I'll analyze any viable moves toward getting closer to the exit while ensuring to avoid unnecessary hazards like holes.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Actions:\n- I notice several options for moving right through empty spaces ('.') with potential interactions with the blue and green switches ('b', '&'), leading to boxes, however, moving into a hole ('h') must be avoided.\n- The exit path seems to be available to the right at the sixth row, suggesting that moving right is a beneficial direction.\n\nSince the avatar position does not show any movement yet, I will take a step *to the right*, aiming to get closer to the exit.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action makes sense as the primary goal is to reach the exit while observing efficient interactions with available sprites along the way. I expect to see progress on this strategic path toward the exit."
