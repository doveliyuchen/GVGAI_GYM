The objective of the game is to defeat these aliens while avoiding negative interactions, such as colliding with bombs ('&') or being hit by alien projectiles.\n\nCurrently, I see that there are no immediate threats surrounding my avatar in the current row (10), but the aliens above can potentially move or shoot, posing a risk if I remain stationary.\n\nBased on the strategy that prioritizes staying mobile and engaging enemies, I will take a LEFT action, which should allow me to see if there are any beneficial items or strategies on the left side of the screen while preparing to engage the aliens if necessary.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should reposition me and allow me to reassess the threats, adhering to the strategy of prioritizing movement to avoid becoming a target."

There are multiple alien sprites (@) scattered throughout the upper rows, but no immediate threats are directly around the avatar at (10, 0).\n\nGiven the previous assessments:\n- **Stay Mobile**: Even though there are no immediate threats, I should consider moving to a position where I can better engage with the alien sprites.\n- **Prioritize Threats**: The closest aliens are at (3, 0) and (3, 3), which I can target on my way up.\n- **Movement Strategy**: We should try to find an advantageous position, so I will move left (as my current column is 0) won't help, and right (to engage potential enemies) is blocked by walls. The best move is to maneuver in a direction where there's more opportunity to confront aliens.\n\nAs the next logical move, I will press ACTION_RIGHT to attempt repositioning towards potential threats in a future turn.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nWith this move, I expect to change my position towards engaging the aliens while ensuring mobility."

Since the avatar is positioned at the bottom (row 10), the optimal action would involve moving either left or right to avoid the potential hazards while maintaining mobility.\n\nConsidering the current state, I notice that there's a clear path to the left.
