The immediate goal is to eliminate the alien threats and protect the base from incoming attacks.\n\n### State Analysis\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: (10, 3)\n2. **Nearby Threats**: The area around the avatar does not currently have any visible aliens; however, there are numerous aliens present on the rows above, particularly rows 1 to 4.\n3. **Base Position**: The base is situated at various locations throughout the map, specifically at (7, 6), (7, 13), (7, 18), and (7, 26). It's crucial to maintain their integrity.\n4. **Projectiles**: There doesn't seem to be any available projectiles indicated in the current state near the avatar.\n5. **Next Steps**: The main strategy is to move towards a position where the avatar can effectively engage with aliens and target the portals. \n\n### Analysis of Directions\nThe avatar is currently positioned quite low on the map. Moving **up** to rows with alien threats will allow for more proactive defense and elimination of aliens.\n\n### Deciding on an Action\nSince the avatar's current position does not change, it\u2019s essential to make a movement action. The best strategy would be to move **UP** to engage or set ourselves in a better position to attack.\n\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** does not seem meaningful as there are no immediate threats.\n- The most effective action would be to move **UP** to row 9, targeting the aliens in rows 1-4.\n\nHere, I will take the action to move left (2) or right (3), resulting in a rotation effect since it does not have any benefits. \n\nTaking above factors into consideration, the best course of action is:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar upwards toward potential alien threats while ensuring that we are on the same level to better plan our strategy next round. My expectation is to see if this positioning allows for an effective attack during the next turn."

You should first rotate towards the direction where the active threats (aliens) exist.\n\nConsidering the state of your avatar's position hasn't changed since the last action, I will choose to rotate my avatar left to face the area where the aliens are concentrated.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis positions your avatar slightly better for the next move and keeps you in a state of awareness towards potential threats.

Moving **left** to (10, 0) would allow me to stay back and gain better control at the edge while assessing the threats above.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left will help in avoiding potential alien overlap while positioning for a better line of sight to attack aliens without jeopardizing base defenses.
