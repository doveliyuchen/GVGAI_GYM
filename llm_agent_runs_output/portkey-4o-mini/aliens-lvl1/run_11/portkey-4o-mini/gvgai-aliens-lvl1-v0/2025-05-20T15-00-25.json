There are several aliens (@) present in close proximity, particularly in rows 1-4, while bombs (%) are falling from those aliens above.\n\nGiven the strategy outlined, I need to maintain positioning, focus on shooting down the aliens that pose a threat to my base, and avoid getting hit by bombs. Based on the sprite layout, I can take immediate action to either the left or right, but I should first assess if a directional action will successfully position me.\n\nIn this case, moving LEFT (col=1) does not seem optimal since that could take me closer to the bombs at (2,1) or (3,1). Moving RIGHT (to col=3) doesn't reveal any immediate danger nor does it place me in a position to shoot effectively.\n\nSince my position hasn't changed, I will move right to see if it influences my next steps. \n\nI will use the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nI expect that moving to the right will put me in a better tactical position to shoot down the aliens while evading the bombs, aligning with my overall strategy of keeping mobile and prioritizing threats."
