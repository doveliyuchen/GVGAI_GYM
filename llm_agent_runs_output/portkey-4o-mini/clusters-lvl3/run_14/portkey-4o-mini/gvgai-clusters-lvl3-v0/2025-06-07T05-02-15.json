Actions must be taken carefully to avoid breaking any box or losing the avatar.\n\nLet's examine possible actions:\n- Moving left to (7, 6): This area is empty (.) and will not interact with any boxes directly.\n- Moving right to (7, 8): This position contains a box (#) that can be interacted with.\n- Moving up to (6, 7): This position is also empty (.).\n- Moving down to (8, 7): This position is empty (.).\n\nGiven the position of the nearest box and considering the objective to eliminate it, it would be strategic to move right to interact with the box located at (7, 8).\n\nNow, I will perform the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to potentially interact with the box located at (7, 8) and work towards clearing it, aligning with the strategy of managing the box inventory safely without putting the avatar at risk."
