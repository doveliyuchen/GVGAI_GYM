The immediate goal is to eliminate boxes while avoiding holes and managing the positioning of blocks.\n\nThe nearby relevant items are:\n- Below the avatar at (9, 7) is a wall ('g').\n- To the left at (8, 6) is an empty floor ('.').\n- To the right at (8, 8) is also an empty floor ('.').\n- Above the avatar at (7, 7) is a space ('.'), and above that at (6, 7) there is a redbox ('b').\n\nSince there are no immediate threats, and I can't move further down due to a wall, let's explore the possible movements. The goal would be to reach the redbox to eliminate it.\n\nI'll first try moving up to (7, 7).\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should allow exploration towards the redbox while maintaining a focus on the objective of eliminating boxes.

    "content": "Given the current state of the game board, you are positioned at (row=7, col=7) where the avatar ('a') is located. \n\n### Current State Overview:\n- There are hazards (holes '&') at positions (5, 8), (3, 5), (3, 8), and (7, 3).\n- You have blue boxes ('#') at (2, 3), green boxes ('%') at (2, 8), (4, 7), (6, 3), and red blocks ('b') at (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5).\n- There are also blue blocks ('@') at (7, 9).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. You need to interact with boxes to eliminate them for your main objective (SpriteCounter for boxes reaching zero).\n2. Avoid falling into holes while navigating through the level.\n3. The action to move toward or manipulate boxes will be key now.\n\n### Explore Possible Moves:\nThe possible actions from your current position (7, 7) are moving left (to (7, 6)), right (to (7, 8)), up (to (6, 7)), or down (to (8, 7)). \n\n- **Action LEFT (7, 6)**: This cell is empty (.), which allows moving horizontally without any risk.\n- **Action RIGHT (7, 8)**: This cell is empty (.), which also allows moving horizontally.\n- **Action UP (6, 7)**: This cell is empty (.), which allows moving vertically.\n- **Action DOWN (8, 7)**: This cell is empty (.), which allows moving vertically.\n\nSince you have a blue box at (2, 3), and your goal is to eliminate boxes, moving towards a box might be prudent in upcoming moves. Currently, none of the immediate adjacent cells contain boxes, but the closest box is located above you.\n\nGiven all these considerations, the best action is to go **UP** (to (6, 7)).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to lead you closer to evaluating interactions with nearby boxes in your next moves."

The objective is to eliminate all boxes in the level. \n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n- At the current position (6, 8), there is a bluebox (#).\n- I can interact with this bluebox to transform it into a score-giving block, which is essential for progress.\n- There are also holes around (5, 5) and (5, 8), which I need to avoid as they will lead to a loss if I fall into them.\n  \n### Strategy:\n1. Target the bluebox directly above my avatar (6, 8).\n2. Manipulate it into a block to achieve a score and potentially clear the level objectives faster.\n3. Always be careful of moving towards holes after the interaction.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince interacting with the bluebox involves moving upwards into the space of the bluebox (which will likely transform it), I will choose to move UP.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will allow me to engage with the bluebox, helping me to target the level's objective. I expect that this aligns with our strategy of prioritizing box management."
