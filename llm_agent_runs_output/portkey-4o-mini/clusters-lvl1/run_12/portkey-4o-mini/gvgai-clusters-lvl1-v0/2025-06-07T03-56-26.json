    "content": "Given the current state, my avatar 'a' is positioned at (row=6, col=7).\n\nLooking at the layout surrounding the avatar, I can see various sprites:\n\n- Columns reachable from my position (col=6, col=8, col=7) include a green block '%' to the north (row=6, col=6), a hole '&' south (row=7, col=7), and a block '#' at (row=6, col=10). \n\n### Available Actions Analysis:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2, 6)**: Moving left (to row=6, col=6) would allow me to interact with the green block '%'.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2, 8)**: Moving right (to row=6, col=8) would bring me to a free space '.'.\n3. **ACTION_UP (1, 7)**: Moving up (to row=5, col=7) takes me to a free space '.'.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (3, 6)**: Moving down (to row=7, col=7) leads me into a hole '&', which results in losing an avatar.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe best action is to move left (ACTION_LEFT) to interact with the green block '%'. This action is strategic and meaningful as it facilitates a potential transformation or interaction with the adjacent sprites.\n\nUsing the mechanics, this action should be the priority as it sets up for potential point generation and interaction with important game elements.\n\nTherefore, I will execute:\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should maintain momentum in the game while avoiding hazards and pursuing advantageous interactions with the game environment."

There are boxes located at:\n- (2, 3) - bluebox ('#')\n- (2, 4) - redbox ('b')\n- (2, 6) - redbox ('b')\n- (2, 8) - greenblock ('$')\n- (2, 9) - greenbox ('%')\n- (4, 10) - bluebox ('#')\n- Alongside other boxes located at various positions.\n\nThe main objective is to clear the boxes by interacting with them. Currently, there doesn't seem to be an immediate box in reach. \n\n### Current Action:\nSince I am surrounded by empty spaces and need to reposition to potentially access more boxes, I will choose to move either left or right. Here, moving left to (6, 5) gives me the opportunity to potentially reach the bluebox at (2, 3) in future moves.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this will keep me moving toward the direction of the boxes while maintaining an optimal strategy for future transformations."
