The immediate surroundings are checkered with obstacles and potential actions, particularly boxes and holes.\n\n- Below (row 9, col 6) is a wall ('g'), which cannot be passed.\n- Above (row 7, col 6) is empty ('.').\n- Left (row 8, col 5) is empty ('.').\n- Right (row 8, col 7) is empty ('.').\n\nSince I have the option to move left, right, or up but can\u2019t move down (due to wall obstruction), I should carefully consider whether moving changes the state positively by interacting with boxes or clearing paths.\n\nGiven the current environment and following the strategic advice to keep my movements sensible, moving up seems ideal to explore possibilities further in the area above.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up to (row 7, col 6) allows for more potential actions in subsequent turns while avoiding any immediate hazards like holes. I anticipate uncovering more opportunities to position myself effectively towards the goal of clearing all boxes."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is positioned at (8, 6). The immediate surroundings are:\n\n- The row above (7) has empty spaces and two holes. \n- The row below (9) is entirely walls, except for the last (10-12) which are walls.\n- To the left (8, 5) is an empty space, while to the right (8, 7) is also an empty space.\n- Below the avatar, there is a hole at (9, 5).\n\nIn this situation, I need to focus on moving strategically to clear boxes and avoiding falling into holes. Since there are no boxes directly around my current position and moving left or right won't affect the game state negatively, I can move left to explore that area.\n\nThus, I'll take action 1 to move left:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nMoving left will allow me to see what lies in that direction and potentially find a way to clear boxes or position myself better. This aligns with the strategy of exploring the environment and maintaining a safe position away from holes."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar 'a' is located at (8, 5). The surrounding cells include holes, walls, and various types of boxes.\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n1. **Current Location**: Your avatar is at the floor level, surrounded by empty tiles and holes below at (5, 5), (6, 5), and (7, 5) which must be avoided.\n2. **Boxes and Blocks**: There are green boxes ('%'), blue boxes ('#'), and red blocks ('*') around the area that can be manipulated to fulfill the win condition of clearing all boxes. \n3. **Victory Condition**: The goal is to eliminate all boxes, currently, there are green boxes and blue boxes present, while the surrounding holes pose a risk if approached incorrectly.\n\n### Optimal Move Selection:\nTo begin, the best action is to move your avatar up to (7, 5). Moving upwards is viable as it brings you closer to multiple boxes and potentially sets up for further moves next turn.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move places you in a better position to interact with the boxes while avoiding the holes below. I expect to see new strategic possibilities arise with boxes that can be manipulated next turn."
