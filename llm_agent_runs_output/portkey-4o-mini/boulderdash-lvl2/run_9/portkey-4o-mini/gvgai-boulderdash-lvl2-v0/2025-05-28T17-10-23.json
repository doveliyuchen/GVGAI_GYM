Direct interactions with these enemies should be avoided if possible, as they can decrease the avatar's score or health.\n\n### Strategic Move:\nSince I can either move left or up from my current position, moving up leads to a dirt square that can potentially lead to more clear pathways or resources.

The objective is to collect diamonds while avoiding enemies and eventually reach the exit door located at (row=11, col=20).\n\n**Current State Observations:**\n- The avatar is surrounded by various elements, notably:\n  - Diamonds are present at positions (2,2), (2,11), (3,2), (3,6), (4,2), (4,23), (4,24), (5,2), (7,19), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,14), (9,15), (11,5), and others.\n  - Enemies (like butterflies and crabs) can potentially harm the avatar or decrease score.\n  - The immediate vicinity is primarily dirt, which can be cleared, and the boulders that may obstruct movement.\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. **Collect Diamonds**: The closest diamonds are at (3, 2) and (3, 6). The avatar can move left to  (3, 19) to potentially collect nearby resources. \n2. **Avoid Enemies**: An enemy crab is located at (8, 22); we need to navigate carefully around this enemy to avoid losing spirit points.\n\n**Action Decision**:\nGiven the current position of the avatar (3,20) and our desire to collect diamonds while avoiding immediate threats, it is prudent to move **left** to (3,19), as it doesn't immediately put us closer to any enemies or traps, and keeps the pathway to more diamonds clear.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action allows us to reposition closer towards the diamonds located at (3, 2) and evaluate the next move. The expectation is that this aligns with our strategy of collecting resources while maintaining a safe distance from enemies."

Avoiding it is crucial to prevent losing score and health.\n- **Exit**: The exit door ('*') is located at (11, 20), which requires navigating down towards that row while collecting diamonds safely.\n\n### Strategy going forward:\n- **Route Planning**: To prioritize diamond collection while safely navigating towards the exit, I can utilize the dirt and boulders to create paths and block potential enemy threats.\n- **Immediate Action**: The avatar is in a position where moving down can lead towards diamonds and closer to the exit. Since moving downwards would place the avatar closer to the next resource diamond located at (4, 2) and provide safer pathways, I\u2019ll choose to move down.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will execute the action to move down:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move aims to position the avatar towards accessible diamonds while keeping an eye on threats.

The exit door is located at (11, 20), and to win the game, you need to collect at least 9 diamonds while avoiding enemies that can deplete your avatar's health.\n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n1. Immediately available actions from the current position (5, 19):\n   - **Left (5, 18)**: There is dirt '&', which can be cleared with the sword.\n   - **Right (5, 20)**: There is an empty space '.'.\n   - **Up (4, 19)**: There is a wall 'b'.\n   - **Down (6, 19)**: There is a boulder '@'.\n\n2. The nearest diamond that is visible is at (4, 2) or (3, 2), and (5, 2). To collect diamonds, you may need to clear paths and navigate around obstacles effectively.\n\n3. Currently, you have access to a few routes. The more strategic action would be to clear the dirt immediately to create opportunities for movement and exploration.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nTo begin improving the state for diamond collection and greater exploration, I suggest:\n\n```Action: 1 ```\nThis action will utilize the sword to clear the dirt ('&') directly to the left of your avatar. This aligns with the strategy of resource collection and also creates more space for further movement."
