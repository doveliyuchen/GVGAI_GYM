Additionally, I need to be aware of the presence of a butterfly at (4, 8) and a crab at (8, 20).\n\n### Analyzing Opportunities:\n1. **Collect Diamonds**: Several diamonds are within reach. Collecting them would be beneficial for scoring.\n2. **Avoid Enemies**: The butterfly is nearby at (4, 8). If I approach this area, I need to interact or avoid combat. Meanwhile, the crab at (8, 20) is further away but needs attention.\n   \n### Immediate Moves:\nFrom my current position at (4, 22), moving left towards (4, 21) is an option. However, based on the strategy, I should avoid unnecessary movement towards the wall and prioritize collecting diamonds without excessive rotation, especially considering that no immediate diamond exists to the left.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nI should consider moving **down** towards (5, 22), where I have options to move further. This movement won't keep me close to any enemies without the need for confrontation, and I might find more diamonds.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nMoving down will provide a clearer path to my next moves while keeping distance from the nearby enemies and ensuring stillness in progress. I expect this aligns well with the strategy to collect resources carefully while managing risks from enemy sprites."

Moreover, by moving left, I can explore more of the level possibly leading to collectibles or the exit.\n\nExecuting the movement left:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left opens up further options and continues progress toward exploring the level."

Currently, we need to be conscious of our diamond count as we must not exceed 9 diamonds before reaching the exit.\n- **Enemies**: There is at least one crab (`$`) located at **(1, 21)** and one butterfly (`#`) at **(4, 8)**. We must avoid contact with these enemies to prevent losing lives.\n- **Exit Door**: The exit door (`*`) is at position **(11, 20)**.\n\n### Strategy Review:\n1. **Movement Options**: The options at hand are primarily movement actions to either left, right, up, or down.\n2. **Position Stability Check**: Since the avatar's position hasn't changed since the previous move, we need to advance toward maximizing our chances of reaching collectibles while also considering threatening entities.\n3. **Evaluating Movement**: Moving up will position the avatar at **(8, 19)**, which is clear of enemies and can have potential diamonds. \n\n### Proposed Action:\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis actions moves up to (8, 19) keeping a safe distance from threats and exploring the area for potential diamond collection. It's consistent with our strategy of avoiding enemies while enabling us to gather resources efficiently."
