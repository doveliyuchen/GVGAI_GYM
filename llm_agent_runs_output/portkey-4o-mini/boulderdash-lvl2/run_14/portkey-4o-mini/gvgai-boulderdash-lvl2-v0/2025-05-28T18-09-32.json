This allows you to safely navigate the environment while getting closer to collecting more diamonds if desired.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will allow you to reposition without engaging with the crab, aligning with the winning strategy of collecting diamonds while managing enemy encounters."

However, at (4, 10), there's a butterfly (enemy).\n4. **Exit Condition:** The target is to reach the exit at (11, 20) with less than 9 diamonds.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed, I will consider collecting additional diamonds before advancing towards the exit. The best action from the current position that adheres to the strategy of carefully managing diamond collection is to collect the diamond directly above.\n\n### Action:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nI expect this action to successfully collect the diamond above while keeping track of my diamond count, which is currently not stated but can be inferred as under the limit.

The key strategy here is to start collecting diamonds while avoiding the butterfly at position (4,10), which could harm the avatar.\n\nGiven that our avatar starts at (4,11) and can theoretically only move to the left where a butterfly is close by, we could either engage the butterfly with our sword or attempt to navigate around it. However, since there's a diamond accessible to the left (4,10) but also a risk of getting hurt, the action should focus on dealing with the butterfly first.\n\nLet's use the sword to engage the butterfly:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will eliminate the threat, allowing further exploration and collection of diamonds in subsequent turns without losing health. After this, I expect to make progress towards collecting diamonds safely."
