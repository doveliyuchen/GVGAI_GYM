In the recent game state, there are various diamonds ('%') and a butterfly ('#') nearby, with the exit door ('*') located at (11, 20).\n\n### Strategy Recap\nSince the objective is to collect diamonds while ensuring you have fewer than 9 when reaching the exit, I need to navigate towards more diamonds while considering potential enemies and obstacles in my path.\n\n1. **Immediate Position Analysis**:\n   - Diamonds are available at (2, 2), (2, 11), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 18), (4, 2), (4, 23), (5, 2), (5, 23), (7, 19), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 14), and (9, 19).\n   - The butterfly is at (4, 10) which may pose a risk, but it could also be avoided.\n\n2. **Current Diamond Count**: I have not previously collected any diamonds, since it wasn't stated. The strategy emphasizes careful collection while not exceeding the threshold before reaching the door.\n\n### Next Action\nGiven that I want to explore and collect possible diamonds without engaging with enemies, I'll first check if I can move to a spot that offers direct access to diamonds without being hindered.\n\nMoving **Left** may expose me to new paths or options:\n1. **Current Action**: Move Left to (3, 21).\n\nI will proceed with this action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left will keep me safe while allowing exploration towards diamonds, and I hope to discover more about the surrounding paths to maximize my collections."

However, I need to manage my diamond count to ensure I'm below 9 when I approach the exit.\n\n### Next Moves\nGiven that the avatar's position has not changed since the last move, I should consider either moving left or up to explore further while keeping target diamonds in mind.\n\n### Decision\nI choose to move **up** to (10, 20).

Observing the sprite mapping:\n   - There's valuable information gathered from diamonds (noted with `%`) and obstacles (walls and dirt).\n   - The closest diamond is at (10, 5) and (4, 2), which are quite far from the current position.\n   - Enemies are also a threat; the position (11, 14) has a crab noted with `$`.\n\n3. Win and Resource Management:\n   - You currently need to maintain the diamond collection under 9 to reach the exit effectively. Planning is crucial to avoid defeating enemies unnecessarily or exceeding the diamond collection limit.\n\nGiven these factors, I suggest the next action would be to move the avatar to the left into (11, 19).

The strategy would thus be to maximize diamond gathering while avoiding any encounters with the butterfly.\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. **Stay Put**: No immediate action towards resources or enemies (ACTION_NIL).\n2. **Use Sword**: Attempt to interact with enemies (ACTION_USE), but requires positioning correctly and verifying viable targets.\n3. **Movement Options**: You can move left, right, up, or down.
