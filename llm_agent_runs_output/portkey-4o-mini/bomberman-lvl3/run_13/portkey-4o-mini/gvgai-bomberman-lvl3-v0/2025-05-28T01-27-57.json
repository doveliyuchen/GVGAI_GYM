The layout also shows that there are several walls ('*') blocking potential paths.\n\n### Action Decision\nThe current safest and most strategic move would be to utilize the bombs to clear a path towards the goal while managing the enemy threats. Therefore, I will place a bomb at (7, 19) to potentially kill or disable the bat at (7, 5) and clear the way upwards.\n\n### Expected Move\nPlacing a bomb is a necessary move to prepare for a clearer route and manage the enemies at hand.\n\nChoosing the action to place the bomb: \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nFeedback: I expect this action to create an area of effect that can eliminate nearby threats, thus providing a safer route towards the goal in the next turn."

To progress towards the goal while managing enemies, using bombs strategically will be crucial.\n\nGiven that attempting to move left or down would put me in danger of encountering the bat directly, my most prudent move is to use a bomb to eliminate an enemy or clear a path.

The bat at (7, 4) poses an immediate threat.\n2. **Path to Goal**: The goal is significantly far and involves navigating through destructible walls ('b') and avoidable enemies.\n3. **Bombs and Safety**: The avatar does not appear to need to place bombs immediately but should aim to avoid threats, especially the bats.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nSince the avatar cannot move towards the goal without encountering a bat directly above at (7, 4), and the avatar's position may be compromised, a reasonable action could be to attempt to change the position to create better maneuvering options.\n\nGiven these facts, I will make a movement to the **LEFT** to (7, 17), potentially avoiding the bat's immediate attack pattern and keeping options for future moves to get closer to pathways leading to the goal.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is intended to assess the situation further by improving positioning and avoiding immediate risks, while observing how enemies react next."
