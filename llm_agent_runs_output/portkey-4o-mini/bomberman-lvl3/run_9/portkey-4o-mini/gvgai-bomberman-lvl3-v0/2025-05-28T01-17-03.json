Let's try:\n- Move **UP** to (row=6, col=18) to avoid immediate danger and reassess further movements.\n\nHere is the action:\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to create some distance between myself and the enemies while positioning towards the walls further up, providing options for movement or bomb usage in future turns."

The closest breakable wall to my position is at (1, 6) and (1, 12). \n\n### Suggested Action:\n1. **Evaluate Movement**: Since the position of the avatar does not change if I just move left or right, I would need to check the rotation first.\n2. **Use Bomb**: I will place a bomb at (1, 6) to break down one of the walls, allowing for a potential path towards the goal as well as to eliminate the nearby enemies.\n\nBased on my analysis, it\u2019s essential to act strategically in using the bombs effectively to create paths, so the next action will be to use a bomb.\n\n```Action: 1```\n\nThis action should change the state by breaking down the wall and potentially killing the enemies nearby, enhancing my chances to reach the goal effectively."
