The scorpion is positioned at (4, 12) and a spider at (4, 11). These enemies can pose a threat if the player moves too close to them.\n2. **Adjacent Positioning**: The bomberman is currently not directly adjacent to any enemies. However, the closest enemy at (3, 3) is 4 steps away vertically, and there are barriers in the way (breakable walls at (6, 6) and (3, 6)).\n3. **Goal Location**: The ultimate goal is to reach (2, 5). To do so, paths must be cleared, and enemies managed.\n\n### Strategy Application\nGiven the outlined strategy:\n- The focus is on avoiding enemy attacks while strategically using bombs to clear pathways.\n- The next steps should ideally focus on either moving towards the goal or strategically placing bombs to clear obstacles or defeat enemies.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven that the bomberman has not yet moved and is at (7, 17):\n- The first step could be to explore the immediate surrounding area by moving one space down (to (7, 18)), which might reveal further opportunities or threats.\n\n``` Action:4 ```  \nI've chosen to move downwards, anticipating a clearer view of the surroundings and potential paths towards the goal. This aligns with the strategy of carefully progressing within the maze while keeping an eye on enemies."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state and determine the best action, let's first identify the avatar's position. The avatar (denoted as '#') is located at (7, 17). \n\nFrom the given map and rules:\n- Our goal is represented by '$' and is located at (2, 5).\n- There are obstacles (walls '*'), enemies (bats '@', spiders '&', scorpions '%'), and breakable walls ('b') that we can interact with using bombs.\n\nThe immediate area around the avatar reveals the following positions:\n- (7, 16): 'k' (which I assume is some kind of bomb or trap).\n- (7, 18): '.' (open space).\n- (7, 17): '#' (our avatar).\n- (7, 19): '*' (wall, obstacle).\n\nSince the position of the avatar has not changed, and it is crucial to progress towards the goal and also avoid potential threats:\n1. There are potential threats nearby (bats @ at (5, 3) and (3, 3)).\n2. Direct paths to the goal (2, 5) are blocked by walls and enemies.\n\nConsidering the movement rules, I will try to move left to (7, 16). Given that it's a 'k', I can further analyze this position for a safe action choice.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nI expect moving left to (7, 16) to allow me to examine any possible bomb that can assist me in framing a path toward the goal ($ at (2, 5))."
