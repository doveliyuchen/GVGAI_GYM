Since the avatar is currently at (4, 9), the potential actions should consider the nearby wall breaks and enemy positions.\n\nIn the previous state, if our position did not change and if the last action did not result in movement, we should rotate and then attempt to move. \n\n### Current Analysis:\n- Considering the Bomberman is surrounded by a few wall breaks (b), we could potentially eliminate the wall to clear a path to the goal.\n- Since (4, 9) has a wall break directly below at (5, 9), it makes sense to utilize this to continue making progress toward the goal while keeping an eye on the enemies.\n\nThe action chosen will be to **use a bomb on the wall break** at (5, 9) to potentially clear the path downwards while also considering future moves toward our goal. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is aimed at clearing a way through the wall to give us more movement options, aligning with the strategy of exploring and creating safe paths before progressing directly to the goal."

The Bomberman has bombs (indicated by the letter g and s in the mapping) to destroy obstacles along the way.\n\nThe first step should focus on placing bombs strategically to clear the path and eliminate immediate threats. The closest wall that could be destroyed is at (1, 6) to create pathways for movement.\n\nI will proceed with a logical strategy to first check the surroundings and plan my next move. Since my position remains unchanged, I should first consider placing a bomb to clear the wall directly to my left or strategizing to move toward the right where I have a nearby breakable wall `b` at (5,10).\n\n### Planned Action\nThe following action appears beneficial:\n\n``` Action: ACTION_USE ```\nThis action indicates placing a bomb at my current location (4, 9) to break the wall at (5, 10) next turn and secure my advancement towards the goal.
