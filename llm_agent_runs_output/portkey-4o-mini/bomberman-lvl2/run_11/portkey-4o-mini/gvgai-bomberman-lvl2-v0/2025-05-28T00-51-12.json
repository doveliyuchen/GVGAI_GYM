It\u2019s empty (.) and does not pose an immediate threat.\n- **Down to (5, 10)**: This is also valid and empty (.), similar to the Up move.\n- **Left to (4, 9)**: This is empty as well (.) but doesn't really progress towards the goal.\n- **Right to (4, 11)**: This action will land you on the goal (which is actually at (1, 11)), but it isn't the immediate direction from the current position since there are walls up.\n- **Using Bombs**: Not needed immediately as there are no walls directly in the way.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving up to (3, 10) gives you more options for your next move while avoiding enemies in the vicinity.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\nThis action is expected to provide a clear path towards the goal without immediate risk from enemies.
