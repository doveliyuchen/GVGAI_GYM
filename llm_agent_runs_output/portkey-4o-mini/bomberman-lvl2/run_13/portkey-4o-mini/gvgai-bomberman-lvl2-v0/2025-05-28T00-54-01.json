The paths around your current position seem relatively clear except above and directly left where bombs and enemies may be present.\n3. **Walls**: There are destructible walls 'b' and indestructible walls in the surrounding area, which offer potential for bomb placement.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nGiven the strategies that revolve around managing enemies, bomb placement for breaking walls, and navigating to the goal, the immediate next step should be to evaluate action options:\n\n- **Moving Left (to (5, 8)) or Right (to (5, 10))**: Both actions will simply move towards clear spaces but may not enhance your position to reach the goal or eliminate threats.\n- **Use of Bomb**: The bomb 'I' could be useful in destroying some wallBreaks or damaging enemies directly.\n\n### Deciding the Action:\nSince we want to obtain maximum strategy utility and position improvement, I will choose to **use the bomb** to aim for wallBreaks nearby and potentially open up a path forward.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing the bomb is a strategic choice to clear a path and facilitate movement towards the goal while gaining additional bombs or points. I expect this action aligns well with trying to reach the goal and handle nearby threats effectively."

Currently, the nearest WallBreak is at (4, 1) and (4, 3); both are destructible walls that can provide paths or additional resources if destroyed.\n\nSince I am currently in a position where the enemy is nearby (at (5, 5)), and considering the game mechanics, I need to act to minimize risks from that spider while setting up for future moves.\n\nI will first rotate and move DOWN to (6, 9).
