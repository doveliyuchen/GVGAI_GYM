Your main objective is to reach the goal at (row=1, col=11).\n2. Remove obstacles using bombs while avoiding enemies.\n3. Since your position hasn\u2019t changed, it's essential to act, and in this case, you can utilize the bomb at (row=4, col=8) to break the wall next to you.\n\n### Action Selection:\nUsing action `ACTION_USE` (1) to place a bomb at the wall immediately to your left (row=4, col=8) can help you break through. Following this, we'll need to navigate towards the goal, taking care to avoid any subsequent enemy movements.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nThis action will effectively clear a path while ensuring that the strategy remains focused on reaching the goal and managing enemy interactions efficiently."
