If he gets too close, it could lead to a game loss if he catches the avatar.\n\n### Available Actions Based on Movement Options:\n- As the avatar is surrounded by walls on the left, I cannot move left. But I can consider moving UP or DOWN.\n\n1. **ACTION_UP** (to (7, 4)): Would allow movement upwards and possible interaction.\n2. **ACTION_DOWN** (to (9, 4)): Would move downwards and likely lead to further exploration or potential interaction after examining that row.\n\nGiven the objective of prioritizing interactions with the \"annoyed\" sprites and avoiding \"george\", I suggest:\n\n``` \nAction: 4  // Move DOWN\n```\n\n### Feedback on the Action:\nMoving down gives the avatar the potential to navigate the environment better while keeping some distance from \"george\" in case he starts moving up towards the avatar's last position. This is in line with the strategy of avoiding direct encounters with \"george\" while making optimal progress towards converting \"annoyed\" sprites into \"quiet\" ones."

Moving up would lead directly into 'george', which is a loss condition straight away.\n\n3. **Target NPCs**:\n   - There are multiple 'annoyed' sprites nearby that could potentially be transformed to 'quiet' for point gain if the avatar can reach them.\n\n### Recommended Action\nGiven that moving up is not viable, I will move **LEFT** (action 2) to (9, 2):\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\n### Feedback on Action\nThis action aims to strategically reposition the avatar while avoiding direct confrontation with 'george'. It opens up the potential to interact with any nearby 'annoyed' or empty spaces in the following turns, setting up for future moves that enhance the likelihood of success. I expect to evaluate new positions and continue considering movement options based on further sprite interactions."

The closest \"george\" (enemy) is at (row 6, col 3) and (row 7, col 4), which are more than 2 moves away from the avatar.\n\n2. **NPC Management**: \n   - The \"annoyed\" sprites at (row 5, col 1), (row 5, col 2), (row 8, col 2), and (row 8, col 3) present an opportunity for interaction. Transforming them into \"quiet\" sprites will help increase our score.\n\n### Proposed Action\nTo start interacting with the \"annoyed\" sprites, I will move up to (row 8, col 2) and transform it.\n\nThe action corresponding to moving up is:\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\n### Feedback on Action\nI expect this action to be beneficial, as it places the avatar strategically closer to the \"annoyed\" sprite (row 8, col 2), allowing for an interaction (transforming it into a quiet sprite) on the next turn. This aligns with the overall strategy of focusing on transforming NPCs to accumulate points while avoiding conflicts with \"george.\""

There are also numerous walls ('$') present in the environment. \n\nConsidering the strategy previously outlined, the immediate objective should be to increase the score by interacting with the \"annoyed\" sprites and maintaining a safe distance from \"george\" and any potential threats. Since the avatar is situated near a \"quiet\" sprite and has room to navigate, a logical action to take would be to move **up** to row 7, column 2 or manipulate an \"annoyed\" sprite nearby.\n\nHowever, it occurs to me that if I attempt to take any action and the avatar's position does not change, I may need to execute a secondary action. To maximize potential score and avoid conflict with \"george\" as much as possible, I will first try to move **up** into row 7, column 2, as this could potentially lead to a transformation of either a sprite or a positional advantage.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nMoving up to row 7, column 2 should allow me to evaluate the situation better and prepare for subsequent interactions. I expect this action will align with the strategic approach of managing NPC states (transforming any \"annoyed\" sprites) while remaining cautious of any enemies present."
