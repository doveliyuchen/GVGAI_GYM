The goal is to manage the interaction with the chaser and quiet sprites carefully, ideally transforming George to reduce threat levels and meet win conditions.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Assess Character Locations**: The two chasers are directly below the avatar's position. Moving down could bring the avatar closer to one of the chasers.\n2. **Next Action**: Since the avatar is currently positioned at `(6, 8)`, moving **down** to `(7, 8)` would be strategically sound to approach George and potentially interact with him on the next turn.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the avatar doesn't move for directional actions when in the same relative spot, I will first attempt to rotate downward using `ACTION_DOWN`:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n \nThis choice will rotate the avatar to face downwards.

Based on the mechanics, moving towards an `annoyed` sprite seems like a good option to help transform them into `quiet` sprites.\n\n### Action Decision\nTo efficiently start interacting with the `annoyed` sprites, the best action would be to move vertically towards where there are `annoyed` sprites. \n\nBoth `&` sprites at (4, 18) and (4, 19) are reachable in a few moves. However, as a first action, moving up towards (6, 4) should be a significant step as it keeps forward momentum towards the sprites.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up one position.
