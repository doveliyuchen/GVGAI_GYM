The most optimal current move would be to shift upwards since my goal is higher in the grid.\n\n#### Chosen Action: \n``` \nAction: ACTION_UP \n``` \n\nI expect that moving up will get me closer to my goal while remaining aware of my surroundings and avoiding unnecessary encounters with barrels and walls."

Since there's no wall immediately blocking the avatar, I need to navigate effectively towards the goal.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available space to move. The immediate actions available are to move left, right, up, or down. \n\nIf I choose to move up to (17, 18), that space is empty. Alternatively, moving right will take me to (18, 19), which is also empty. \n\n### Action Plan\nConsidering the vertical movement towards the goal is often useful in platformers, I will aim to move upward. \n\nThus, I will take the action:\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis upward action should bring me closer to navigating toward the goal while keeping in mind to remain wary of any potential hazards."
