Given that there is no immediate escape or progression to the right or up without consequences, we need to consider a move down to explore opportunities.\n\n### Selected Action\nSince moving left is not an option and we need to explore paths that will facilitate our goal of getting closer to (1, 10), moving down makes the most sense.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to lead the avatar towards better navigation options.
