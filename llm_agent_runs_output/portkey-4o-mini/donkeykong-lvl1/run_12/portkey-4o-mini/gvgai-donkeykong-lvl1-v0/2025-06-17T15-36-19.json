The avatar is currently at (18, 9). \n\nFrom the given map:\n- The goal ('#') is located at (1, 10).\n- It seems there are various walls ('%') and other obstacles/barrels around the avatar.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Actions:\n1. Up (Action 5): Would move the avatar to (17, 9), which is a wall.\n2. Down (Action 4): Would move the avatar to (19, 9), which is also a wall.\n3. Left (Action 2): Would move the avatar to (18, 8), which is an empty space ('.').\n4. Right (Action 3): Would move the avatar to (18, 10), which is a wall.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe only action that results in movement is to the left (Action 2) to (18, 8). \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to navigate through the level without immediately hitting a wall, following the strategy of exploring towards the goal efficiently."

The objective is to reach the goal sprite represented by '#', located at (row 1, col 10).\n\nThe surrounding area is comprised of walls ('%'), various barrels (like '$' for tough barrels and '&' for breakable barrels) and other interactive elements. In your immediate vicinity, there are no clear paths to the goal directly as the walls obstruct movement and there are barrels in row 18.\n\n**Action Analysis:**\n1. **Movement:** Your avatar can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) as well as interact with arrows or other sprites.\n2. **Current Position:** Your avatar is currently positioned at two consecutive spots. Movement left would not result in a change if checked, as the position would rotate but stay in the same column.\n3. **Goal Direction:** To reach the goal, you will need to find a path vertically upwards from the current row, potentially navigating through the barrels and avoiding hazards.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n- **Up Move:** Moving 'up' will take your avatar from (18, 8) to (17, 8) if there is an open path above without walls.\n- **Left or Right Actions will be Limited:** Depending on the layout, they may not provide forward progress toward your goal.\n\nAt this point, I recommend moving **up**.\n\n```Action: 5```\nThis action should help with progressing upward toward the next available path as per the strategy of advancing through the environment effectively."

There are no immediate threats nearby, but there are two possible arrows within reach that may be useful for breaking barriers or clearing paths toward reaching the goal located at (row=1, col=10).\n\nTo make a meaningful action in accordance with the strategy, let's evaluate the surrounding sprites:\n\n- Directly above the avatar at (row=17, col=8) and (row=17, col=9) are walls (%), blocking any upward movement.\n- To the left (row=18, col=7) is a barrel ($), possibly capable of interaction or movement.\n- Directly beneath seems to be clear, and moving right leads to an open path.\n\nSince the primary objective is to navigate towards the goal while avoiding hazards and utilizing available resources, it would be reasonable to move right to (row=18, col=10) since it is an empty space.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this movement will successfully advance the position of the avatar toward the goal while maintaining strategic choices for future moves."
