    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my player avatar is located at (5, 22) while the nearest goal is at (2, 46). There are camels located at (4, 1), (5, 22), and (6, 22), which could present a challenge in reaching the goal.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The camels are around my position; specifically, I am currently at (5, 22) and there is another camel at (5, 22) which means I will need to take action.\n- Walls surround various parts of the map, creating barriers that limit movement for both the player and the camels.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo make progress towards my goal (2, 46), I should prioritize moving away from the current camel blockage and toward a more advantageous position. Given that the wall is located on row 5, column 23, moving up is likely to provide a clearer route.\n\nSince my avatar needs to change its position and there is a camel directly occupying the same space, I will move:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move my avatar up to (4, 22), which keeps me clear of the camels and closer to accessing more open space towards my objective."

    "content": "Given the current state, we can analyze the layout of the grid and the surrounding objects to determine a meaningful action.\n\nThe important aspects to note are:\n- The player avatar is located at (5, 22) and is not currently blocked by walls.\n- A \"goal\" is located at (2, 46), which currently cannot be reached directly from our position because of various intervening walls.\n- There are \"camels\" nearby (identified as '@') that pose a risk of reaching the goal first.\n\nThe primary objective is to reach the goal at (2, 46) before any camel does.\n\nTo begin strategizing:\n1. **Movement Options**: We can either move left (col - 1), right (col + 1), up (row - 1), or down (row + 1) from our current position. However, we will need to be cautious of not moving towards the walls.\n\nNext, let\u2019s evaluate the adjacent row (row 5) and see if we can shift upward towards the rows containing the goal without getting blocked:\n\nSince (5, 22) -> (4, 22) is possible and upon analyzing further:\n- Moving to (4, 22), (3, 22), and (2, 22) is valid as well - hence, we need to establish a step.\n\n### Action Plan\nMoving **up** to (4, 22) places us in the right direction because there is no immediate obstacle above us. \n\nLet's take the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move allows us to begin ascending towards the goal while keeping an eye on the camels. I expect it to align with the strategy of progressing towards the goal while avoiding congested spaces nearby."
