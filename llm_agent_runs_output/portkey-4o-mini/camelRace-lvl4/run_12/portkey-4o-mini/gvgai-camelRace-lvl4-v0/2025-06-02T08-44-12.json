I must also keep in mind that camels can be located and may move toward the goal as well, so their positions and movements are crucial. Currently, since my avatar is in a position just one step away from two camels, it is essential for me to move strategically.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n1. **Immediate Position**: To move towards the goal at `(2, 46)`, I should attempt to take steps generally toward the right (along the row) toward the column of the goal.\n2. **Movement Avoidance**: I need to avoid getting blocked by walls (`&`) and make sure I don't collide with the camels as they can cause setbacks.\n3. **Prioritization**: I need to prioritize reaching the `#` goal directly unless obstructed.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince my avatar has not moved yet, I need to make a directional action that gets me closer to the goal. Moving **right** (col 23) toward the goal at col 46 will be a fruitful direction to optimize my strategy.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to move my avatar closer to the goal while remaining aware of the wall obstacles.

Since the goal is only a few spaces away, I need to act quickly and wisely to secure the win by reaching the goal before the camel.\n\nCurrently, my avatar seems to be unblocked, and to move towards the goal, I can either move left or up. However, left (towards column 45) would put me directly in front of a wall at (1, 45).

My main objective is to reach the goal before any camels do, thus I need to move rapidly towards the goal.\n2. Currently, my avatar is positioned such that most immediate movements will need to navigate through a tight space around wall sprites.\n3.
