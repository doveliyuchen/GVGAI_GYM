The strategy we've discussed emphasizes awareness of camel positions, careful pathfinding, and quick reactions to their movement. \n\nThe next step would be to analyze the surrounding tiles to determine a meaningful movement. From (6, 22), the possible directions (based on the environment) are:\n\n- **LEFT (5, 22)**: This position contains a `.` (empty space).\n- **RIGHT (6, 23)**: This position contains a `&` (wall, which is not passable).\n- **UP (5, 22)**: This position contains a `.` (empty space).\n- **DOWN (7, 22)**: This position contains a `.` (empty space).\n\nSince (6, 23) is a wall and cannot be passed, the actions of moving RIGHT are invalid.\n\nI can either go LEFT to (6, 21) or UP to (5, 22). Both lead to empty spaces. However, UP (5, 22) helps move towards the upper part of the grid closer to the goal, while LEFT (6, 21) doesn't bring me closer to the goal whether it provides a better path or not.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action goes UP to (5, 22), moving towards the goal while staying clear of obstacles.
