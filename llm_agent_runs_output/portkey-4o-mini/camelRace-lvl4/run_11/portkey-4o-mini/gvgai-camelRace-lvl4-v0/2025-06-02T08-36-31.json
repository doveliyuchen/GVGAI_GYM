I should aim to move left or right to create a path upward.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nLooking at the nearby positions, I can move left to (5, 15).

Since I need to avoid walls, and positioning is crucial, I should make a move toward the goal while considering the immediate threats.\n\n### Decision\nSince the last action was likely in a direction that didn\u2019t result in movement (as the scenario suggests potential restrictions), I will attempt to move **UP (4)** towards row 4. This way allows me to assess the situation from a higher point while closer to my goal.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should help reposition my avatar toward the upper rows while avoiding the immediate blocks, preparing me for a better move next turn towards the goal."
