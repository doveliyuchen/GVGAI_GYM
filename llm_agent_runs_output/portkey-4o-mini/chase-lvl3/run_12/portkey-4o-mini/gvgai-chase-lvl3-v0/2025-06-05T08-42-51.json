The closest scared sprite is at (1, 1).\n\n### Movement Options\n- Moving **UP** to (0, 2) would not be beneficial since it is a wall.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (2, 2) is optimal because it will allow me to go towards an adjacent scared sprite at (2, 1).\n- Moving **LEFT** to (1, 1) would be beneficial, as it will directly engage with the scared sprite there.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 3) is less optimal since that space currently has a carcass and does not directly interact with any scared sprites.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that moving LEFT to (1, 1) allows interaction with the frightened sprite, I should choose that action.\n\n```Action: 1```\nThis action will allow my avatar to engage the closest scared sprite, aligning with the strategy of eliminating scared sprites to progress towards victory."
