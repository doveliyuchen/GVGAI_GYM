The avatar is surrounded by walls on all sides in the area it currently occupies, meaning it cannot move directly into those spaces adjacent to it.\n2. The strategy involves managing the scared sprites: coordinating their transformation back into angry sprites and ensuring that the avatar avoids contact with any potential threats.\n\n### Immediate Actions\n- **Possible Actions**:\n  - Since the avatar cannot move into walls, the only action available is to either remain stationary or consider the rotations first if intending to look around.\n\nThe next best course of action is to stay in its current position and evaluate whether there are any immediate opportunities to interact with nearby sprites on the next turn. \n\nThus, for the moment, I will take the action that allows for evaluation without moving into potential danger or being ineffective.\n\n``` Action: 0 ```\nThis action keeps the avatar safe while assessing the next moves; I expect to reevaluate the state in the upcoming turn for potential movement options."

Since the only viable movement options are either toward available open spaces or the scared sprites, here's how they look relative to the avatar:\n\n- The scared sprites at (1, 18), (1, 19), and (1, 20) are far; I can\u2019t reach them directly without moving through walls first.

The surrounding area reveals various wall tiles and scared sprites, which you can interact with to meet your game objectives. \n\nTo proceed strategically, we must identify safe movements to interact with the scared sprites while avoiding potential threats from angry sprites. Currently, your avatar has the following immediate options:\n\n- **Up (6, 7)**: This tile is free (.), allowing movement upward.\n- **Down (8, 7)**: This tile is also free (.), allowing movement downward.\n- **Left (7, 6)**: This tile is a wall (#), blocking this direction.\n- **Right (7, 8)**: This tile is a wall (#), blocking this direction.\n\nBoth moving up or down are valid options. However, the top part of the map (around (6, 7)) does not reveal any scared sprites, while moving down (to (8, 7)) allows you to potentially access more free tiles in the next move, as well as keeping an eye on the scared sprites below (at (1, 18 to 1, 23)).\n\nGiven that you haven't moved yet, and to ensure a different action from the last state considered, I will choose to move **downward**.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis move allows your avatar to explore further and stay engaged with the areas containing scared sprites while remaining safe from potential threats.

The immediate area reveals several walls and scared sprites located above (1, 18) to (1, 22). \n\nTo strategize effectively, we need to focus on avoiding contact with any potential angry sprites and manage our movement to achieve the win condition by increasing the population of the scared sprites.\n\nLet's analyze the possible actions:\n\n1. **Left (to (9, 2))**: This would move to an empty tile, but we may need to rotate and check other options.\n2. **Right (to (9, 4))**: This too moves to an empty tile.\n3. **Down (to (10, 3))**: This moves into a wall, blocking progress.\n4. **Up (to (8, 3))**: This moves into an empty tile, allowing exploration.\n\nSince the objectives involve avoiding walls and maximizing shifted sprites, moving **upward** takes your avatar into a less obstructed area with potential to move toward the scared sprites on row 1 in future turns.\n\nFollowing the strategy discussed, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis should allow movement into an area with more options to interact with the scared sprites without the risk of an immediate wall or angry sprite."

As the current position of the avatar is at row 9, column 3 and there are multiple scared sprites located at row 1, columns 18 to 22, we should consider a direction where we can either interact with these sprites or move away from danger.\n\nFirst, let's analyze possible movements:\n1. Move left (column 2): which is empty (.), but does not aid in progress.\n2. Move right (column 4): which is also empty (.).\n3. Move down (row 10, column 3): which is a wall (#), so cannot move there.\n4. Move up (row 8, column 3): which is empty (.), but also does not contribute to our main objectives.\n\nSince both the left and right actions lead to empty spaces, we might make a move in a different direction to change our state. Since moving right (to an empty space at column 4) seems equally valid as moving left (to an empty space at column 2), we can go right. \n\nLet's execute the right movement.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action allows us to explore the area while keeping our avatar away from angry sprites, setting up future transformations or interactions with the scared sprites."
