There are several 'scared' sprites (@) nearby, specifically at positions (2, 22), (3, 22), (8, 22), and (9, 22). \n\nConsidering the strategy, your primary goal is to transform 'scared' sprites into 'carcasses.' Since there is a 'carcass' ($) currently at position (9, 1), it can be beneficial to establish routes to the 'scared' sprites while maneuvering carefully to avoid being caught by an 'angry' sprite (which we currently have no information about its position).\n\n### Current Options:\n\n1. The available actions based on your current position are:\n   - Move UP (to (4, 1))\n   - Move DOWN (to (6, 1))\n   - Move LEFT (to (5, 0); which is a wall and cannot be done)\n   - Move RIGHT (to (5, 2))\n\nMoving UP or DOWN could provide paths towards the sprite targets or lead you into opportunities to transform them. \n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo start, I suggest moving DOWN to (6, 1). This direction allows you to access more options towards nearby 'scared' sprites in the next turn while maintaining the ability to retreat or evade potential threats.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move the avatar downwards and I expect to see it keep me in the zone where I can effectively manipulate the sprites."
