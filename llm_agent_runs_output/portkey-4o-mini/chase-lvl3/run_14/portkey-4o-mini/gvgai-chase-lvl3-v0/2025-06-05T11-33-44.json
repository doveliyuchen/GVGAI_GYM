We don't have knowledge of the Angry Sprite's current position\u2014if it's nearby, it should influence our next move.\n\n### Potential Actions\nGiven the avatar's position and the obstacles:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT** (to (9, 3)): This is a clear path as (9, 3) is a '.'.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT** (to (9, 5)): This is also a clear path as (9, 5) is a '.'.\n3. **ACTION_UP** (to (8, 4)): This is a clear path as (8, 4) is a '#', so it's blocked.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN** (to (10, 4)): This is a clear path as (10, 4) is also blocked by '#'.\n\n### Action Selection\nTo maximize the ability to interact with the scared sprites, moving left or right is favorable. However, the chosen movement should consider potential sprite movements in future turns.\n\nIn this case:\n- Moving **left** (to (9, 3)) opens more pathways (still '.' ahead to (9,2)).\n- Moving **right** (to (9, 5)) maintains the game flow and could leverage movement into advantageous positions next to more scared sprites.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose to move **left** to (9, 3).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will keep the avatar away from walls and open up opportunities for further movement and actions towards the scared sprites. My expectation is to have more maneuvering options next turn while avoiding potential threats."

Since neither of these actions will cause the avatar to move vertically (which would be blocked by walls), I will analyze both options with respect to the overall strategy outlined previously:\n\n- **Moving Left (row=7, col=3)**: This direction has no significant benefits, as it moves towards less valuable territory and away from the scared sprites in row 1.\n- **Moving Right (row=7, col=5)**: This opens up space for further navigation and exploration of the area, potentially leading towards other sprites.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo make the most strategic choice, I will move my avatar to the right (row=7, col=5) utilizing the action provided, allowing for exploration and potentially leading towards the direction of the Scared Sprites.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis movement is expected to put me in an open area, providing better options for future actions and enabling closer encounters with the Scared Sprites to meet the objective."

The goal is to eliminate all Scared Sprites while avoiding encounters with potential threats (like the Angry Sprite, which is not currently indicated in our view).\n2. The avatar's movement should aim toward the vicinity of the Scared Sprites while maintaining a safe distance.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **Moving Up (to row=3, col=3)**: This space is empty. This move maintains a distance from the scared sprites but does not bring closer to them.\n- **Moving Down (to row=5, col=3)**: This space is also empty. Not targeting the sprites.\n- **Moving Left (to row=4, col=2)**: This space is empty. Also not targeting the sprites.\n- **Moving Right (to row=4, col=4)**: This space is empty. Not bringing the avatar closer to the goal either.\n\nGiven that the objective is to eliminate the Scared Sprites shift our strategy considering movement towards the left, as we have some empty spaces around our avatar without a direct proximity to walls. However, it doesn't help us move closer to the Scared Sprites yet.\n\nAt this stage, the avatar should analyze the overall map to find a potential different pathway since our actions previously yielded no movement.\nMaintaining the parameters for the next round, I would suggest moving **upwards** to assess potential adjacent movements more thoroughly towards the Scared Sprites vertical alignment.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aims to shift to (row=3, col=3) and will give us a better viewpoint of the available routes and overall interactions. I'm expecting to analyze further where we can make informed decisions in the next step towards reaching the Scared Sprites."

Additionally, moving up allows for closer access to the Scared Sprite at (2, 22), which I can potentially influence or eliminate next turn.\n\nGiven the need to act differently since my position does not change, I will execute the **upward move** to (2, 10).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move is expected to position me closer to more pathways leading to Scared Sprites, allowing for more strategic opportunities while maintaining a safe distance from walls and potential threats."

Movement in this direction may not yield further strategic advantages as it does not bring the avatar closer to the Scared Sprites.\n  \n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2, 23)**: This action would put the avatar into a wall (col 23 is '#'), which is not allowed.\n  \n- **ACTION_DOWN (3, 22)**: Moving down leads the avatar to row 10, which is also occupied entirely by walls ('#'). This action would not be successful.\n  \n- **ACTION_UP (8, 22)**: This potential movement would move the avatar to (8, 22), revealing another empty space ('.'), which may allow for future movement but does not impact the main goal of dealing with the Scared Sprites immediately.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\nAs per the strategy discussed, the main goal is to eliminate the Scared Sprites. The most efficient move would involve positioning the goat to interact with the scared sprites or move toward the carcass if available. Since significant interaction with the scared sprites is present in row 1, we need to reach there from our current position while avoiding encounters with the Angry Sprite.\n\nIn considering all possible actions and their consequences, the best move now would be to avoid wall collisions and open opportunities for future interactions with the Scared Sprites.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nTo keep on course with the strategy and ensure progress, I suggest:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar up to (8, 22), opening potential paths to eventually maneuver toward the scared sprites in row 1. The expectation is to position strategically for future actions without immediately encountering an Angry Sprite or a wall."

The goat is situated at (9, 22) and is currently surrounded by walls on rows 0 to 10 and columns that primarily contain ground or walls.\n2. The closest scared sprite is at (1, 1), which is quite far vertically from the goat.\n3.

There are no immediate threats (Angry Sprites) directly adjacent to the avatar's position.\n- **Nearby Objects**: There is one carcass ('$') located at (9, 22), directly below the avatar. \n- **Scared Sprites Position**: The Scared Sprites ('@') are positioned at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4).

There are walls '#' acting as barriers throughout the layout, and a carcass ('$') at row 9, column 22, which could potentially be used to influence the Scared Sprites.\n\n### Objective and Strategy Alignment\nAs per the strategy mentioned, I need to be mindful of my positioning to avoid contact with any Angry Sprites while I maneuver towards the Scared Sprites. Since no Angry Sprite presence is noted in the immediate context of the current row, I can focus on safely navigating towards the Scared Sprites and considering use of the carcass.\n\n### Possible Actions\n- Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) to row 7, column 20 could help in avoiding walls and bring me closer to a safer path towards the Scared Sprites.\n- Alternatively, I could move right (ACTION_RIGHT), but that will lead into more open space without immediate tactics to engage as the Sprites are above me.\n- Movement up (ACTION_UP) would likely put me in the path of remaining walls, while down (ACTION_DOWN) risks proximity to the carcass.\n\nBased on the above analysis and applying the strategy of analyzing my surroundings, for my next action, I will move left towards column 20 to create a position that may allow future tactical maneuvers onto the path leading up toward the Scared Sprites.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis movement is likely to adhere to the strategies of avoiding direct confrontation and moving strategically toward aligning with Scared Sprites."
