Rotating toward the intended direction may be necessary to effectuate movement.\n\nConsidering the position and strategy:\n1. The Goat should avoid moving left (to (7, 2)) or right (to (7, 4)), as they don\u2019t lead toward Scared sprites.\n2. Moving up (to (6, 3)), or down (to (8, 3)) are valid options, but to avoid confrontation, moving down toward (8, 3) seems favorable.\n\nChoosing to move **down** not only maintains distance from Angry sprites but also positions the Goat to prepare for future actions against the Scared sprites if opportunities arise.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will move the Goat down to position (8, 3), keeping it safe from immediate threats and closer to a clearer strategy for interacting with Scared sprites later on."

Hence, moving down or right may facilitate reaching the terrified sprites.\n\n### Decision on Action:\nCurrently, the position (5, 5) does not change from the previous state; thus, under the game mechanics, I should choose the down action to reach a new row (6, 5). This could potentially connect me to carcasses at (6, 5) while setting up adjacent movements toward transforming any nearby scared sprites.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nAfter moving down, I expect to find a carcass at (6, 5), which will set up my future actions for cultivating more interactions and achieving the win condition."

The avatar has the following potential actions:\n   - Moving left (to (5, 13)), which is an empty space.\n   - Moving right (to (5, 15)), which is also an empty space.\n   - Moving up or down is not possible because both (4, 14) and (6, 14) contain walls (#).\n\nSince I must ensure that my position changes relative to the previous state, and I can only move to adjacent spaces that are not walls, I will first attempt to move left to (5, 13).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to (5, 13) allows me to navigate and set up for a potential interaction with the nearby scared sprites. I expect to evaluate further movements based on the changes in the surroundings."

Since the avatar's last position has not changed, I will analyze the surrounding spaces for potential actions.\n\nThe area around the avatar is as follows:\n- Up (4, 13): an empty space (.)\n- Down (6, 13): an empty space (.)\n- Left (5, 12): an empty space (.)\n- Right (5, 14): an empty space (.)\n\nAll directions are clear with no walls or threats immediately adjacent to the avatar. The objective now is to approach one of the scared sprites to transform them.\n\nSince the nearest scared sprite is directly above the avatar (1, 22), the best plan is to move vertically upwards to increase my chances of getting closer to manipulate one of the scared sprites.\n\nI will move **Up** to (4, 13) to advance toward the row above where there are multiple scared sprites present.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis movement is strategic as it positions me closer to scared sprites, allowing for potential transformation opportunities in the next moves while keeping me safe from immediate threats."

Your immediate surroundings are passable spaces, but you must navigate carefully to avoid the Angry sprites.\n\nTo follow the strategy of manipulating scared sprites, the best course of action is to approach one of the scared sprites. \n\nYour current movement options are:\n1.

Move up to (3, 13)\n\nLooking at the map, moving left to (4, 12) keeps you away from challenges (i.e., Angry sprites), and it puts you one step closer to possibly influencing the scared sprites above you.\n\nHowever, I want to maximize my options. I will move down to (5, 13) since this direction is clear and it still keeps options open for future moves towards the scared sprites while avoiding direct contact with Angry sprites.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nMoving down allows for more maneuverability in subsequent moves towards scared sprites, adhering to the strategy of avoiding confrontations while maintaining potential for transformation of scared sprites."

The avatar can manipulate the scared sprites at (1, 22), (2, 22), (3, 22), and (4, 22).\n3. **Movement Options**:\n   - The avatar can move left (to (5, 12)), right (to (5, 14)), down (to (6, 13)), or up (to (4, 13)).\n   - All movements should be calculated based on avoiding walls and working towards nearby scared sprites.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Moves:\n- **Moving Up (4, 13)**: \n  - This would move the avatar one step closer to scared sprites at (4, 22). However, since there is a carcass at (4, 4), there may be risks that require further navigation.\n  \n- **Moving Down (6, 13)**: \n  - This move also keeps distance from any potential threats and moves towards the carcass at (6, 5). There is potential risk to navigate around subsequent walls.\n  \n- **Moving Left (5, 12)**:\n  - This move keeps the avatar in a relatively safe area but further from the nearest sprite to manipulate.\n  \n- **Moving Right (5, 14)**: \n  - This option leads towards the middle of a wider space but further away from applying strategies to collect scared sprites.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best route considering both safety from angry sprites and the goal of manipulating scared sprites is to **move up** to (4, 13). This allows the player to get close to the scared sprite at (4, 22), potentially setting up a further step next round.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move puts the avatar in a strategic position to convert scared sprites into carcasses in the following turn while keeping a safe distance from threats."

Immediate movement down (to (10, 8)) is blocked by a wall, and moving left would land the avatar directly into one of the Angry sprites (9, 7).\n2. **Objective**: The strategy involves avoiding Angry sprites while manipulating Scared sprites. \n3. **Current Position**: Since the avatar at (9, 8) cannot move left or down, and up will just face the Angry sprite, going right is the only option.\n4. **Adjacent Interaction**: The right position (9, 9) is clear, thus moving in that direction is the best course of action to explore and possibly encounter the Scared sprite at (8, 11) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will allow me to move right into (9, 9), which is a clear space. I expect to establish a safer footing beyond immediate threats and plan to engage with the Scared sprites next turn."

    "content": "To understand the current game state, we analyze the provided map and the avatar's position.  \n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- Your avatar (denoted by 'a') is currently positioned at (row 9, col 9).\n- We can see two angry sprites ('%') located at (row 8, col 9) and (row 9, col 8).\n- There are also scared sprites ('@') at (row 1, col 3) and (row 8, col 12).\n- There is one carcass ('$') at (row 9, col 22).\n  \nThe immediate environment is critical as you are surrounded by angry sprites. Moving directly into any adjacent space that contains an angry sprite (especially moving left to (row 9, col 8) or up to (row 8, col 9)) would result in a loss condition.\n\n### Strategies:\nRecognizing the immediate danger, the best course of action is to either move away from the angry sprites or attempt to maneuver in a way that allows you to next turn to navigate towards the scared sprites.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Left (ACTION_LEFT 1)**: Moves you to (row 9, col 8) - it's unsafe (angry here).\n2. **Right (ACTION_RIGHT 2)**: Would move to (row 9, col 10) - it's clear.\n3. **Down (ACTION_DOWN 3)**: Moves to (row 10, col 9) - it's blocked (wall).\n4. **Up (ACTION_UP 4)**: Would move to (row 8, col 9) - it's unsafe (angry here).\n\n### Choose a Safe Action:\nThe only safe action is to move correctly to the **right**:\n\n```\nAction: 2\n```\nThis action allows you to evade confrontation with the angry sprites and positions you safely for future moves while maintaining gameplay goals of manipulating scared sprites."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar (the Goat, represented by 'a') is located at (row 9, col 10). Surrounding my position, there's an Angry sprite (%), directly to the left at (row 8, col 9), and a Carcass ($) at (row 9, col 22). \n\nTo avoid being caught by the Angry sprite, and to maintain strategic movements, I want to ensure that I do not remain in a position where I'm vulnerable. The best action here is to move away from the Facing Angry sprite while also preparing for future moves that can manipulate Scared sprites.\n\nConsidering my current position and surroundings, moving **Left** (to position (row 9, col 9)), puts me directly adjacent to the Angry sprite. I should instead consider a move that keeps distance while navigating to potentially transform Scared sprites in later turns.\n\nAction **Up** (to position (row 8, col 10)) would avoid the Angry sprite and allow for a better tactical position for future turns, while also possibly avoiding any confrontation with the Scared sprite as well.\n\nThus, I will choose to execute the action:\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action will give me more freedom to maneuver in subsequent turns while keeping out of reach of the Angry sprite."
