Therefore, my strategy should focus on movement to avoid the angry sprite and position myself nearer to scared sprites for a safer future transformation.\n\n### Available Actions Recap\n- **None of the positions above (e.g., (9,5) or (9, 7)) present immediate threats from the angry sprite. Moving left or right could help me escape the immediate danger. I would prefer moving left to (9,5) since it won't put me directly next to targets and will keep me in range vertically to deal with multiple (@) near (5, 22) and (7, 22) when I am ready.**\n\nGiven this logic:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action moves the avatar left to a position (9, 5), avoiding the angry sprite directly in the path and allowing better planning for the next moves toward the scared sprites."

The position of the angry sprite '%' at (8, 5) poses a threat since I need to be cautious of where I move, as it may lead to losing the game.\n\nTo start implementing the strategic suggestions, I should focus on transforming scared sprites into carcasses while avoiding encounters with angry sprites. \n\nNotably, there are scared sprites located nearby:\n- At (5, 1)\n- At (5, 22)\n- At (6, 22)\n- At (8, 22)\n- At (9, 1)\n- At (9, 2)\n\nTo maximize my movement, I should consider moving either left or down to better engage with these scared sprites or to evade the angry sprite. \n\nIf I choose to move down to (10, 5), I would be moving towards walls without making significant progress. However, moving left to (9, 4) does not lead to any immediate risks, thus keeping the avatar safe while allowing for options to engage further.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will take the action to move left to position (9, 4):\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action enables me to reposition safely away from immediate danger while remaining open to further opportunities for engaging with scared sprites according to the strategy."

    "content": "To determine the best action for the avatar, we first need to analyze the current game state based on the provided information. \n\n### Current Details:\n- **Avatar Position**: (9, 4) \n- **Nearby Entities**: \n  - (9, 5) -> Angry sprite ('%')\n  - (9, 3) -> Open space ('.')\n  - Scared sprites are located at (4, 22), (5, 1), (5, 22), (6, 22), (8, 22), (9, 1).\n\n### Objective:\nThe goal is to eliminate all scared sprites while ensuring that the avatar does not come into contact with the angry sprite, which could lead to an immediate loss.\n\n### Current Threats and Opportunities:\n1. **Threats**: The angry sprite at (9, 5) poses a significant threat. If it reaches the avatar, the game will be lost.\n2. **Opportunities**: \n   - The scared sprites present a target that needs to be dealt with.\n   - There is an open space (9, 3) available to potentially reposition away from the angry sprite.\n\n### Action Evaluation:\nWe must act strategically to either eliminate opportunities present with scared sprites or ensure we are moving away from any potential threat. \n\nGiven the immediate threat from the angry sprite, the optimal action is to move left (to position (9, 3)). This keeps the avatar safe from the angry sprite while still allowing for future interactions with the scared sprites.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nBy moving left, I expect to reposition the avatar safely away from the angry sprite while remaining close enough to consider future moves towards scared sprites. This aligns with the strategy of avoiding dangerous encounters."

You need to avoid this sprite, as contact will lead to a loss.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move Away from the Angry Sprite**: The first priority is to evade the angry sprite while keeping an eye on the scared sprites that could potentially be transformed.\n2. **Positioning for Encounters**: After avoiding the angry sprite, you can attempt to move closer to the scared sprite to eliminate it while ensuring you are not closer to the angry sprite.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe best option, given that the immediate area contains an angry sprite, is to move up to (8, 3) to create distance while at the same time looking for opportunities to engage the scared sprites on the next turn.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: Moving up is crucial to avoid the angry sprite on my right, which keeps me safe while I look for the next strategic move."
