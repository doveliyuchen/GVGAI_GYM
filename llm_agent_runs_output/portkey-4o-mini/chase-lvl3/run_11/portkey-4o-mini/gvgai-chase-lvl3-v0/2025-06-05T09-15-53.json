(empty space).\n2. **Down (Action 3)**: Moving to (10, 4) is blocked by walls ('#').\n3. **Left (Action 1)**: Moving to (9, 3) is also permissible as it leads to an empty space ('.').\n4. **Right (Action 2)**: Moving to (9, 5), also leads to an empty space ('.').\n\nChoosing to move **Up** (to (8, 4)) may seem beneficial as it moves towards the top of the grid, where the Scared sprites are located. However, we need to keep in mind that moving closer horizontally (for example to (9, 5) or (9, 3)) might give better positioning as we can follow through to either rows with Scared sprites.\n\nConsidering the overall strategy and the immediate options, I will move **Right (Action 2)** to (9, 5) since it offers a direct path along the row while still enabling potential future moves towards the Scared sprites.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows me to maintain mobility towards the right path and possibly better positions to engage the Scared sprites next turn."

Since you're positioned at (7, 3) and the nearest Scared sprite is at (1, 20), you can safely move towards that sprite.\n2. You are currently far from the Angry sprite, and your immediate moves are safe without immediate threat.\n\nThis suggests that moving vertically down towards the available Scared sprite is the next logical step.\n\n### Move Choice\nTo strategically position yourself for the closest Scared sprite target, I suggest the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\n\nThis moves you down.

There are multiple 'Scared' sprites (`@`) located nearby, specifically at (row=1, col=20), (row=1, col=21), (row=2, col=22), (row=3, col=22), and (row=4, col=22).\n2. The objective of the game is to transform all 'Scared' sprites into 'Carcass' without being caught by the 'Angry' sprite.\n3. Currently, there are no 'Angry' sprites visible on the grid, which means I have some freedom to position myself without immediate danger.\n\nTo achieve the goal, I need to move towards one of the 'Scared' sprites. The closest one is at (row=4, col=22). Moving towards this is a strategic action because:\n\n- It will turn the 'Scared' sprite into a 'Carcass' upon interaction.\n- There are walls surrounding this area, potentially blocking any threat from 'Angry' sprites during my process of transformation.\n\nHowever, my avatar is currently at (7, 4), and to move toward (4, 22), I should first assess if I can get there directly.\n\nMoving upward (towards row 6 and above) and then moving right seems to be the logical path. Since I'm currently positioned at (7, 4), executing a move action upward to (6, 4) will maintain distance from the 'Scared' sprites but position me closer to the initiating moves toward reaching them.\n\n### Action Decision\n- I will move my avatar `UP` (Action 4).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will bring me closer to funneling towards the Scared sprites without immediate threat, managing the route while adhering to strategy."
