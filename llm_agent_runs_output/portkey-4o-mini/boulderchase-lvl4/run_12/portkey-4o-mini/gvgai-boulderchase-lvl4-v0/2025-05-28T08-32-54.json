The goal is to utilize your resources effectively while avoiding enemies.\n\nSince you are currently at (10, 14), you have:\n\n- Rows above you filled with crabs and walls\n- Rows below you have dirt and more resources that could be collected\n\nLet's take a strategic approach. Looking at the locations, you can move:\n\n- Up (10, 14) to (9, 14) \u2192 A dirt field, which doesn't help in terms of immediate scoring but stays safe.\n- Down (10, 14) to (11, 14) \u2192 There are various collectible options near there. \n\nMoving left or right will also put you near diamond locations but could invite traps from surrounding crabs or walls.\n\nTo gather resources quickly, moving down seems to be the best option because it presents opportunities to either collect diamonds near (11, 16) or to access lower areas while staying safe from immediate threats.\n\nThus, I'll proceed with:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action allows me to move downwards to explore diamond collection options while keeping an eye on potential threats from enemies in subsequent turns."

Remember, you need to keep your diamond count at 9 or below.\n2. **Reach the Exit**: Moving toward the exit efficiently, avoiding excessive encounters with enemies, is crucial.\n\n### Action Strategy\n- To effectively develop the current strategy, I'll assess the map:\n  - The map features various enemies (noted as crabs \u2018$\u2019, butterflies \u2018#\u2019, boulders \u2018@\u2019, and diamonds '&' or \u2018x\u2019).\n  - Collisions with walls and other barriers must be minimized, and specific strategic movements around enemies are necessary to maintain resources.\n\nSince jumping actions (up/down) might involve some rotation for directional changes, it\u2019s necessary to ensure your position changes with each action.\n\n### Chosen Action\nI will proceed by taking the first logical action toward a more advantageous position that affords access to diamonds or less immediate threat from enemies. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving downwards is a strategic choice to explore more potential diamond paths or combat opportunities without risking collision with enemies currently seen in the map layout.\n\nThis action is expected to reveal further options while maintaining a diamond count that allows access to the exit."

Moving directly to collect diamonds or defeat enemies.\n2. Evading enemies by utilizing walls or transforming dirt into resources.\n3. Planning a path towards the exit.\n\nSince we want to avoid getting too close to the exit prematurely and can only collect a maximum of 9 diamonds, I notice that moving left towards the boulder might allow strategic movement to control the enemy, but it may also risk getting stuck if not executed properly.\n\nSince the avatar's current position is (11, 14) and does not change from the last state, it's crucial to analyze and take a different action from the last one. Moving left to the boulder might create an opportunity to eliminate the butterfly directly above while keeping the left side open to collect or draw enemy attention away.\n\nThus, I will choose to move the avatar left towards the boulder.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect this action will help maneuver towards the boulder while keeping an eye on the potential collection of diamonds if the boulder is engaged or utilized immediately."

The exit is located at coordinates (3, 0), but we must ensure that we have fewer than 9 diamonds when we reach there.\n3. There are several collectible items and potential threats in the game environment, notably crabs and boulders which can be used against enemies.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Since we need to gather resources while evading enemies, prioritizing the collection of diamonds will involve movement and possibly defeating crabs.\n- Depending on the avatar's initial position (which is unclear), we will need to either move towards a diamond or clear a path towards the exit.\n- If the avatar hasn't moved now, I will attempt to move in a direction where I can access resources or dodge enemies.\n\nAssuming I am starting from a position that allows me to move towards a diamond or an enemy to defeat, I will take the action to move **RIGHT** to see if there are any immediate resources in that direction.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is chosen to explore the right side for potential diamonds and avoid enemies.

Moving left to (10, 14) will allow me to collect a diamond, which adds to my resource count.\n2. It is worth collecting the diamond since it doesn't exceed the limit as it will still have me at or below the threshold of 9 diamonds.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to collect the diamond and move one step closer to the exit, aligning with the strategy of resource management."
