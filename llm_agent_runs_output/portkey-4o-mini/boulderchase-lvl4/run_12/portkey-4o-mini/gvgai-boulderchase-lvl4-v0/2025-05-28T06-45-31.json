Move Up to collect the diamond.\n2. Other movements seem either to lead to walls or toward an enemy.\n\nBased on the strategy and analysis, the most meaningful action here is:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up should effectively assist us in resource collection while keeping us safe from enemy interaction.

The crab could be a threat, but since we need to gather diamonds any interaction with it should be handled carefully.\n2. Moving left will get us closer to the crab, while moving to the right or up would keep us safe. \n\n### Action Decision:\nWe will opt for moving **up** to `(10, 14)` to see if we can create a better strategic position for our next move:\n- It leads us to an empty space, providing options for future moves without immediate confrontation with a crab.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action allows us to stay safe while potentially positioning for a future collection of diamonds. I expect the positioning to provide a clearer strategic advantage next turn."

A more strategic approach would be to first move up or left to dodge the enemy while still getting closer to valuable resources.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nI will choose to move left to (11, 13) where the crab is located.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will result in either engaging the crab or potentially needing to adjust based on the enemy's position after my movement. My expectation is that moving left will allow me to assess further actions, be it engagement or retreat, reflecting flexibility within that turn."
