    "content": "The current position of the avatar ('a') is at (row=6, col=9). In the surrounding area, there are several diamonds ('&'), and there are also boulders ('@') positioned in various directions.\n\nTo strategize effectively:\n\n1. **Resource Management**: I should focus on collecting diamonds while mindful of the cap of fewer than 9 diamonds when reaching the exit.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Since there are boulders nearby, I need to be cautious to avoid being harmed by falling boulders or enemies.\n3. **Enemy Interaction**: There are crabs ('c') in the vicinity; I could exploit them to gather resources but should avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nGiven that my position is stable, I'll look into moving towards the nearest diamond location which is at (row=6, col=8) directly to the left. \n\nThus, I will move left. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to collect a diamond and align with the strategy of resource gathering while staying safe."
