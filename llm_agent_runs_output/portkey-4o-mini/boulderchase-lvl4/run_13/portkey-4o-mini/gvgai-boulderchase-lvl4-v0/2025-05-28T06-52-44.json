However, I should pick actions to explore the possibility of collecting diamonds while avoiding the maximum limit before reaching the exit.\n\nSince positions (10, 11) and (10, 13) are safe, I will prioritize moving the avatar.\n\n### Action Execution\nI will move to the left to (10, 11):\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action keeps the avatar towards explored tiles before potentially pushing boulders while maintaining a safe distance from threats, which aligns well with the strategy to gather diamonds while keeping the score manageable."

My immediate options are to move left to (10, 1), right to (10, 3), up to (9, 2), or down to (11, 2), each of which is walkable. However, moving to (10, 4) isn't an option as it is occupied by an enemy (crab).\n2. It's crucial to avoid the crab at (10, 4) since coming into contact with it may result in score loss.\n\nEvaluating my strategic options while keeping in mind my goal to collect diamonds and avoid enemies:\n- The option to move left (to 10, 1) or right (to 10, 3) would allow me to keep my distance from the enemy and navigate the level more safely.\n- Moving up to (9, 2) is also a good option as it distances me from the crab while keeping me within a range of possible further movements.\n\nConsidering all options, I have decided to **move to the right to (10, 3)**, allowing me to explore the area safely and still maintain a distance from immediate danger.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe action of moving right should lead me to a safe position while allowing further exploration."
