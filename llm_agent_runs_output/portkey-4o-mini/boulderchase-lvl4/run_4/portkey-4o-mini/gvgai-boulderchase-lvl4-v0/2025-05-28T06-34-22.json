Here's a quick summary of the immediate environment around the avatar:\n\n- **Immediate Surroundings:**\n  - Directly below (row 11, col 15) is a wall ('*'), limiting downward movement.\n  - The sword is located at (row 10, col 16), which is to the right of the avatar, followed by a boulder at (row 10, col 17).\n  - There are diamonds at positions (row 10, col 8), (row 10, col 9), and (row 10, col 10).\n  - There are potential threats (enemies) around in various nearby positions.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation:\nTo collect diamonds and navigate through this area effectively based on the strategy provided, particularly:\n- Focus on collecting diamonds.\n- Avoid unnecessary confrontations with enemies.\n- Utilize the sword (which is at (row 10, col 16)) effectively to either collect resources or prepare for enemy encounters.\n\nSince the avatar had no prior movement as the action needs to change the position, I should consider moving to the right where the sword is located so that I can then engage or collect resources more effectively.\n\nGiven this evaluation:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action should move the avatar to the right, allowing access to the sword and providing further options to collect diamonds or deal with enemies effectively next turn.

Currently, at least 9 diamonds are required to access the exit.\n\n### Strategy Alignment:\nBased on the strategies outlined previously:\n- Collect diamonds as a priority to reach the exit condition of needing at least 9 diamonds.\n- Be cautious around boulders to avoid being crushed and instead leverage them to eliminate potential threats.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nThe optimal action right now, given the importance of collecting diamonds, is to move down to (11, 15) which is a safe location beside a boulder. This will allow for better mobility in future turns either to collect diamonds or deal with enemies.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move me down into a safety zone, and I expect to plan my next move more effectively based on the new positioning."
