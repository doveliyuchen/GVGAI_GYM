Keeping in mind the goal of resource management (max 9 diamonds) and avoidance of enemies, it would be best to move in a direction that opens up more pathways toward diamond collection without risk.\n\n### Action Selection\nSince the current position does allow for safer movements without immediate threats, I will choose to move **left** since it does not lead towards any enemies:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left is expected to keep the avatar safe while still exploring the level."

Currently, the avatar does not seem to have any diamonds in possession (as indicated by the absence of any prior collection), so it can move freely.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Objective**: Move towards the exit door to win the game.\n2. **Action**: The most immediate action is to move **left** to (row=10, col=8), where the exit door is located.\n\nThus, I will perform the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to lead directly to winning the game by reaching the exit door."

Collecting a diamond puts me at risk if multiple crabs are close, so I'll proceed with caution.\n\nGiven this information, I will choose to collect the diamond directly left of my avatar, which is at (row=10, col=7).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect to successfully collect the diamond, increasing my score while keeping my overall resource management in mind as I approach the exit."
