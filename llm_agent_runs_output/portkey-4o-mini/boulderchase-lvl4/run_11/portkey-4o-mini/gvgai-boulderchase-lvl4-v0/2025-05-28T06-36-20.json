(no interaction).\n- At (6, 10) \u2013 a background dot '.' (no interaction).\n- At (7, 9) \u2013 another dot '.' (no interaction).\n\nI will proceed to make a movement. Moving left to (6, 8) which is currently clear of enemies can be beneficial for assessing the surrounding area and finding a route toward the nearest diamond, which is at (4, 7). \n\nThus, I will choose the LEFT action as my next move. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow me to assess the area and potentially plan my next moves toward resource collection while remaining safe."

    "content": "Given the current state, it seems your avatar ('a') is located at row 6, column 9 surrounded by some empty spaces and various collectibles. Your nearby resources include several diamonds ('&') and the potential for engaging enemies (like the crabs '$' and butterflies '#').\n\nFirst, let's assess the immediate environment:\n- To the left (row 6, col 8) is a '.' (empty/background tile).\n- To the right (row 6, col 10) is also a '.'.\n- Up (row 5, col 9) contains an '@' (boulder), which may be used to block or push.\n- Down (row 7, col 9) is also a '.'.\n\nNow, considering your avatar's goal is to collect diamonds and ultimately reach the exit (which requires a minimum of 9 diamonds), you can directly evaluate your moves based on immediate opportunities.\n\n### Available Action:\n1. The right move to (row 6, col 10), still being an empty space ('.'), doesn't lead to direct interaction, but it could set up a future play.\n2. Moving left to (row 6, col 8) also is an empty space.\n3. Moving up to (row 5, col 9), which has a boulder, might open further movement potentials involving combat or resource manipulation.\n4. Moving down to (row 7, col 9) keeps options open to navigate through the level without engagement.\n\nGiven the strategies outlined, moving up to interact with the boulder seems to have potential for both resource management and engagement.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will allow my avatar to position optimally and continue strategizing towards resource collection and exit readiness."

    "content": "In the current game state, the avatar is located at (row 6, col 9). The immediate surroundings include a combination of enemies (crabs and butterflies), objects (boulders), and diamonds. To make progress towards winning the game (which requires collecting at least 9 diamonds and reaching the exit door), the next step needs to consider both collecting diamonds and managing potential enemy threats.\n\n1. **Current Surroundings**:\n   - The avatar is positioned amidst several collectibles (diamonds) below.\n   - There are crabs positioned nearby that may pose a threat if engaged.\n   - The surrounding dirt areas allow for movement toward the diamonds.\n\n2. **Next Move Analysis**:\n   - The most strategic move now is to move towards collecting diamonds on the lower rows.\n   - Given that the sapphire limit is 10 and we start the game with only 0, collecting is essential.\n   - The upward and lower space options are available (row 5 and row 7) but will need to avoid direct horizontal confrontations with crabs.\n\nThus, moving **downward** to (row 7, col 9) seems to be the best option, where there are potential diamonds to collect along the column below.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action aims to collect resources while maintaining distance from enemies. I expect to see the avatar either move down to an area with diamonds or encounter further strategy with enemies in the next state."
