Given that there's a path to the exit and finite time, it\u2019s crucial to minimize movements.\n\nSince the avatar\u2019s last action of movement is not specified and you need to initiate movement towards a goal, consider the following:\n\n- **Potential Move**: Pushing the box at (4, 13) into the hole at (4, 4) can be a priority since that\u2019s where your high-scoring holes are located. However, since your avatar is positioned at (5, 5), the first step will be to move towards the box's row.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe quickest path towards the box at (4, 13) is to move up into row 4. \n\nNow, executing the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up one row, placing it closer to the critical set of holes and the box.

However, the closest hole is blocked by the avatar's current position. How to manipulate boxes is key.\n\n2. **Available Immediate Actions**:\n   - Move left (row=5, col=3): which doesn\u2019t immediately help since the surrounding area doesn't have accessible boxes to interact with.\n   - Move right (row=5, col=5): This keeps the path constructive for further potential moves.\n   - Move down (row=6, col=4): This is risky as it could lead to a dead-end/blockage.\n   - Move up (row=4, col=4): This directly accesses the hole (h), but the grid layout shows it already occupied, thus potentially presenting an inability to use the hole.\n\nGiven the above considerations, the most strategic immediate action is to move right to (row=5, col=5). This creates operational options for subsequent turns to manipulate the boxes or interact with holes without immediate obstacle interference.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should keep options open for further maneuvers without immediate constraints on moving towards potential box manipulation or interaction with the exit. I expect to analyze the new position for further decisions based on obstacles and available interactions."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, with the avatar positioned at (5, 5), I need to analyze possible actions.\n\n### Current Position and Surroundings:\n- Avatar (a) is located at (5, 5): \n  - Up (4, 5) -> Empty (.)\n  - Down (6, 5) -> Wall (w)\n  - Left (5, 4) -> Empty (.)\n  - Right (5, 6) -> Empty (.)\n\n### Box Position:\n- There's a box (@) at (2, 11) which can be potentially moved down, but it's not immediately accessible from the avatar's current position.\n\n### Action Path:\n1. The primary goal is to start interacting with boxes to score points. However, the closest box (available for moving) is at (2, 11), and I need to maneuver towards it.\n2. Since the only available moves from the current position are Up, Down, Left, and Right, with the Down direction leading to a wall and nothing immediately close that I can interact with, moving left (5, 4) seems like the best option to progress.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By moving left to (5, 4), I will create an opportunity to continue moving towards the exit or to the box later.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to position (5, 4) creates new possibilities for future moves and brings me closer to potentially manipulating boxes."

    "content": "Given the layout of the current state and your avatar's position at **(row=5, col=4)**, let's analyze the situation:\n\n### Surrounding Elements:\n- Any available movement for the avatar must be through '.' (floor) or a box ('@', '#', '$', '%') that the avatar can manipulate.\n- The immediate surroundings show:\n  - Row 5: (row=5, col=3) is '.' and (row=5, col=5) is '.'.\n  - Row **6**: (row=6, col=4) has '&' (door), but it appears blocked by walls.\n\n### Observations and Moves:\n- Moving **left (to (row=5, col=3))** or moving **right (to (row=5, col=5))** would be possible.\n- If I consider box management, there are boxes to the north at (row=6, col=11) which would not influence my immediate move.\n- The cached actions state clearly indicates that no movement has occurred from the last state.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo maximize points by pushing boxes into holes, it's advisable to ensure I can interact with the boxes effectively. However, immediate boxes are several rows above and to the right. Thus, I should first reposition my avatar.\n\n### Action Choice:\nSince I can move to either direction, I will proceed to move right to (row=5, col=5). This allows me to evaluate the next set of movements more effectively.\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\n\n### Feedback:\nMoving right provides another option for future moves towards empty squares, and I expect to see if we can access more boxes after repositioning, to maintain strategic control towards achieving my objectives."
