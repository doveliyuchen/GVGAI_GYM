In addition, it potentially needs to manage the boxes available to create pathways (place them in holes) or manipulate them in relation to the exit.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Moves\nSince the avatar is at (4, 4) and needs to reach the exit at (7, 13), a movement towards the exit is necessary. The avatar has available actions to move left, right, up, or down.\n\n#### Possible Actions:\n1. **Move Up (ACTION_UP)**: This would take the avatar to (3, 4), but it doesn't provide any strategic advantage towards the exit yet.\n2. **Move Down (ACTION_DOWN)**: This would take the avatar to (5, 4); still does not significantly progress towards the exit.\n3. **Move Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: This would move the avatar to (4, 3), again, not advancing towards the goal.\n4. **Move Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: This would move the avatar to (4, 5), which maintains flexibility for future movements towards either boxes or possible routes to the exit.\n\nConsidering the need to maximize future movement possibilities and leverage available boxes, moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) seems to be the best option to keep progressing towards the exit.\n\n### Conclusion\nI will proceed with the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should help in progressing horizontally closer to the exit while maintaining options to interact with the box and holes soon."
