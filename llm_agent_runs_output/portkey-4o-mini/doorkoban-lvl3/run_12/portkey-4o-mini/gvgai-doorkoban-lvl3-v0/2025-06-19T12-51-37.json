The more advantageous action to get closer towards the exit while interacting with other elements would be to move downwards as it maintains the urgency of approaching the exit in the lower rows.\n\nAfter considering all nearby sprites and the need to move closer to the exit, I will opt for an action that potentially brings me closer to navigating towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action will lead the avatar down to (5, 7), maintaining strategic proximity to the exit while keeping flexibility for subsequent moves."

However, our aim is to assess whether there's any action that involves manipulation of the existing boxes.\n\n**Optimal Action**:  \nMoving `LEFT` is a significant action to reposition the avatar towards potentially moving the box to a hole on the next available turn if needed, since moving in other directions does not provide a strategic advantage at this moment.\n\nTaking this into account, the action will be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nFeedback: I chose `LEFT` to reposition, which might give us the option to push boxes to holes or maneuver towards the exit.

The boxes at (5,13) and (10,4) could potentially be manipulated to fall into holes if the avatar moves towards them first.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most strategic action is to move down to (4,5), which keeps options open for the next move while providing proximity to the holes soon.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to navigate towards more important positioning for future interactions with the boxes and holes.
