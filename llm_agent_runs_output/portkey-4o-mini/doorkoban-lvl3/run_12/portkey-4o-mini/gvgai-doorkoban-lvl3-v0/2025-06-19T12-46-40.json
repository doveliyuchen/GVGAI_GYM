You have one box ('#') at (4, 13), which can be moved to earn points by placing it in a hole if it aligns correctly.\n\n### Strategy Analysis\n- Begin by assessing the paths to move the box at (4, 13) if that is beneficial.\n- Since the hole (h) is at (4, 4), you'll either need to focus on moving the box to a hole or maneuver through empty spaces towards the exit.\n\n### Next Action\nThe best immediate action to take from (5, 5) is to first move **DOWN** to (6, 5), giving you more options to either move right or access to more surroundings. This seems prudent without blocking any moves. Hence, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action should help me evaluate the situation better and open up a path toward the exit."

The avatar needs to navigate to it.\n\n### Choosing the Action\nTo reach `box2`, the avatar should first move downwards.

ACTION_LEFT (move to (4,6)): \n   - This will move the avatar closer to the hole.\n2. ACTION_RIGHT (move to (4,8)): \n   - This will keep the avatar away from the hole.\n3.

Given the proximity of the box to the hole, pushing the box into it will help clear up space and allow for potential scoring.\n\n### Selected Action\nI will move the avatar left to position (4, 6).

Instead, I should consider moving upwards or left to navigate closer to potential holes.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nI will first attempt to move **up** (ACTION_UP) to (row=1, col=7) since this position is clear and would give me more options to figure out further moves toward the exit, while keeping an eye on the boxes' positions.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move allows me to assess further opportunities going forward while keeping the box management in mind, aligning with the overall strategy of planning moves carefully."

Move the avatar left (from (5, 5) to (5, 4)), to assess the surrounding tiles and allow for pushing the box1 that is positioned at (4, 13) towards the hole that is at (4, 4) next.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will reposition the avatar and prepare for future box manipulation, aligning with the strategy of maximizing points while pursuing the exit."

The strategy suggests focusing on box management to maximize points. \n\nAt your current position (5, 4), the next logical move would be to push a box into a hole or toward a hole to eventually score points as you progress toward the exit. You can move up to (4, 4) where the hole is located, potentially allowing you to act on the box at (4, 13) as well in subsequent moves.\n\nNow, I will proceed with the action of moving the avatar up to (4, 4) to reach the hole.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is aimed at positioning the avatar above the hole, allowing for either scoring points through box manipulation or further movement towards the exit on subsequent turns."

You currently can't reach or affect boxes directly from your position, as the nearest box '#' is quite far at (4, 13).\n2. The exit is two rows above your current position at (7, 13), but there's a wall to the left that must be navigated around.\n\nSince the exit is the ultimate goal and given your current position, moving **up (ACTION_UP)** will guide you closer to the exit and open up potential moves subsequently.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThe expectation is that this will progress towards the exit while exploring further options on the next turn."
