The door at (6, 4) might need to be interacted with, but we can't see if any boxes are required to unlock it, or whether it opens directly.\n2. The exit at (7, 13) is directly reachable if we can clear the path to it, and since the holes nearby require specific boxes to score points, efficient box management will be required.\n\nGiven the position of the avatar and the surrounding layout, we can perform an action to move the avatar.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince the avatar is currently at (4, 3) and the goal is to strategize a way toward the exit while also considering box placement, I will move right (to (4, 4)), which is where one of the holes is located.

Since there is a hole directly adjacent right (to (4, 4)), the avatar can consider moving right to (4, 4) into that hole if there were no barriers limiting that movement.
