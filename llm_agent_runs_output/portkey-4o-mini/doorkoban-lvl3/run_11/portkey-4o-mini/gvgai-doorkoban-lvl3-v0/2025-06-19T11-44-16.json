Box '@' is at (9, 2)\n2. Box '#' is at (4, 13)\n3. Box '$' is at (10, 4)\n4. Box '%' is at (11, 8)\n\n**Holes**:\n1. Hole 'h' is at (4, 4)\n2. Hole 'w' is at (10, 11)\n3. Hole 'c' is at (10, 11)\n4. Hole 'f' is at (11, 1)\n\n**Exit**: The exit 'e' is at (7, 13).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. The avatar needs to move towards boxes to push them into their respective holes.\n2. The holes assigned to the boxes will yield a score based on successful box placements.\n3. The exit must be removed from the game, so we need to consider moving boxes accordingly to clear obstacles.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- The closest box to the avatar is actually Box '#' (4, 13). The hole 'h' (4, 4) is also the nearest to this box.\n- However, the exit is (7, 13), and the path may be blocked by walls and doors.\n\n### Next Action Determination:\nFrom the avatar's position, I need to determine whether to interact with Box '#' immediately or reposition to consider another box. \n\nSince the avatar is already adjacent to the hole 'h' while remaining boxed by the walls, I should first rotate to make progress towards the hole directly or check for movement possibilities.\n\nGiven the options available within my surroundings, I will **move UP**, which will potentially put the avatar in a position to assess other available actions better or still make further moves towards the boxes.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis is expected to help reposition closer to holes and boxes while opening new paths for further strategic moves ahead."
