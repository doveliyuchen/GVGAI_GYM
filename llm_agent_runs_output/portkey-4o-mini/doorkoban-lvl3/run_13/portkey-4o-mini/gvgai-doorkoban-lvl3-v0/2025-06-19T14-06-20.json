The goal is to efficiently navigate through the level and deactivate all exit sprites.\n\nFrom my position, I have unobstructed access to the area around me, specifically:\n\n- Row 5, Col 8: Empty space (.)\n- Row 5, Col 10: Empty space (.)\n- Row 6, Col 9: Wall (w)\n\nTo progress toward the exit and to fully utilize the available space, the best action would be to move either left to (row=5, col=8) or right to (row=5, col=10). Both of these will provide access to more empty spaces, allowing for better maneuvering options.\n\nGiven the opportunity to avoid walls and explore further, I choose to move to the left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action allows me to explore more of the level while keeping the option open to push boxes or interact with holes strategically in future moves."

This is a strategic move as it will position the avatar closer to the available boxes, enabling interaction with them to manipulate them for maximum score potential while advancing toward the exit. I expect this action will change the avatar's position, aligning with the goal of moving towards exits and valuable holes."
