First, move towards box '#' at (4, 13), which can be pushed into hole '1' (4, 4).\n2. This action will help start accumulating points as box interactions can yield various points.\n\n### Available Directions:\n- **Left (5,4)**: Open space\n- **Right (5,6)**: Open space\n- **Down (6,5)**: Open space\n- **Up (4,5)**: Open space\n\n### Action Selection:\nMoving **Down (to (6, 5))** is a good choice since it keeps the proximity to box interactions while considering further moves towards openings. \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect this action to maintain openness and lead to boxes, pushing towards interacting with game elements for points, aligning with the planned strategy."

To keep advancing towards the goal, the following opportunities stand out:\n\n- Move **RIGHT** to (4, 5) which is an empty space.\n- Move **LEFT** to (4, 3) which is an empty space.\n- Move **UP** to (3, 4) which is also an empty space.\n- Move **DOWN** to (5, 4) which is again an empty space.\n\nNext, we also observe the position of the adjacent box (4, 13) which is marked as '#'. The strategy suggests maximizing points and utilizing available boxes. However, this box cannot be accessed directly from (4, 4) without navigating left first, as none of the spaces immediately around the avatar can push the box towards a hole since it needs directional movement.\n\n### Strategy Decision\nTo potentially move towards the box at (4, 13), I should take an action that opens up pathways. Let's move **RIGHT** to (4, 5), which allows me to continue evaluating the next moves and also ensures that I don't get stuck.\n\nThis action seems aligned with the strategy to maintain efficient movements, exploring spaces that open up more pathways for future box interactions.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right will place the avatar in a position to decide on further actions, maintaining strategic opportunities to continue towards the goal."
