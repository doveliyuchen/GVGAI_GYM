Moving down is the most straightforward option.\n2. **Hazard Awareness**: Avoid dangerous tiles (gems, especially red '*').\n3. **Key and Exit Proximity**: It may be beneficial to gather the key before heading towards the exit since it may be necessary to unlock doors.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving down from the current position (6, 9) to (7, 9) keeps the avatar safe as it avoids immediate hazards. After moving down, I can then reconsider further movements based on new surroundings.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to provide a better view of the next possible moves, keeping aligned with the strategy of careful navigation and avoiding hazards."

Currently, I should attempt a movement action that has not been executed yet.\n2. I will choose to explore moving up, down, left, or right distinctly since no movement has occurred yet; however, my priority is to eventually reach the exit.\n\nIn this case, rotation might occur, but based on the wall blocking below, I can't proceed down.
