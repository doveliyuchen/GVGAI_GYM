The avatar is currently on an open spot at (2, 2), and there's a key at (4, 5) and a door at (7, 11) leading to the exit. However, there are some hazards (gems) between the avatar and the path towards either the key or the door.\n\n### Action Strategy:\n1. **Objective Analysis:** Move towards the key at (4, 5) since it can unlock the door at (7, 11) and doesn't have immediate hazards around it.\n2. **Movement Options:** The avatar can either move upwards, downwards, left, or right. The safest immediate action is to navigate towards the key while avoiding any gems in the vicinity.\n3. Since the avatar is already positioned two rows above the key, the logical first move is to head down since the vertical navigation does not bring the avatar closer directly to the key horizontally (which lies further below).\n\n### Decision:\nTherefore, I will move the avatar down to (3, 2) with the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should set me on a path closer to the key effectively, while still allowing options to maneuver around the gems.

Since the space directly below (7, 10) is blocked, the next movement should attempt to examine elsewhere but keep moving towards the lower points on the map.\n\nMoving **down** to (6, 11) yields empty space and allows further access as potentially leading downwards towards a different path towards the exit.\n\n### Decision Point:\nAs (6, 11) provides a clear access point and since going down accomplishes a move closer vertically to the exit, the best sustained movement is next to move:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action makes logical sense to avoid potential blockages near the exit, ensuring the strategy follows an ultimate goal to navigate down to the exit effectively while keeping spatial awareness of wall placements in mind."
