It\u2019s crucial to avoid these.\n- The door ('#') is located at (7, 11), which may be a barrier toward reaching the exit. \n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven that I want to head towards the exit while avoiding immediate threats, and since my position hasn't changed yet, I should make a move. However, I must ensure that I navigate towards either collecting the key first or towards an area that allows me to progress without engaging in potentially lethal situations.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe optimal action in this case is to move up from (4, 4) to (3, 4) since this will keep me clear from the red gem while moving towards spaces that have potential moves towards the right where the key is located.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up keeps my position safe and opens up new possibilities for the next turns.
