Both options appear relatively clear.\n\nGiven the current understanding and strategic planning, I will move **Right** since both open spaces are available, and this will help in getting closer toward the exit.\n\n```Action: 2```\n\nMoving to the right will keep me on the path towards the exit while assessing further nearby pathways in subsequent moves."

Since the exit is quite far down, moving through the level carefully while avoiding red gems and walls is crucial.\n2. The key located at (1, 1) can be collected if we move in its direction first. Given keys are crucial for progressing through doors, acquiring it would be beneficial.\n3. Directly moving downwards (the typical direction towards the exit) is blocked by walls after a few moves, so maneuvering around obstacles will be essential.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nThe first step I will take is to move **UP** to (3, 2). This allows me to assess my surroundings again and plot a strategic path toward the goal while avoiding immediate threats from gems or getting caught by walls.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nBy moving up, I can potentially shift my navigation to either head towards the left for the key or plan a safe route down to the exit."

Move down to row 7 (from row 6).\n2. Move down to row 8.\n3. Move down to row 9.\n4. Finally, move down to row 10 to reach the exit.\n\nSince the avatar only needs to move down to get toward the exit, the first immediate action I will take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down is the logical first step towards reaching the exit and is aligned with the victory conditions of the game."

My best immediate option is to move down to (7, 11) to potentially navigate around obstacles later.\n\nI'll take the action to move down. \n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nI expect to see if I can proceed further down or find an alternative route towards the exit without being trapped by walls."

The objective is to navigate towards the exit (represented by $ at (10, 11)) and avoid any hazards, specifically the colored gems which could lead to a loss.\n\nGiven the current map, the following important details are observed:\n\n- Vertical movement from (5, 11) to (6, 11) is blocked by a wall (b).\n- The exit is directly down at (10, 11), but there are potential hazards in this path.\n- The avatar can move up or down to explore more or collect items. No immediate doors or keys are in the direct vicinity.\n\nSince we're currently positioned in a way that we cannot proceed down directly due to the wall and we aim for the exit, we need to consider the next horizontal move.\n\nMoving left (ACTION_LEFT) to (5, 10) would be toward a wall, thus this is invalid. Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) to (5, 12) is also blocked by wall. The only feasible move upward (ACTION_UP) backs us toward a safe area.\n\nAction: 4 (ACTION_UP) \n\nThis action is to explore a safe upper row as the direct downward route is blocked, and we can assess further movement options from there."
