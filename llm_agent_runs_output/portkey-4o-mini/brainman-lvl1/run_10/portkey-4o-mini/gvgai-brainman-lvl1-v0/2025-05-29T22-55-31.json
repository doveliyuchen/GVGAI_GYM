The exit is further down, and moving down (towards row 10) directly seems to be blocked by the wall at row 10 before reaching the exit.\n2. A key at (1, 4) could potentially aid in unlocking doors, which can be key for navigating the level.\n3. There are also two items (a gem and the exit) located in organized rows, it's essential to prioritize accessing these while steering clear of dangers.\n\n### Action Decided:\nSince your current position will remain at (4, 4) if you do not take necessary action, I'll choose to **move down (ACTION_DOWN)** towards row (5, 4). This will allow you to explore further while keeping the path to the exit in mind.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down is part of the strategy to reach the exit and potentially collect more items along the way."

The objectives include navigating through the maze, collecting keys, and reaching the exit at (10, 11). \n\nBased on the layout, the closest action to maximize progress would be to collect the key located at (1, 4), which is directly above the avatar on the same column. Since you can currently move up and potentially collect this key, the appropriate action would be to move UP.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action should allow the avatar to move to (4, 4) next to the key, facilitating future collection and enhancing score potential. Expecting this aligns with the strategy of collecting keys as you navigate through the level towards the exit efficiently."
