Since we don\u2019t need to collect anything from these positions and there are no immediate threats, a movement towards either an empty space or to collect the key would be valid.\n\nMoving either left or right does not present an immediate tactical advantage since they are both empty as well.

The key is located directly to the left of the avatar.\n\nTo collect the key, the avatar will need to move left into that space.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nCollecting the key is crucial to progress further towards the exit, so this action aligns perfectly with our strategy of key management. We expect the avatar to now hold the key and be able to use it later to unlock doors or transform into a more powerful form to interact with other objects."

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, I need to determine the position of the avatar and the immediate surrounding environment. The avatar ('a') is currently positioned at (1, 2), with the following immediate details:\n\n- (1, 1) -> 'w' (keym)\n- (1, 3) -> '.' (empty space)\n- (1, 4) -> '.' (empty space)\n- The walls ('b') surround the area.\n\nHere's the layout of the immediate area around the avatar:\n```\nRow 1: \n(1, 1) -> w (keym) \n(1, 2) -> a \n(1, 3) -> . \n(1, 4) -> . \n```\n\n### Strategy:\nThe keym that is available will allow the avatar to \"kill\" doors. However, the objective is to find a way towards the exit (located at (10, 11)). \n\n### Immediate Actions:\n1. **Collect Keym**: The first step is to move to the left and collect the keym at (1, 1). This will be beneficial for opening doors later in the level.\n  \nChoosing to move left seems like the best action right now.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nCollecting the keym will empower the avatar for interactions with doors later, aligning with the strategy of key management."
