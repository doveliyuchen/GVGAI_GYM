Up \u2192 (1, 11) - Open space (But I need to collect the key from (1,1)).\n\nHowever, given that moving solely upward will take me too far and further away from the key, a better approach is to reposition and analyze possible movement left across rows to potentially reach the key.\n\nI will take the ACTION_LEFT now.\n\n```Action: 1```\nMoving left doesn't lead to any change yet, but it will better position me towards the next strategic placement to navigate around to collect necessary keys."

The avatar can move down to (6, 11), which is also an open floor.\n2. From (6, 11), the avatar can then move down again to (7, 11) where the door is located.\n3. However, to open the door, the avatar needs to collect a key ('&') located at (1, 1) first.\n\nConsidering this, a logical first action would be to move down to (6, 11), which keeps the avatar's progress intact towards the eventual goal of reaching the exit.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action should maintain the strategy of moving towards the exit while planning to collect the necessary key later. After this move, the expectation is that the avatar will be at (6, 11) and I can assess further movement options."

Thus it is not strategic.\n- **DOWN (7, 8):** Moving down will take the avatar to an open space that could lead to more interactions in the next turn.\n- **LEFT (6, 7) or RIGHT (6, 9):** Both will lead to empty spaces.\n\nLogical deduction suggests that moving down would allow greater flexibility for upcoming choices, including potentially moving toward the door or items subsequently.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down towards (7, 8), which maintains options for future turns without risking collection of negative score items.
