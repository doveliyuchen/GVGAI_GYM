The exit (`$`) is at (4, 14).\n\n### Immediate Action Analysis\n1. **Positioning of the Avatar:** My avatar is not in an optimal position to directly collect points or progress towards the exit. The closest high-value items are the key and red gem, along with the door nearby.\n2. **Available Movements:**\n   - Moving **UP** (to (6, 7)) will lead to empty space (`.`).\n   - Moving **DOWN** (to (8, 7)) will also lead to empty space (`.`).\n   - Moving **LEFT** (to (7, 6)) will also lead to empty space (`.`).\n   - Moving **RIGHT** (to (7, 8)) will also lead to empty space (`.`).\n\nNone of these immediate moves contribute to scoring or progressing towards the exit directly. The next significant interaction would either involve using a key or collecting the nearest gem.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nGiven that the avatar's current position is optimal for either gem retrieval or approaching the door with a key, I will prioritize moving towards the **key** first since it can be transformed into a **keym**, which is crucial for unlocking the door and achieving further objectives.\n\nTo collect the key located at (2, 8), I'll need to position myself effectively. My first move will be **UP** to gather better strategic positioning towards the key, as it will also keep my options open for a subsequent move.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nMoving up will help me assess future options more effectively, ultimately aligning my actions with the strategy of key management and maximizing score potential."

I should prioritize collecting gems where possible.\n2. It's crucial to manage keys as they are essential to unlocking doors and achieving my objective (reaching the exit).\n3. Planning movements could give me better positions for collecting resources and avoiding dangers.\n\n### Available Movement Options\nAs my avatar is currently on empty tiles, I can attempt a move. Given that I need to interact with the door at (7,10) for advancement, here's a suggestion for the next move:\n\n1. Move **right (ACTION_RIGHT, to row 7, col 8)** to see if it allows access to nearby areas.\n2. This should keep me close to the door (7,10) on the next turn while also providing option to continue exploring.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right seems reasonable in this context, allowing access to potentially necessary points (like the door or nearby gems) while ensuring that my avatar can change positions dynamically from its current spot."

Moving down to (8, 6) stays on open floor without significant changes. \n\n### Recommended Action\nYour avatar's current location has walls above and below, with limited options on the left.

However, it is not currently reachable as it is several rows above the avatar. Therefore, we may aim for collections that are accessible.\n   \n2. **Key Management:** There is a key directly beneath our avatar which we can collect (8, 8). Collecting it will be helpful for opening doors later.\n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** The only significant concern here is avoiding interactions with colored floors that could harm the avatar, particularly the green gems (g), which are located at (1, 8) and (2, 9), that must be bypassed.\n\n4. **Utilizing Movement Actions:** To collect the key below at (8, 8), we will need to move down.\n\n**Conclusion and Action Selection:**\n\nGiven the current position of the avatar and the next goal (collecting the key below), the most meaningful action at this moment is to move downwards to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to successfully collect the key, enhancing key management for the upcoming door interactions while aligning with our strategy of optimal resource collection."

Since you are already at the door position, you need to open it. \n\nThe action to open the door would typically be to use a key.

    "content": "To determine the best action for the avatar (currently at row 7, column 9) based on the state and the game mechanics, we need to consider the immediate surroundings:\n\n- The avatar is located at (7, 9), which has a door ('#') immediately to the right (at (7, 10)). \n- The tiles immediately around the avatar are as follows:\n  - Left (7, 8) - contains '%', a green gem.\n  - Right (7, 10) - contains '#', a door.\n  - Up (6, 9) - contains '@', a blue gem.\n  - Down (8, 9) - contains 'b', a wall.\n\nGiven these interactions, the door at (7, 10) is a significant point to interact with because it potentially allows for further progression through the level if we have keys available. Currently, the avatar is positioned one tile away from that door.\n\nPer the strategy, we should aim to use our keys effectively to open doors and minimize interactions that could cause harm. However, there are no keys visible at the avatar's current position\u2014which makes it crucial to prioritize reaching toward more interactive elements while avoiding detrimental interactions with the green gem.\n\nThe following move can be made:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar right towards the door, facilitating interaction with it in the next turn (assuming we can interact if we have keys). This aligns with the strategy of managing keys and using interactions effectively to progress through the level."
