However, there is a wall directly to the right at (row=3, col=10), restricting right movement.\n- The left (at row=3, col=8) and downwards (at row=4, col=9) are both available (empty spots). \n- If the avatar chooses to move up (to (row=2, col=9)), it would still be on clear floor, but this may not lead to any immediate benefits since no points or items are in that direction.\n- Collecting the green gem at (row=3, col=11) does not benefit the avatar (and could lead to losing points or an avatar death if interacted with).\n\n### Strategy:\nTo make meaningful progress, the best option to navigate towards the exit while avoiding hazards is to consider moving **down (to row=4, col=9)**, which is an empty space that allows further exploration towards either the exit or towards further gems or keys.\n\n### Expected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is that moving down opens up further movement options while avoiding any immediate hazards that might cause loss of points or death, aligning well with the overall strategy to collect gems and navigate towards the exit."

RIGHT (3, 2) - Move into an empty space (valid).\n3. UP (2, 1) - Move into an empty space (valid).\n4.

However, this requires moving either left or up because both right and down lead to floors but further from the red gem. \n\nAfter considering the layout and proximity of the red gem, moving **up** to (1, 9) allows for a direct interaction with the red gem in the following move (next turn).
