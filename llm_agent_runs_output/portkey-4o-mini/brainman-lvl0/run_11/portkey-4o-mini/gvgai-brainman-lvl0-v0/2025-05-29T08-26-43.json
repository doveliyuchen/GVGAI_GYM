The avatar (represented by 'a') is located at position (row=6, col=8).\n\nNow let's break down the immediate surroundings of the avatar:\n\n- The adjacent tiles around the avatar are:\n  - Up (row=5, col=8): '.' (empty floor)\n  - Down (row=7, col=8): '.' (empty floor)\n  - Left (row=6, col=7): '.' (empty floor)\n  - Right (row=6, col=9): '.' (empty floor)\n\nThis means the avatar can move in any direction (up, down, left, or right) as they are all empty spaces. \n\nSince there are goals, such as avoiding harmful gems and maximizing score, as well as a goal to reach the exit (located at position (row=4, col=14)), I need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Health and Survival:** The avatar cannot touch green or red gems, which adversely affect the avatar's score or survivability. There are green and red gems located at nearby positions (e.g., row=1, col=8 and row=1, col=9) that will negatively impact the avatar if approached.\n  \n2. **Keys and Doors:** The avatar needs to collect keys for opening doors, but there is a key present at (row=2, col=5) and a door at (row=7, col=10).\n\n3. **Scoring Opportunity:** There are blue gems (scoring opportunity) located at (row=2, col=11), (row=7, col=1), and (row=7, col=15). \n\n**Analysis of Possible Actions:**\n- Moving up (to row=5, col=8) will keep the avatar in safe position, as there are no threats.\n- Moving down (to row=7, col=8) also provides a safe empty space; however, further down there are gems that could be harmful.\n- Moving left (to row=6, col=7) is still in a safe position, but it does not bring me closer to key collections.\n- Moving right (to row=6, col=9) is still on a safe floor.\n\nGiven this, I should consider moving to the up position (row=5, col=8) to explore and plan a path towards the exit efficiently while remaining unharmed. This also opens up further potential movements towards the key location.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up allows me to explore further while keeping the avatar safe and avoiding potentially harmful gems. I expect that the next state will provide better visibility of nearby keys or open paths toward the exit."

The exit is located at (4, 14), which is in the fourth row, significantly obstructed by walls, but reachable from the left.\n2. The avatar is currently in a safe position (no immediate threats nearby), but needs to be cautious moving around to avoid harmful sprites (like the green gem (%)).\n3. Moving left or right primarily opens up further exploration, but the path will need to be strategized for key collection and avoiding the negative impacts of the gems.\n\nGiven the current scenario of potential movements and taking into account the strategy to avoid hazards while reaching towards the exit, a meaningful action would be:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis moves the avatar down to (4, 7), providing a chance to explore without immediate hazard. The expectation is to see more clear paths towards the exit or to strategize further with door interactions."

The clear path from our current position to the exit is straightforward but needs careful handling of gems encountered.\n\n### Actions Available:\n- The avatar can move in four possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n### Current Path Analysis:\nFrom position (4, 9):\n- **Left (4, 8):** Contains an empty space (.). Accessible.\n- **Right (4, 10):** Contains a wall (b). Not accessible.\n- **Up (3, 9):** Contains an empty space (.). Accessible.\n- **Down (5, 9):** Contains an empty space (.). Accessible.\n\n### Next Actions:\nThe goal is to reach the exit (4, 14), so moving to the right would ideally be the quickest route. However, since that direction is blocked by a wall, the next best move involves going left to (4, 8), which is clear.\n\nAfter considering the layout and strategizing against the hazards, I will proceed with the following action.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action moves the avatar left to position (4, 8), allowing for further exploration while avoiding any immediate threats.

You have a viable path going downwards to approach the exit but need to determine whether to collect the key or proceed towards the exit directly.\n\nThe strategy suggests a cautious exploration leading towards collecting point treasures or keys while also considering avoiding gem hazards.\n\nThus, the next action will be to move **DOWN** to (4, 6) to potentially explore further towards the exit and see what's in that row. \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is expected to keep progressing towards the exit while also evaluating further options."
