To do so, we need to collect the key we've found (located at (1, 1)).\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe door is directly above the avatar, so we need to take the action that directly accesses the door. However, the avatar will need to navigate carefully if there are obstacles (gems in the vicinity). There are two immediate actions to evaluate:\n\n1. **Go Left (to avoid the green gem)** - which doesn't help in accessing the door. \n2. **Go Right** - to reach the door directly.\n3. **To collect points** - we can also choose to go down to collect blue gems later, but the priority should be on progressing towards the exit.\n\nAs our current objective is to unlock the door directly since it is at (7, 10), moving up is necessary. Let\u2019s initiate this strategic move now, keeping in mind the overall strategy of maximizing the score without losing lives.\n\n### Proposed Action\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to move the avatar up towards the door.

Let's assess the possibilities.\n\n1. The exit (4, 14) is just 5 spaces to the right from my current position (4, 9).\n2. There is a door (7, 10) which would require the key to pass but is not in the way of directly reaching the exit from my current location.\n3. Immediate collection of keys or avoiding gems may be less critical, as the exit is closer and can be reached by moving right.\n\n### Current Situation\n- The immediate action involves trying to reach the exit while avoiding any potential death from the green gems.\n  \n### Chosen Action\nI will proceed to move **to the right (ACTION_RIGHT)** from my current position. This direct approach aims to reach the exit efficiently.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action seems optimal as I head directly towards the exit, allowing me to potentially secure a win if I can move again subsequently without facing death from gems. My expectation is to either reach the exit or position myself favorably for the next move."

There are several interactive elements in the vicinity, including gems and keys, but there is also a green gem near the avatar at position (2, 12) in row 2 and a red gem at (6, 15) below. \n\n### Immediate Observation:\nThe immediate goal is to avoid the green gem since interacting with it will lead to a loss. The key is at (1, 1), which can be accessed in the next move. The avatar is currently in a safe position away from threats, as the nearest gem of concern is quite spaced away. \n\nGiven the mechanics and objectives, the next action should ideally involve moving to collect the key and further explore safe areas without pursuing immediate collection of potentially hazardous gems.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nTo ensure progress while also keeping safe, I will move **UP** from the avatar's current position to (1, 1), which is where the key is located.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nMoving up should be safe as it positions the avatar to collect the key while remaining clear of danger from gems below. After this move, I expect to have more options moving forward while managing the pivotal interactions to navigate effectively toward the exit."

However, since there are some gems nearby, caution is required.\n\nGiven that the objective requires reaching the exit while maximizing score and minimizing risk, moving **down** (to (5, 4)) now is a safe bet because there's nothing hazardous and it opens up more navigation options.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down should help evaluate the next steps without putting the avatar at risk of interacting with any gems immediately."

Neither will cause harm, allowing for exploration of the grid without the risk of encountering death from gems or walls.\n\n3. **Path to the Exit**: The exit ('$') is located at (Row 4, Col 14). Reaching this will also involve past movements through empty spaces and judicious avoidance of hazards.\n\nConsidering these factors and the fact that the avatar's position hasn't changed since the last state, a meaningful action would be to move right to (Row 2, Col 4). This will continue the navigation towards collecting resources and working towards the exit.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right is a safe choice that keeps the avatar clear of immediate threats and maintains progress toward exploring the area."

Around your avatar, you can observe the following:\n\n- **(1, 3) to (1, 9)**: Points of passage that are empty spaces (`.`), allowing movement.\n- **(2, 2) to (2, 10)**: Contains a blue gem (`@`) at (2, 11), a green gem (`%`) at (2, 12), and an open pathway leading downwards.\n- **(6, 0) to (6, 16)**: Includes some green gems, blue gems, and a door (`#`) at (7, 10).\n\nBased on the overall strategy and the immediate layout:\n\n1. **Immediate Goal**: Move toward collecting keys or reaching the exit while avoiding the green gem and managing blue and red gem interactions.\n2. **Available Spaces**: Moving horizontally or downwards is viable since there are multiple open spaces.\n\nTo optimize your movement:\n\n- **Action 1 (LEFT)** moves you to (1, 1), which does not lead to immediate hazards but does not progress vertically where opportunities might await.\n- **Action 2 (RIGHT)** moves you to (1, 3), encountering an empty space, allowing for future movement towards treasures without threats.\n- **Action 3 (DOWN)** leads to (2, 2), where the blue gem is nearby.\n- **Action 4 (UP)** will revert to the wall region above, effectively ineffective.\n\nChoosing **ACTION_RIGHT (2)** appears to be the best course of action, allowing you to continue navigating the open section with opportunities ahead.\n\nSo, the action to take is:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to lead to further pathways towards collecting blue or red gems while keeping clear of immediate hazards."

    "content": "To determine the best action to take, let's first analyze the map and the position of the avatar (denoted by 'a'), which is currently located at (1, 3). \n\n### Important Observations:\n1. The immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n   - Up (0, 3): Wall ('b')\n   - Down (2, 3): Empty space ('.')\n   - Left (1, 2): Empty space ('.')\n   - Right (1, 4): Empty space ('.')\n\n2. There are several collectible items in the vicinity:\n   - The red gem ('*') is located at (6, 15).\n   - The blue gem ('@') is located at:\n     - (2, 11)\n     - (6, 1)\n     - (7, 1)\n     - (7, 15)\n\n3. The ultimate goal is to navigate towards the exit located at (4, 14).\n\n### Current Situation:\nSince the previous state indicated that there has been no movement with the avatar (if the action taken led to no shift in position and strictly rotation), we need to decide on a meaningful action that aligns with the strategy, particularly focusing on minimizing risk and maximizing path efficiency toward the exit.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven that the only option that is available for moving is DOWN (as we can unlock more possible paths in future moves if we explore downwards), I will choose the action to move down.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nBy moving down, I expect to encounter more navigable spaces and potentially find additional pathways or collect items that may assist in reaching the exit."
