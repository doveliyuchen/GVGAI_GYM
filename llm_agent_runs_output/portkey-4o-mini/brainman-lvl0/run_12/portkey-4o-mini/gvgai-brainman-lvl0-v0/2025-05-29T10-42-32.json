The avatar is currently on a floor tile (`.`) and can move freely.\n2. Exiting the level (`$`) is located at (4, 14). However, the exit door is blocked by a boulder (`b`) to its immediate left, indicating that the avatar cannot directly reach the exit.\n3. There are gems and potential keys in the 6th row and below near the avatar but no immediate collection is necessary since the exit is highlighted as a primary target.\n\nGiven the layout of the level, my next action will focus on exploring closer tiles to collect potential items and strategize future moves toward the exit. The position immediately above the avatar (3, 8) is clear and allows for upward movement.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move **upwards**:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis move will allow me to explore higher tiles which might yield helpful items or new pathways towards reaching the exit further down the line."

Moving left would also bring the avatar one step closer to accessing area with potential collectibles or away from dangers (like the green gem).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action feels right as it will allow a new exploration path while ensuring the avatar remains safe on empty grounds.

Moving left does not lead to a wall, but does not bring me closer to the exit. On the other hand, the right (to (row=7, col=10)) is a door ('#') which cannot be crossed.\n\nTherefore, let's assess moving left to (row=7, col=8).

The nearest key is at `(row=2, col=1)`, and could be beneficial for future actions.\n\n### Strategy\nSince there's no immediate pressing need to do anything, a good next move is to explore further, specifically towards potentially valuable objects or paths.\n\n### Chosen Action\nLet\u2019s consider moving downward to `(row=6, col=7)` to explore a larger part of the map while we stay safe.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action opens up more exploration opportunities while staying safe from hazards and prepares for future moves towards keys or gems."
