It's crucial to avoid walls and death sprites (notably below at (4,20) and (8,30)).\n\n### Immediate Action Plan:\nGiven the current position, I should first assess if the suitcase can be moved towards the passenger area simply by attempting to pull it in the direction of the available space without hitting walls or death hazard.\n\n#### Action Choice:\nI will first utilize the upward movement (ACTION_UP) to reposition and check if the suitcase or avatar needs adjustment.
