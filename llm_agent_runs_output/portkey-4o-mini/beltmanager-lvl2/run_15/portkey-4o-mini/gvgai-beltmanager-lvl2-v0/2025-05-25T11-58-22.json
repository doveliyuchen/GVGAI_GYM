The lever is located at (row 9, column 17) and may offer a means to change the orientation or availability of pathways.\n\nI will take the following action due to the current constraints:\n``` Action: 0 ```\nThe expectation with Action 0 is to trigger a confirmation of the avatar's available interactions without losing a turn due to moving in the wrong direction into walls.
