To proceed, let's analyze the possible actions in line with the strategy provided.\n\n1. **Explore the Available Suitcases and Passengers**: \n   - Nearby, there are several suitcases around, particularly at (row 8, col 16) and others along the same row that can be moved towards passengers for scoring.\n   - The passenger is located at (row 9, col 21), reachable from your current position by carefully navigating.\n\n2. **Lever Interactions**: \n   - The lever at (row 9, col 17) can be utilized to potentially manipulate the environment to either direct suitcases or clear paths.\n\n3. **Current Aim**: \n   - One immediate strategy is to move one of the suitcases towards the passengers while also considering the safekeeping of other suitcases from hitting walls or death sprites.\n\nTo align with the overall strategy, I will take the action to rotate and then move right to utilize the available suitcase. Thus, the action command will be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis should allow a strategic placement of the suitcase toward the passenger while keeping an eye on the nearby walls and negative sprites."
