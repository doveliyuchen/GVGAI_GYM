The avatar is located at (8, 16). \n\nNotably, at (8, 17) is a **leverUp** denoted by 'b', which can interact with joints. This presents an opportunity to manipulate the environment and potentially create a path towards passengers.\n\nIn the last action, if the avatar did not move (which needs confirmation), we will aim to execute a different meaningful action. Since the current situation at (8, 16) allows for direct interaction with the lever, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right to interact with the lever. I expect this will allow for new strategic opportunities moving forward in the level."

My primary goal is to collect passengers, avoid the death zones ('%'), and navigate through the level strategically.\n\nLooking at my current surroundings, I have nearby passengers to collect at (9, 21) and I can see several interactive objects. Since I am currently blocked from moving in most directions (left, right, up, down) by walls), the best course of action is to rotate to find a potential path that doesn't involve hitting a wall or death zone.\n\nSince the last action chosen did not move my avatar, I will attempt to rotate right to see if I can lead into a more beneficial position. Thus the next action will be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is intended to rotate my avatar to the right, allowing me to potentially find a path that leads to collecting the passengers without causing collisions. I expect to see if I can then plan my next move based on that orientation and the resulting position."
