I will start by taking a step to the left to see if my avatar is in a position to rotate or move safely.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to rotate left, and if the avatar does not change position, I can analyze the state further to decide the next steps according to the strategy."

The main goal is to reach the 'goal' sprite, represented by '#', while avoiding water hazards ('*') and walls ('&').\n\nIn this scenario, there are numerous avatar positions, particularly on row 14, between columns 7 and 9, with the objective located at (14, 15). The path from the avatars to the goal is slightly blocked on the right by a wall and would require some careful movements or interactions.\n\nSince the user's last position wasn't provided, I'll assume the avatar is facing east towards getting to the goal and will aim to move towards the goal sprite while strategizing around obstacles.\n\nGiven that the avatar needs to reach column 15 where the goal is located, the ideal action would be to move right if there are no obstacles. However, due to the presence of walls adjacent to the right side of the avatars, the most effective initial directional action is to check if a rotation can help clear a path.\n\nI'll opt to move in the direction that turns towards the right (east) to orient towards the goal, thus preparing for the upcoming action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is a preliminary rotation towards the right, to face the goal and plan the next move effectively without moving into walls or hazards. I expect this to align with the strategy of carefully navigating towards the goal while avoiding obstacles."

We see several avatars represented by '@' throughout the map, and our goal is to reach the goal sprite represented by '#'.\n\nExamining the map closely, I can identify:\n- There are several avatars located at (3,1), (3,3), (12,5), (14,7), (14,8), and (14,9).\n- The goal sprite is located at (14,15).\n\nGiven the avatar positions, the next move will be determined based on the proximity to the goal. The avatars on row 14 are the closest to the goal. For example, the avatar at (14,7) can potentially reach the goal by moving towards the right.\n\nHowever, we must also verify the immediate surroundings to ensure there are no hazards and that the movement is indeed leading toward the goal.\n\nThe action will be engaging with the avatar located at (14,7) by moving it to the right towards the goal at (14,15).\n\nLet\u2019s execute the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should successfully move the avatar to the right towards the goal, aligning with our strategy to prioritize reaching the goal while keeping track of hazards."
