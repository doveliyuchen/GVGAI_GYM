The location of the avatar ('@') is at (row=14, col=7) which is on the same row where there are walls and other elements. \n2. The goal sprite ('#') is located at (row=14, col=15), which indicates the direction we need to navigate towards.\n3. There are walls in the immediate vicinity to consider, notably at (row=15, col=0 to 15) and (row=14, col=0 to 6) surrounding the avatar.\n4. There are multiple interaction points with 'water' (represented by '*'), which should be avoided as they lead to losing the game.\n\n### Movement Consideration:\nGiven that the avatar is facing an unobstructed path to the right (east), the first logical movement would be to move directly towards the goal. However, we must ensure that there are no obstacles in the avatar's motion path.\n\n### Actions to Take:\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Navigate one space to the right into (row=14, col=8) which is a clear floor (not a wall or water).\n  \nThis movement takes the avatar closer to the goal while adhering to the game strategy of prioritizing movement towards goal sprites.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar closer to the goal and aims to reduce the overall goal sprite count on the map. I expect to see the avatar's position updated to (row=14, col=8) after this action."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state, let\u2019s first summarize the key aspects of the map and the potential next actions for my avatar:\n\n### Observations:\n- The avatar's current position is likely positioned near the middle of the grid, given the general layout.\n- There are multiple wall tiles ('&'), water tiles ('*'), and goal tiles ('#') throughout the layout.\n- The goal tile at (14, 15) is represented by '#', indicating the target to achieve.\n- There are various paths around walls, but water tiles pose significant obstacles since moving into water results in avatar death.\n- Other elements such as 'moving floor' ($), and 'goal floor' (#) provide additional strategic options.\n\n### Current Position:\nThe action options will be determined based on avoiding hazards (like water and walls) while moving towards a goal. Assuming the immediate next moves don\u2019t provide any critical movement, I need to analyze potential horizontal or vertical movements based on the outlined map.\n\n### Strategy Application:\n1. **Avoid Water:** Identify paths that don\u2019t lead directly into tiles marked with '*'.\n2. **Path to Goal:** Since the end goal is at (14, 15), strategising a movement pattern that brings the avatar close to that area is essential.\n3. **Utilize Clear Spaces:** Paths shown with '.' and the moving elements will be prioritized.\n4. **Rotate & Move:** Since I might need to change orientation before moving, I\u2019ll keep in mind that directional actions could involve a rotation first.\n\n### Deciding Action:\nGiven there are several walls around, I need to ensure my avatar moves towards the right direction while avoiding collision with walls. I will initiate a movement that effectively progresses towards clearer paths or goal paths.\n\nNow, I will take the action to move down, as it appears there are paths at (14, 1) and similar rows that might lead towards the goal:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expecting to progress downward into a potential path leading through clearer tiles or nearer to my goal while avoiding wall and water hazards."

Observing the provided map representation, it is crucial to analyze surrounding elements to formulate the most strategic action.\n\nThe avatar positioned in row 14 (col 7, 14, and 8) has movement options available towards the right (towards col 8) or potentially upwards (row 13, col 7) depending on the avatar's trajectory. However, the immediate adjacent cells include walls on the left and downward, and only moving east to col 8 appears open.\n\nTaking into account the mechanics and goals of the game, my immediate next action should be to move east to potentially access a possible path open to further exploration and goal sprites. \n\nThus, the best action to proceed is:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is aimed at moving eastward, with the expectation to open new pathways and avoid any obstacles."
