The safest immediate action is to move east toward (row 14, col 8) which is an eastfacing floor.\n2. This allows the avatar to maintain its current direction towards the goal while avoiding moving into the hazardous water area. \n\n### Action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nI expect this action to align with our strategy by keeping the avatar's direction toward the goal while safely using a floor space without immediate hazards."

The avatar moving may interact with the elemental map, but as it is not clear, I will assume the last action taken didn't move (so actions are to be reconsidered). \n\nSince the goal is to reach sprite `#` at position (14, 15), there are some obstacles:\n- There are several water hazards below this goal area that could impede movement.\n  \nTo get closer to the goal, I recommend moving in the direction that will head toward the right since the column with the goal sprite will likely require eliciting movement to navigate around the water hazards.\n\nI will take an action to move the avatar right, given that it can clear the path towards the goal while analyzing obstacles.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nI expect this action to shift the avatar toward the right side effectively, which brings it closer to the path leading to the goal represented by `#`."

Moving in that direction seems to be the most direct path to eliminate the goal, as there are no barriers in that immediate path.\n\nThus, I will perform the action that moves my avatar right.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should successfully move the avatar towards the goal, which aligns with our strategy to prioritize eliminating goal sprites while managing movement effectively."
