Determine the last known position of the avatar more explicitly if possible in the map's layout.\n2. Plan a safe path toward the goal (14, 15) while avoiding water hazards.\n3. Considering the mechanics of sprite interactions allows just enough setup to reach the target.\n\nIf the avatar can see the goal directly and there's a path, I could either move `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, or `DOWN`. Since there\u2019s no indication of the current avatar position specifically, we will simulate that the action now should ideally help navigate toward (14, 15), focusing on moving towards the area with `@`.\n\nGiven that path planning seems to navigate toward the goal while avoiding walls or illegitimate sprites, a directional action will be preferred which assumes no immediate hazards block the way from the avatar\u2019s present position.\n\n### Default Action:\nDue to the structure of the map with information limited to navigation assumptions, I will start with `ACTION_DOWN`, which might take the avatar closer to the area where the goal is visible.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis should help the avatar progress downward toward the goal if positioned near walls, and I expect to see if the avatar's position changes or if it rotates accordingly based on mechanisms. If it remains still, the next movement will shift as I assess the next best route."

If I keep moving right (if not hitting walls or other hazards), I can achieve my objective.\n\nSince my avatar is currently located at (14, 7) and the goal is at (14, 15), I will perform the following action to move right towards the goal:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action is intended to position the avatar closer to the goal while avoiding any unnecessary hazards.

    "content": "To analyze the current state, let's summarize the avatar's surroundings and assess the best action:\n\n- **Avatar Position**: Currently at (14, 7) on a southfacing floor (represented as '@').\n- **Nearby Sprites**:\n  - To the immediate left (14, 6): a moving floor ('@').\n  - To the immediate right (14, 8): a moving floor ('@').\n  - Above (13, 7): empty area ('.').\n  - Below (15, 7): wall ('&').\n  \n### Strategy Consideration:\nGiven the avatar's position on a southfacing floor, moving towards the left (to (14, 6)) or right (to (14, 8)) would keep it on a moving floor, which might allow for progression based on the game mechanics. Moving upward to (13, 7) is also a viable option as it leads to an open space. \n\nSince the last action is not specified, and we are primarily focused on moving toward the goal:\n\n1. **Evaluate**: \n   - Left: (14, 6) is safe.\n   - Right: (14, 8) is safe as well.\n   - Up: (13, 7) is also safe but does not directly approach the goal.\n\n### Planned Action:\nMoving right to (14, 8) seems most beneficial as it is still on the moving floor and potentially keeps options open for further movement towards the goal (15, 15).\n\n### Action Execution:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar right into another moving floor, keeping strategic options open while progressing. I expect this aligns with our strategy to safely navigate and advance toward the goal."
