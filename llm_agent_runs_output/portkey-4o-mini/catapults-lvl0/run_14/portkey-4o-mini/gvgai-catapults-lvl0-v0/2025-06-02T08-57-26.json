    "content": "Given the current state of the game, it appears that the objective is to navigate towards the goal sprite, represented by `#`, located at (14, 15). The avatar (`a`) is currently at (12, 5) facing south (`%`), while various obstacles and beneficial elements are spread throughout the environment.\n\n### Given the following conditions:\n- The avatar can interact with walls (`&`), water (`*`), and various types of floors.\n- Interactions around the current position indicate the importance of avoiding water and walls to ensure survival.\n\n### Current Analysis\nFrom the avatar's position (12, 5), the immediate area is as follows:\n- (11, 5): `*` (water) - **Avoid**\n- (13, 5): `*` (water) - **Avoid**\n- (12, 6): `*` (water) - **Avoid**\n- (12, 4): `@` (eastfacing) - **Can potentially rotate towards goal direction (right)**\n\n### Action Taken\nMoving horizontally and considering the surroundings, the logical action would be to move to the right (east) to position at (12, 6). However, since that is water, we'll proceed by taking an alternate path:\n\n1. **Rotate first to face East and then move:** \n   - Since the objective is to make progress towards the goal while ensuring avatar safety, I need to rotate first and then take an action.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the avatar's position will not change initially (it will simply rotate without moving), I will **rotate east** and attempt to follow through with my intended movement:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis means I attempt to move right (east) towards (12, 6) after the rotation. \n\n### Feedback\nI expect this action will successfully orient the avatar towards available non-detrimental sprite space to eventually navigate closer to the goal while avoiding water and ensuring survival."

The goal is located at (14,14) and represented by '#'. The layout of the game shows that there are potential paths toward the goal, with walls that may block straightforward movement.\n\nThe avatar's current position is crucial. Since no specific initial position for the avatar is provided in the current state description, I will assume that it's initially placed at a reasonable starting point, such as the bottom row before reaching the goal. However, the avatar must maneuver through the various sprites, particularly avoiding water and managing interactions with walls and catapults.\n\nGiven the last action was analyzed to not result in movement, if I assume a recent position where the avatar is facing east and the goal is directly reachable in two horizontal movements while staying clear of dangers, I will suggest the action to move eastwards.\n\nAccording to the analysis and the strategies outlined, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of moving directly towards the goal while looking to avoid any interactions with water or walls. Following this action, I would expect the avatar to shift positions effectively and make progress toward the goal."
