The goal is to reach the exit represented by a `#`.\n\nFrom the visual map, I can see that the position of the avatar matters significantly. The avatar is currently at position (14, 7). The immediate surrounding area includes `@`, which may suggest interactions that could be harmful or beneficial.\n\nSince water (`*`) is located nearby, as well as catapults (`@`), it is imperative to navigate away from hazardous areas to avoid instant losses. \n\nTo initiate movement and explore options, I\u2019ll take action to navigate left toward (14, 6), which may allow me to assess potential movement options without falling into water or hitting obstacles. This position also keeps the avatar away from immediate threats as defined in the strategy.\n\nThus, the chosen action will be:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis left movement should not only help in repositioning the avatar but also allow for strategic planning regarding the next steps."

It is crucial to avoid water to prevent losing the avatar. Thus, we should navigate carefully around water areas.\n2. We should also prioritize successfully reaching the goal while managing interactions with other sprites.\n\nBased on the analysis of the current sprite distribution and avoiding potential hazards, if the avatar is currently facing east (to the right), moving right could allow it to progress towards the goal. \n\nIf the avatar's previous action resulted in no change in position (which is not explicitly detailed here), I will assume that a directional action needs to be implemented again to attempt to make progress.\n\nMoving right towards the goal while ensuring we don\u2019t encounter water or walls directly adjacent is the best course of action.\n\nThus, I will take the following action: \n``` \nAction: 2 \n``` \nThis rightward movement expects to successfully advance towards the goal without the avatar's position freezing due to rotation mechanics."
