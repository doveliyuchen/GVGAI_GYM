(navigable floor)\n  \nConsidering the overall strategy, I want to avoid walls and maximize my avatar's ability to navigate towards the goal (`#`), which is present at `(row 14, col 15)`. The game encourages me to move strategically and avoid hazards like the catapult.\n\n### Next Possible Action Decision:\nI'll first try to rotate in place (if necessary) before trying to move right towards the goal. The goal is just two spaces to the right of me. \n\nFirst, I attempt to move right to (row 14, col 8), where another westfacing floor is present.\n\nExpected action outcome:\n1. If I can move directly to (row 14, col 8), I can reassess from there.\n2. If I don't move, I rotate, and I will need to take another action to actually move next.\n\nBased on the analysis, I will execute the following action:\n\n```Action:2``` \n\nThis move aims to progress towards my goal, hoping to maintain alignment with the outlined strategy by moving closer to the destination while avoiding complex interactions."

There are two more avatars at (row 14, col 8) and (row 14, col 9). \n- The goal is located at (row 14, col 15) represented by the sprite '#'.\n- The path between the avatars and the goal contains obstacles (walls '&') and free spaces (floor '_') that can be traversed.\n- There is a wall at (row 15, col x) indicating a complete blockade on the row below, which separates the avatar area from the bottom row.\n\n### Available Actions:\nGiven the current position of the avatars and the location of the goal, the best strategy is to navigate towards the right to clear a path towards the goal.\n\n1. **Action Right (ACTION_RIGHT = 2)**: By moving right from (14, 7), it would lead to (14, 8) where another avatar exists. Since there are multiple avatars together, this does not obstruct the progress towards the goal, which is at (14, 15).\n  \n2. **Following the Sequence**: Moving to (14, 8) would then allow me to continue moving to (14, 9) and subsequently to (14, 10) and so on, until I reach the goal.\n\nI choose the action: \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right seems the most logical step to take, moving towards the goal and keeping the avatars aligned for further actions. My expectation is to advance towards the goal while maintaining the avatars for future moves."
