The objective is to navigate to the goal while avoiding collisions with enemies and utilizing the environment strategically.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s review the location of key sprites:\n- Our avatar ('a') is at (6, 8).\n- There is a goal ('%') at (8, 12).\n- Enemies ('$') are located at (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 13), (8, 3), and (9, 3).\n\nGiven the layout, the avatar needs to move down or right to get closer to the goal without hitting the enemies. The enemies at (8, 3) and (9, 3) are directly below our avatar, while the goal is situated further down on the right side at (8, 12).\n\n### Observations:\n1.

(empty space)\n   - Directly right (5, 13): '@' (boulder)\n\n2. **Moving Down**: If we move down to (6, 12), the avatar will encounter a boulder. It won't be able to proceed further down or push it aside since the next move positions need to be free.\n3. **Moving Up**: This direction is blocked by a wall and not an option.\n4. **Moving Left**: Moving left to (5, 11) is an empty space which allows for potential future moves.\n5. **Moving Right**: Moving right to (5, 13) will result in meeting another boulder, which also limits movement.\n\n### Strategy Decision:\nBased on the layout, the best immediate action is to **move left to (5, 11)**, as this will open up the avatar's position for future movements away from the boulders, and it allows for another round of actions without encountering an enemy directly.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThe decision to move left opens up more options in the next turn while keeping the avatar safe from immediate threats.

Your avatar also needs to navigate around enemies ('$'), boulders ('@'), crates ('#'), holes ('&' and '*'), and walls ('b').\n\n### Analyzing the Game State:\n- The path from your current position to the goal involves passing through a variety of obstacles.\n- Directly below you, at (6, 10), there is a boulder, which might block further downward movement.\n- The enemies present are at (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 10), (8, 8), and (9, 3). The ones particularly in the way could be challenging for direct routes, but the environmental mechanics can also be used to defeat them without direct confrontation.\n\n### Strategy Execution:\n1. **Path Exploration**: The shortest vertical direction is to move down towards row 7 and then attempt to maneuver towards your right since the goal is further down and to the right.\n2. **Avoiding Enemies and Collisions**: If you go down, you'll hit the boulder. Instead, a rotation action may be required.\n3. **Plan Subsequent Moves**: Rotating first to explore new paths might be more beneficial rather than making direct moves that could lead to collisions.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nTo align with the operational strategy while ensuring movement to the right:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action intends to position the avatar right, potentially allowing for further moves towards the goal and away from the enemies below. I expect this will set up for clear horizontal movement ahead to approach the goal while navigating around obstacles."

If I attempt to move right, there will be a rotation but not an actual move, so I would still be at (row=6, col=10). I would need to move again to effect a change.\n\nThe next strategic action is to check the surrounding enemy positions. The closest enemy below is (row=9, col=6). Moving left seems less fruitful since it does not improve positioning towards the goal.\n\nThus, the most reasonable action is to move down, where there are likely fewer immediate threats.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow the avatar to move down to (row=7, col=10) where there are no enemies directly below and explore the path towards the goal more safely."

This would allow further movement options next turn without direct collision risk.\n\n### Action Execution:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI anticipate that moving up will keep me safe from enemies and allow me to reposition for the next turn towards the goal.

The important surrounding entities are:\n\n- `(4, 8) -> .` (an empty space)\n- `(6, 8) -> .` (an empty space)\n- `(5, 7) -> .` (an empty space)\n- `(5, 9) -> .` (an empty space)\n- `(4, 7) -> .` (an empty space)\n- `(6, 7) -> .` (an empty space)\n- In the vicinity, there are also boulders `(2, 2)`, `(2, 11)`, and enemies at `(1, 1)`, `(2, 13)`, and `(8, 6)` which we need to avoid or plan around.\n\nThe primary objective is to get to the goal at `(8, 12)`, and since there are several empty spaces around the avatar, I need to analyze which direction is safe and also brings me closer to my goal.\n\nSince the avatar is currently blocked by walls on the left, and the closest path to the goal appears to be moving down from row 5 to row 8 while avoiding direct interaction with enemies, the best action here would be to move **down** to `(6, 8)`.\n\nExecuting this action, I expect the avatar to move down without colliding with any enemies, keeping in line with the overall strategy of avoiding direct conflict.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to be safe and help piecing together a path toward the goal."

    "content": "Given the current state, the avatar ('a') is located at (6, 8). The goal ('%') is situated at (8, 12). There are several enemies ('$') positioned at (1, 1), (2, 1), (8, 6), and (8, 10). Additionally, there are boulders ('@') and crates ('#') which can be potentially used to navigate or eliminate enemies.\n\n### Current Position Analysis:\n- The avatar's position (6, 8) allows potential movement in the following ways:\n  - Up (5, 8) - clear path\n  - Down (7, 8) - clear path\n  - Left (6, 7) - clear path\n  - Right (6, 9) - clear path\n\n### Enemy Threats:\n- Direct confrontation with enemies should be avoided to prevent losing health points. Enemies surround the area but can potentially be avoided or led into other hazards (like holes).\n\n### Next Possible Moves:\n1. Moving down from (6, 8) to (7, 8) keeps the avatar away from immediate threats and continues downward towards the goal.\n2. The surrounding areas below the current position are mostly clear and do not pose direct threats aside from the identified enemies.\n\nGiven this information, the most strategic action right now is to move **down** to (7, 8), which ultimately positions the avatar towards the goal (8, 12) and maintains a safe distance from direct enemy contact.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action keeps the avatar advancing forward towards the goal while avoiding enemy engagement. I expect to see progress towards the goal in the next move."
