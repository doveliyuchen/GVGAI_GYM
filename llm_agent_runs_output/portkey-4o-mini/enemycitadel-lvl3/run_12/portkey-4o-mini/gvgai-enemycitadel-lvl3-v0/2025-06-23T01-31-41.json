We need to navigate carefully to avoid losing health, especially since the enemy is in the vicinity directly below the avatar.\n  \n2. **Goal Path**: The path to the goal (8, 12) requires moving down to row 8 while avoiding the enemy at (8, 8).

However, moving the boulders or crates is necessary to block the enemy or create alternative routes.\n\n### Strategy Decision\nThe current positioning of the avatar makes navigation tricky. Moving down (which would be `ACTION_DOWN` or 3) could lead to an immediate collision with the enemy. Instead, it may be more prudent to position the avatar first. Since the avatar can't step through the wall and needs to avoid health loss, I'll first rotate the avatar to check possible moves.\n\n### Chosen Action\nSince the avatar will initially rotate to check the layout and continue analyzing the best move, I will execute a `nil` action first but expect to re-evaluate immediately afterward to proceed strategically.\n\n``` Action:0 ```\nThis action is a placeholder.
