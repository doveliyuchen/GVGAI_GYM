Moving **Left** to (row=6, col=3) - It leads to an empty space but does not bring us closer to the goal.\n2. Moving **Right** to (row=6, col=5) - It leads to an empty space as well and does not immediately get us closer to the goal.\n3. Moving **Down** to (row=7, col=4) - It leads to a round hole (`&`).

However, before taking further action towards the hole, it's crucial to ensure a safe position while assessing any potential threats.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best immediate action is to move **UP** to (3, 6), where there is the round hole (&).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action aims to maneuver the avatar to the hole to potentially interact with it and consider next steps strategically while monitoring the position of enemies as well."

To devise a strategy, I need to analyze the surroundings:\n\n- **Location Overview**:\n  - Below the avatar (row 6) has several moving objects (3 boulders) at columns (11, 12, 13) but no immediate enemies.\n  - On row (8), a goal is located at (8, 12) along with several enemies scattered around.\n\n- **Immediate Risk**:\n  - There are enemies directly below the avatar at (8, 3) and (9, 3). There\u2019s also a square hole below at (8, 11).\n\nGiven the current map and the objective to eliminate enemies and secure the goal, the next prudent step is to reposition my avatar to either push a crate nearby, set up a movement to eliminate an enemy, or move toward the goal.\n\n### Possible Actions Analysis:\n1. **Moving Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: This will bring the avatar to (5, 1), but it doesn't assist in the current strategy as there are no immediate crates or holes.\n2. **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: (5, 3) - This is an empty space which allows maneuvering but loses positioning to deal with the immediate threats.\n3. **Moving Down (ACTION_DOWN)**: (6, 2) - This gives the most options; it allows my interaction with dreadfully surrounded and accessible boulders located in row 6 as well as keeps the enemies in sight for a future action.\n4. **Moving Up (ACTION_UP)**: (4, 2) - There\u2019s no immediate enemy or objective benefit moving this way.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the situation, the most strategic move is ACTION_DOWN (6, 2), as it allows the avatar to be in a better position to deal with the enemies and interact with available objects (boulders). \n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nMoving down is expected to maximize my effective response to the environment and prepare for upcoming interactions on the next turn."

Given the player's current position and the surrounding hazards, it's important to plan a move that either effectively handles an enemy or sets up a future advantageous position.\n\n### Current Movement Decisions\nLet's describe the possible moves from the avatar's current position:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (to 5, 5)**: This move is to an empty space (`.`), might allow maneuvering to avoid enemies.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (to 5, 7)**: Another empty space (`.`), again moving away from any enemy but not progressing towards the goal.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (to 6, 6)**: Another empty space (`.`), slightly leading down the level.\n4. **ACTION_UP (to 4, 6)**: Empty space above, but this doesn't facilitate approaching enemies or goals directly.\n\nConsidering the immediate threats (enemies at (1, 1), (8, 3), (8, 8), (8, 12)) and also potential utilization of crates/boulders, the action with the most potential nearby would be to move down (to (6, 6)) where there are more boulders to manipulate.\n\n### Selected Action\nI will execute the **ACTION_DOWN** movement.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move positions me in an area with more manipulatable objects, ideally allowing future actions for dealing with the enemies or reaching the goal effectively."
