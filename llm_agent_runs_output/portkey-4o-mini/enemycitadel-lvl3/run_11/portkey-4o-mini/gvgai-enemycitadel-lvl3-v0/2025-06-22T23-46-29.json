This could potentially allow for pushing the boulder in future turns, opening opportunities to engage or remove threats, and it keeps me on track towards navigating toward the goal.\n\nI will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move aims to interact with the boulder while advancing towards my goal, aligning well with my overall strategy of utilizing objects dynamically.

Surrounding the avatar are multiple instances of boulders and crates, as well as some enemies that could potentially pose a threat.\n\n### Objectives and Strategy:\n1. The avatar's primary objective is to navigate towards the goal, which is located at (row=8, col=12). \n2. Avoid direct contact with the enemies located near (row=2, 3 and row=8, 6) since colliding with them would reduce health points.\n3. Utilize the surrounding boulders and crates effectively to clear out threats and create a safe path toward the goal.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nCurrently, the avatar has not moved from its last position and is situated next to a boulder. To proceed safely and effectively towards the goal, I have the following movement options:\n\n- Moving **UP** to (row=5, col=9) leads to an empty space but keeps the avatar away from the enemies.\n- Moving **DOWN** towards the goal (row=7, col=9) is blocked by walls and could potentially lead them closer to threats.\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** does not bring any beneficial change due to surrounding boulders and walls.\n\nSince the options to push interactable objects toward enemies are limited due to walls, an **UP** movement appears to be the safest option to evaluate the current situation without losing health.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up will allow observation of the surroundings and further potential actions while ensuring health safety."

To continue, I must focus on:\n1. Manipulating the crates and boulders to clear a path to the goal.\n2. Avoid confronting enemies directly unless necessary.\n3. Gradually make my way south towards the goal while ensuring I maintain my health.\n\nSince the previous direction attempted did not result in movement, and I have to analyze for a new direction where I can either move or interact beneficially.\n\n### Selected Actions:\n- There isn't a wall to the left (6, 6), I can move left to (6, 6) then re-assess my options from there.\n\nThus, the action will be:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis left movement may help me reposition nearer an interactable object and re-evaluate my next best move in line with our overall strategy to avoid enemy collisions."
