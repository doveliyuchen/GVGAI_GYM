Moving up may not lead me closer to enemies or obstacles to clear, whereas moving right leads me toward further exploration of empty spaces.\n\nBased on this analysis, I choose to move **Right**.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action keeps me moving toward potential paths while avoiding any immediate danger from enemies, helping to navigate strategically toward the goal.

Immediate action should prioritize evading the enemy at (8, 3).\n2. **Positioning**: The avatar is currently positioned on (6, 9), facing towards (7, 9) which is a wall (b).\n3. **Movement Strategy**: Since (7, 9) is a wall, moving down would not change the position. The viable movements for the avatar, considering the need to avoid the enemy, would be left (to (6, 8)) or up (to (5, 9)) into empty spaces.\n\nThe potential actions based on current positional constraints are:\n- **ACTION_LEFT (2, 8)**: Moves to an empty space (6, 8).\n- **ACTION_UP (5, 9)**: Moves to an empty space (5, 9).\n\n### Evaluation of Actions:\n- **Left to (6, 8)**: This position is open and does not bring the avatar into proximity with enemies, but still keeps options open for further movements.\n- **Up to (5, 9)**: This is also an open space, but does not provide new tactical advantages since both (6, 8) and (5, 9) lead to further open spaces, but referencing the closer path to the goal appears to leverage downward navigation once above obstacles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the left move positions the avatar closer towards navigating the potential downward path while still avoiding enemies, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left to (6, 8) looks solid as it keeps options open to navigate around without directly facing enemies."

The goal ('%') is located at (8, 12); however, reaching it might require managing the boulders strategically.\n\n2. **Health Management:** No immediate risks for health since there are no enemies nearby.\n\n3. **Utilize Crates and Boulders:** There are two ways to manage the boulders in relation to enemies, but I need to focus on movement. Since the avatar cannot move down or sideways this turn due to walls, the only option will be to interact with the boulders to move towards an objective.\n\n4. **Puzzles and Navigation:** The avatar needs to find an opening. Moving left or right from position (6, 10) may lead to examining new paths.\n\n5. **Avoid Deadlocks:** Since I am currently blocked from most directions, I need to assess potential actions that can lead to future moves.\n\nTo execute my best strategy, I will move left to position (6, 9), where there is an empty path (represented by '.'). \n\nThus, I will perform the following action:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nI expect this action to open up further mobility options in the next turn."

Our avatar's immediate surroundings include enemies above at (2, 10) and the potential for maneuvering towards the goal at (8, 12).\n2. Since the avatar is currently at (6, 9), I will check possible moves. I can move left to (6, 8) or right to (6, 10), as moving up (to (5, 9)) encounters a wall, and moving down (to (7, 9)) encounters wall obstacles.\n3. Moving left (to (6, 8)) may not yield immediate benefits since it leads to an empty space but does not immediately seem to benefit navigation to the goal either. Moving right (to (6, 10)) leads to an enemy, which could potentially hurt me.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best immediate action is to **move left to (6, 8)**.

    "content": "To determine the next action, we need to analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map. Your avatar ('a') is situated at coordinate (6, 9) within the 2D grid. Surrounding your avatar are various elements, including walls ('b'), enemies ('$'), boulders ('@'), crates ('#'), and holes ('&', '*'), along with the goal ('%') located at (8, 12).\n\nHere\u2019s a quick visual of the relevant area around your avatar:\n\n```\n. . . . . . . . a . . . @ @ @\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . # # . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . % . .\n```\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (6, 8):** This leads to an empty space (.) with no immediate threat from walls or enemies.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (6, 10):** This also lands on a boulder (@), which could allow interaction.\n3. **ACTION_UP (5, 9):** This remains in an empty space (.) with no walls or threats around.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (7, 9):** This also lands on another empty space, but it allows access to the goal area below soon after.\n5. **ACTION_NIL:** No action is taken.\n\n### Strategy Considerations\nBased on your current position and surrounding state, the goal is to reach (8, 12), and there are minimal barriers or threats immediately around, allowing you opportunities to make safe movements.\n\nTo optimize the path towards the goal:\n- The option to move down to (7, 9) is beneficial, as it opens up more pathing options toward the goal (going further down will get you closer to (8, 12)).\n- Alternatively, moving up (5, 9) is also an option, but it does not directly get you closer to the goal.\n\n### Recommended Action\nI choose to move down because it keeps us progressing toward the goal without engaging enemies or obstacles, positioning us closer to the goal in the next move.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis action is expected to keep us safe while allowing for quicker access to the goal location in subsequent turns."

The surrounding environment features various obstacles and enemies, and to proceed effectively, I need to keep in mind the necessity to navigate while managing my health and aiming to reach the goal.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The immediate right (6, 10) has a boulder '@' which may not be necessary to interact with at this moment.\n- The immediate left (6, 8) is possible to explore further since it is empty.\n- Above (5, 9) and below (7, 9) are both unoccupied spaces where I can move without immediate risk.\n- There's also potential interaction with enemies located at (1, 3), (1, 11), and (8, 3), (8, 8), and (8, 9) below that could lead to lost health points, so I should be careful.\n\n**Action Plan:**\nTo effectively proceed forward in the puzzle while avoiding encounters with enemies, I will choose to move down (to row 7, column 9) as this location is unoccupied and allows me to avoid risk.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows for safe exploration of the area below, which may open up further options and help assess possible strategies for reaching the goal while maintaining health."
