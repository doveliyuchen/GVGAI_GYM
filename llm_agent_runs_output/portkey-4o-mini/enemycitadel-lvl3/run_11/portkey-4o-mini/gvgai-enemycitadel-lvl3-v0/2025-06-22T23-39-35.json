Alternatively, if manipulation of the environment (e.g., pushing a boulder or crate) can eliminate enemies or alter the landscape favorably, that should be prioritized.\n\nNotably, I observed that moving downwards (to (7, 9)) would allow for the potential action of moving towards the nearby enemies or dealing with boulders.

Avoid them to prevent damage.\n- **Goal**: The goal is at (8, 12), which is two rows down from your current position, and you will need to navigate to reach it.\n- **Crates and Boulder**: There are crates and boulders nearby (specifically at (2, 6), (2, 7), (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 13)).\n- No immediate walls obstructing your movement downward to (7, 8), and there are some potential strategic interactions with crates and boulders nearby.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo determine the most effective action:\n1. **Movement**: Since the position is (6, 8) and seems open vertically down without immediate walls, it makes sense to move **downward** to (7, 8).\n2. **Potential Interactions**: This will set you up for potentially moving toward the goal on the next turn while avoiding the enemies for now.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect this action to move the avatar down to (7, 8), positioning it closer to the goal while avoiding contact with enemies, which aligns with the strategy of maintaining health and working towards scoring."

The goal is to reach (8, 12), which is three rows down and two columns to the right from the avatar's current position.\n\n### Current Strategy Alignment:\n- **Avoiding enemies**: The avatar should not move directly down, as it would collide with the enemy at (6, 10).\n- **Navigating through crates and open spaces**: The avatar can move left or right to create a safer route.\n- **Towards the goal**: The optimal path would likely involve navigating down while avoiding the enemy.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nMoving left (to (5, 9)) will clear the current row and create a situation where the avatar can analyze further movements without immediately facing an enemy. This also ensures the avatar can then check the next move options without losing health.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action allows repositioning to assess further moves while keeping a safe distance from the enemy, aligning with the overall strategy to avoid unnecessary risks."

There are boulders (`@`), crates (`#`), and enemies (`$`) located around the avatar. The primary objective is to reach the goal while avoiding damage from enemies and managing our interactions with crates and boulders.\n\n### Immediate Objectives:\n1. The avatar should try to navigate towards the goal while avoiding enemies.\n2. The avatar needs to assess if moving in any direction will help path towards the goal without running into enemies.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n- **Up (to (4, 11))**: would move to an empty space (`.`).\n- **Down (to (6, 11))**: would move to a boulder (`@`).\n- **Left (to (5, 10))**: would move to an empty space (`.`).\n- **Right (to (5, 12))**: would move to an empty space (`.`).\n\nFrom these possible moves, the safest actions are to move **up** or **left**, since both would move the avatar to an empty space and allow potential further movement towards the goal.\n\nConsidering potential threats from enemies:\n- Moving down is not optimal since it runs into a boulder and could potentially complicate navigation.\n- Moving right doesn't lead closer to the goal but keeps the avatar aligned with potential threats.\n\nGiven the overall objective, the best action right now is to move **up** as this opens up potential next moves toward the goal.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should allow movement towards clearer paths and keep the avatar away from immediate threats, aligning with the broader strategy of managing interactions wisely and aiming for the goal."

The quickest route toward reaching the goal at (8, 12) is to move downward.\n\n### Actions:\n1. Check movement downward:\n   - Move Down to (6, 12), which contains a boulder (@). This means the avatar would bounce back after attempting to move down.\n  \n2. Post downward movement failure due to obstacle (boulder):\n   - The avatar can then try moving Left to (5, 11), which is empty and then consider moving down or right again.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that moving downward fails due to the boulder, next we can try moving left first, which is a safer and more strategic choice to try and navigate around the boulder.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis left move will allow for further potential navigation to avoid obstacles and makes progress toward the goal by planfully maneuvering around the boulders."

Avoiding immediate confrontation with enemies and planning potential interactions using crates or boulders to eliminate enemies effectively.\n2.

Avoid enemies and navigate towards the goal.\n2. Analyze immediate moves based on the current layout.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe current position (5, 8) does not have any immediate actions that increase score, as crates and enemy interactions are further away. Looking at the map, the most logical move is to start moving downwards towards the goal.\n\nGiven that the current position of the avatar does not change after the initial action, I will try moving **up** first to see if the avatar can successfully rotate and then move down next.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis move should allow me to explore more of the surrounding area while evaluating further actions for approaching the goal."
