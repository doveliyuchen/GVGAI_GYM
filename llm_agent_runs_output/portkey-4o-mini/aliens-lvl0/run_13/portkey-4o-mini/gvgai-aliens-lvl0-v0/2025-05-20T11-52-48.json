Additionally, there are bombs indicated by '%' at (5, 0) and (6, 0), which could be a concern for my health if I approach them directly.\n\nGiven that the enemies and bombs don't seem close enough to immediately threaten me, the focus should be on a strategic movement to either engage enemies or eliminate openings for the enemy's spawn points, particularly aiming towards the left as I have started in a position where any further action can reposition me effectively.\n\nBased on the position of the avatar and the enemies, I will choose to move left:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action will potentially reposition my avatar closer to engaging or getting a better shooting angle at the alien threats, adhering to the strategy of positioning for an offensive advantage."
