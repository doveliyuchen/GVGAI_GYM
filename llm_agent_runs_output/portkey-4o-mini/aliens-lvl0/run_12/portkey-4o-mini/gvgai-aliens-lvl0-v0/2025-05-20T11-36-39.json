There's urgency in attacking the enemy spawn points as soon as possible and ensuring your avatar is not surrounded.\n\n### Strategic Actions\nGiven your current position and the context of gameplay, the action should prioritize:\n- **Movement**: Getting into a better position to either attack enemies or evade incoming threats.\n- **Shooting**: Engaging any nearby enemies if feasible.\n\nSince the last action and current position of your avatar must be taken into account, let's choose an action that prioritizes movement to give better options in the following turns.\n\n### Chosen Action\nTo proceed effectively, I will make my avatar move right to `(10, 1)`:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n**Feedback on the Action**: Moving right allows me to open up possibilities for other actions in the next turn while keeping the option open to engage nearby attackers.
