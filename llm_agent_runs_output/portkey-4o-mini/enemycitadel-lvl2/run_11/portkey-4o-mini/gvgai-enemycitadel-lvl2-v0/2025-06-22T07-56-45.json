The nearest enemy is quite far, providing a buffer of safety primarily due to walls and obstacles.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. **Environmental Awareness**: The area around the avatar is relatively open in the up and down directions, with possible interactions with the round hole just below.\n2. **Utilize Holes**: The round hole could be leveraged either by moving into it (if needed for manipulation) or used to score if boulders are placed into it.\n3. **Avoid Direct Contact**: Currently, there are no immediate threats as enemies are one row above the avatar.\n4. **Health Management**: The avatar's health appears stable, as there are no immediate threats (enemies aren't in the vicinity).\n5. **Plan Movements**: Moving down could potentially lead to positioning near the hole.\n\nGiven the current avatar's position (4, 2), a reasonable action would be to move **down** towards the round hole at (5, 2), where there may be strategic advantages and potential scoring opportunities.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis downwards action is expected to move the avatar closer to the round hole, facilitating further positioning or manipulation in subsequent moves."

One immediate concern is the enemy at (1, 12), which is directly above the goal at (9, 12) but has no immediate threat as it is three rows above our avatar. \n\nTo begin with, we consider the optimal first move. The optimal next location for the avatar involves moving towards clear pathways without encountering enemies.\n\n1. **Left to (4, 1)**: Results in moving left among empty space ('.').\n2. **Right to (4, 3)**: Also results in moving to more empty space ('.').\n3. **Down to (5, 2)**: While this moves down to a square hole ('&'), it could cause the next move to engage with enemies.\n4. **Up to (3, 2)**: This leads to an empty space ('.') above.\n\nGiven the above options, moving **right to (4, 3)** continues to create distance between the avatar and any potential threats while navigating towards the right side where we can utilize interactive environment elements better.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis move towards (4, 3) allows for further exploration of pathways and reduces immediate conflict with the enemies while progressing towards the goal.

Moving right to (4, 2) is preferable as it opens the path toward further interactions with crates.\n\n### Action Decision:\n1. **Moving left to (4, 0)** risks running into walls as it does not offer maneuverability.\n2. **Moving right to (4, 2)** would position directly next to a crate (at (4, 3)), allowing me to either push that crate or move further into an open area, avoiding the enemy.\n\nTherefore, I'll move **right to (4, 2)**.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should place my avatar next to a crate at (4, 3) and provide more opportunities to progress while avoiding the immediate threat.

The avatar is currently located at (row=3, col=2), and there's a wall to the left (column 1) and enemies nearby.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar needs to navigate through the level, making sure to avoid enemies that are located at (row=1, col=8) and (row=8, col=1 and 2).\n2. There are available objects (boulders and crates) in the vicinity, specifically:\n   - A boulder at (row=3, col=5) on the right.\n   - Another boulder at (row=4, col=4) below.\n3. The goal is located at (row=9, col=12), and there are holes that might interact beneficially if I manipulate the objects correctly.\n\n### Strategy Applied:\n- **Environment Awareness**: The right side is open but moving there brings me closer to the enemy at (row=1, col=8). Therefore, I should prioritize moving to avoid damage.\n- **Utilize Crates and Boulders**: I can potentially push the boulder (row=3, col=5) to clear the path.\n- **Avoid Direct Contact**: My health is a priority, so I'll take movements that ensure I don't come closer to enemies by accident.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince my avatar hasn't moved yet and there\u2019s a boulder directly adjacent to the right, I will first attempt to move to the right (to position (row=3, col=3)). This movement should not result in any immediate contact with the enemy while allowing potential for further progress.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nI expect this move will strategically place me for the next turn, where I can decide whether to manipulate the boulder or shift upwards or downwards as necessary based on the next state."

There's an enemy in (row=1, col=11), and another at (row=1, col=12) above in the interaction layer, which could be a threat given the grid layout.\n\n3. **Path Planning**: Moving downwards might provide the quickest route to the goal. The next row (row=5) beneath the avatar has an opening (0) that could be utilized.\n\n### Available Actions\n- **ACTION_UP (4)**: Would move the avatar to (row=3, col=2), which is clear, but does not progress towards the goal.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Moves the avatar to (row=5, col=2), which is also clear and necessary for progress.\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)**, **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: These do not apply, as they position the avatar sideways and likely block progress.\n\nSince the last action resulted in no movement (as confirmed by previous states), to further the strategy of advancing towards the goal, I will take **ACTION_DOWN**.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nMoving downwards is expected to bring the avatar closer to the goal without engaging enemies.
