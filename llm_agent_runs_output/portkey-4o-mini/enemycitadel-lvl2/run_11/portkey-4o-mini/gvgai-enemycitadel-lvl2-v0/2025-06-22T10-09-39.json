There are several crates directly adjacent to the avatar that can be manipulated. \n2. Moving downward toward (5, 3) is dangerous due to the round hole; instead, we might want to consider lateral or upward movements where we have more control.\n3. Moving left to (4, 2) would help to possibly push a crate onto the hole or use it for other interactions.\n4. We also need to consider paths to eliminate the enemies or reach goals in the most efficient way while protecting health.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position may not respond to a simple action based on existing walls, let's attempt to move left. This will allow checking if we can push any crates or set up better further movements.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to (4, 2) is a strategic choice as it will allow us to manipulate the nearby crates and possibly eliminate threats while checking the surrounding layout. Let's see the outcome of this action to adjust further strategies accordingly."

Next, the square hole at (2, 8) might be something to consider later since there are boulders nearby that could be pushed towards it.\n3.

This boulder can potentially be pushed or rolled to interact with other holes or enemies.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the best immediate action would be to move towards a boulder which can lead to further options on the next turn. \n\nTherefore, I will take action to the right to (row=4, col=4):\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis positions my avatar next to the boulder, allowing for further interactions in the next turn.

The immediate positions around the avatar are as follows:\n   - Up (1, 6): boulder ('b')\n   - Down (3, 6): boulder ('b')\n   - Left (2, 5): empty ('.')\n   - Right (2, 7): empty ('.')\n\n2. The nearest goals are at (9, 12) which contains the goal sprite ('%').\n\n### Analysis:\nAt this moment, the avatar cannot move up or down due to the boulders blocking the way. The only potential movements for the avatar are left to (2, 5) or right to (2, 7). Since moving left leads to an empty space, and moving right also leads to an empty space, either path is viable purely for movement.\n\n### Strategy:\nHowever, moving will not change the state significantly unless a mechanism is in play to eliminate or reach goals or manage health effectively. From a strategic standpoint, I should aim to move towards places where I can interact with more sprites like crate ('#') or enemies ('$', or even manipulate the boulders effectively).\n\n### Decision:\nSince we are stuck between boulders and need to create opportunities, moving right (to (2, 7)) keeps us in a safe position due to enemies and could potentially allow for further movement on subsequent turns to interact with or avoid obstacles.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, which opens up further movement possibilities in the next turn while allowing us to avoid potential threats from enemies."

Moving **up** leads to another empty space (but doesn't advance towards any goals).\n5. Moving **down** leads similarly to an empty space.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nOne consideration is to systematically explore the area to find crates or boulders that I can use to clear the goals. Since there are various boulders in the vicinity, it could be beneficial to find a crate to interact with it. \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince no movement has occurred from the previous state, it seems prudent to take an action that keeps exploring nearby spaces to identify interactable elements. \n\nMy action will be to move up, as it doesn\u2019t seem to have a downside and I could discover more possibilities that lead towards my goals.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will help explore potentially valuable areas of the map and set up for future strategic interactions with crates or boulders."

    "content": "To determine the next action for the avatar, let's summarize the current state and the possible positions:\n\n- The avatar (**'a'**) is located at (1, 4).\n- There are several craters and enemies positioned nearby. Specifically, there is a **goal** at (9, 12) and numerous **enemies** ($) located at (1, 9) and (9, 1) which can damage the avatar if close.\n- The next significant interactive elements include crates (**'#'**) and boulders (**'@'**), which can be used strategically to achieve the objective of eliminating goals.\n\n### Choices and Strategies:\n1. Since the avatar is currently at (1, 4) with options to navigate:\n   - Moving **LEFT** (to (1, 3)), **RIGHT** (to (1, 5)), **UP** (to (0, 4)), or **DOWN** (to (2, 4)).\n  \n2. Analyzing each possible action:\n   - **LEFT (1, 3)**: This space is empty ('.'), so it does not provide additional strategic advantages and may also lead to a dead-end.\n   - **RIGHT (1, 5)**: This is also an empty space ('.'). This action can keep the avatar on the same row but is not directly helpful towards objectives.\n   - **UP (0, 4)**: This is also a wall ('b'), so this move is not valid.\n   - **DOWN (2, 4)**: This space is also empty ('.'), with potential to explore further options in the lower row.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position does not change from previous moves, it would be wise to explore further down.\n\n### Selected Action\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar downwards toward (2, 4) which is empty, allowing exploration of the next row where additional interactions may occur. I expect this will align with the strategy of seeking advantageous positions and opportunities for interaction."

The objectives include eliminating \"goal\" sprites (represented by `%`) while managing health and avoiding enemies. \n\n### Analyzing the Current State:\n- The avatar is surrounded by boulders, crates, open space, and a square hole directly to the right (at (2, 5)).\n- The closest goal is located at (9, 12).\n- There are enemies visible in the same row as the avatar at positions (1, 9) and (9, 1).\n- Crates and boulders can be used to manipulate elements in the environment for strategic movement.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\n1. **Position Check**: My current position does not change in this turn (i.e., using an action could potentially do no movement), so I need to analyze a move that positions the avatar advantageously with respect to manipulation of crates and avoidance of enemies and hazards.\n2. **Available Actions**: The options are to move left, right, up, or down from (2, 4):\n    - Moving **up** to (1,4): free space.\n    - Moving **down** to (3,4): boulder present.\n    - Moving **left** to (2,3): free space.\n    - Moving **right** to (2,5): square hole (no movement).\n\n### Best Action Choice:\nThe best move is to **move up** to (1, 4) which is a free space allowing for further movement to work around the enemies and push crates or boulders effectively in upcoming turns.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aligns with strategizing for future interactions while maintaining health and positioning away from immediate threats."
