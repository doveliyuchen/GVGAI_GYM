We must consider moving to a space that allows further movement toward the goal, managing health by avoiding enemies, and utilizing objects to manipulate obstacles.\n\n#### Action Planning:\nCurrently, the avatar can move:\n- **Left** (to (4, 3)), but this space is empty and does not progress us toward the goal.\n- **Right** (to (4, 5)), which is a boulder ('@'), indicating a potential for manipulation but doesn't directly help in reaching the goal.\n- **Down** (to (5, 4)), which would be a wall ('b'), hence not a valid move.\n- **Up** (to (3, 4)), which again is a boulder ('@'), similar to moving right.\n\nGiven the conditions:\n1. Moving **right** to (4, 5) allows interaction with a boulder.\n2. However, none of the moves lead directly toward the goal, so I need to be strategic in how I push boulders and manage positioning.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nBecause moving left or down is not feasible due to walls or empty spaces with no progress toward the goal, I will push the boulder to the right to create more opportunities for future moves.\n\n**Executing Action**:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action pushes the boulder at (4, 5) to the right, allowing for more flexibility next turn. I expect this aligns with my strategy of removing obstacles to pave the way toward the goal while managing the space around me effectively."

Moving one step to the left to (4,2) doesn't seem to lead toward the goal efficiently, while moving to the right (4,4) allows further potential movement toward the right side where there's a possibility of proceeding toward the goal.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will choose to move **right** to (4,4).\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nMoving right seems the most beneficial to maintain progress toward the goal without encountering immediate obstacles."
