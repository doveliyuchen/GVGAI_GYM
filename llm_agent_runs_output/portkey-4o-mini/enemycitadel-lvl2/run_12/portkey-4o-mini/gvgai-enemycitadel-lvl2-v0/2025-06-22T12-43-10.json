There is an enemy at (9, 1) and another at (1, 10) which needs to be avoided.\n2. **Crate/Boulder Interaction:** Moving boulders to block enemies is a potential strategy. \n3. **Health Management:** Since direct contact with enemies inflicts health loss, it's crucial to plan movements accordingly.\n\nSince the avatar's current position is surrounded by walls and boulders, the next logical action would be to move right without immediate enemy contact, yet there\u2019s a boulder at (4, 4) to the right. \n\n### Decision\nThe avatar can only move left towards an already placed obstacle or down towards another wall, rather than progressing along the direction of boulders or enemies.\n\nThus, a valid action to adapt to the boulder positioned directly to the right of the avatar is to **move UP**, back towards the path where there are more unexplored options or potential to rearrange the boulders.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should enable further strategic moves while maintaining distance from the enemy and assessing possible boulder placements.
