To navigate towards the goal ('%') at (9, 12), considering the nearby obstacles and enemies, the best course of action seems to be to first analyze the immediate surroundings of the avatar.\n\nThe movements available to the avatar are left, right, down, or up. Looking at the cell above (1, 7) is empty, (2, 6) contains a boulder ('b'), (2, 8) is a square hole ('*') which gives limited tactical utility, and to the left (2, 6) is also a boulder. The immediate surroundings suggest that moving down (to (3, 7)) might open up more space or interactions, as there are more empty cells down (3, 7) leading to potential paths around obstacles.\n\nThus, I will choose to move down, which allows us to explore further and avoid potential hazards from the surrounding boulders and walls.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nBy moving down, I expect to access more options for maneuvering towards the goal while avoiding immediate dangers."

There is a possibility to move toward the square hole which aligns with the goal of managing health and aiming for an advantageous position. \n\n### Expected Action\nGiven that moving closer to the goal without losing health is crucial and taking into account the spatial layout, a logical move would be to move **DOWN**.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should place the avatar directly above the square hole, creating opportunities for future interactions focused on scoring while safeguarding against enemy encounters."

    "content": "To proceed strategically, I need to analyze the current layout of the game board and determine the best action for the avatar based on its position and the surrounding entities.\n\n### Current State Breakdown:\n- **Avatar Position**: (2, 7)\n- **Goal Position**: (9, 12) - represented by `%`\n- **Enemies Present**: $ (located at (1, 12), (8, 2))\n- **Movable Objects**: Crates `#` and Boulders `@`, present in various locations.\n- **Health Points**: Starting with 30 Health Points.\n\nThe avatar is currently at (2, 7), positioned near a square hole (2, 8). Moving the avatar closer to the goal at (9, 12) is essential, but there are enemies nearby (the one at (1, 12) could pose a threat).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Maximize Distance from Enemies**: Moving towards the goal while maintaining a safe distance from the enemies is crucial.\n2. **Use the Environment**: The avatar can possibly use crates or boulders in future moves to create barriers or eliminate threats.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nThe (2, 7) position allows movement to (3, 7) (downward) to stay away from immediate threats. This position also looks open and does not bring immediate danger. \n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n**Feedback**: This action moves the avatar down to (3, 7), remaining evasive against enemies and avoiding confrontation while aiming to navigate towards the goal efficiently. I expect this to keep the health intact and set up for the following moves."
