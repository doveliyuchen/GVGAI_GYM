Given the current layout and the importance of not encountering the enemy directly, moving right is the most advantageous choice.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar to an empty space at (1, 2) and allows for more strategic options in subsequent moves while avoiding unnecessary damage from the enemy below."

Since the possible actions only allow the avatar to rotate or navigate carefully without direct movement into obstacles, careful consideration is required.\n\nThe most viable and strategic play involves moving **up (3,2)** to an empty cell (if the last position was unchanged) and evaluate further movements from there.

A move that doesn't change the position is less favorable, but since none of the options will result in any danger immediately or create obstacles, we should explore left, up, or right.\n\nGiven that I have previously analyzed the surrounding spaces, choosing to move left will allow us to explore the area without much risk.\n\n### Choosing the Action\nI will proceed to:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action moves the avatar left to (3, 1), which is an open space to further evaluate the layout.

It's crucial to use the crates or boulders to deal with them instead.\n\n1. **Plan your moves**: The enemy at (1, 8) could potentially come closer if I perform an action in that direction.

Since the enemy is blocking the path to other areas, it would be ideal to move towards it and use a crate to interact or move it into a boulder.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nGiven the current position of the avatar and the surroundings, the first action should be to check the right side for any possibility of movement.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action attempts to move the avatar to the right to position (2, 6).

The objective is to eliminate all goal sprites while keeping the avatar alive.\n\n### Analysis of Current State\n- The avatar is located at (4, 2).\n- To the left (4, 1) is a crate (#).\n- To the right (4, 3) is a boulder (@).\n- Below (5, 2) is a round hole (&).\n- Above (3, 2) is an empty space (.).\n\nGiven the rules, the goal needs to be our primary focus while avoiding enemies (denoted by '$'). Since I cannot see any immediate enemies near the avatar, I can move strategically.\n\n### Action Choice Process\n1. **Identifying Options**: My current movement options are limited to Up, Left, Right, and Down. \n   - Moving Left to (4, 1), interacting with the crate may set up a chance to eliminate the enemies below while positioning better.\n   - Right (4, 3) will lead to a boulder (@), but it's unclear how it can further complete objectives.\n\n2. **Best Tactical Move**: Moving Left to (4, 1) seems most beneficial. Not only does it get the avatar away from the boulder, but it also opens up options for further moves, especially concerning the crate situated there.\n\n### Action\nI choose to move Left.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis move should set up for further interactions with nearby objects, and I'm expecting to have more options for interacting with the entities without immediately risking health against enemies."
