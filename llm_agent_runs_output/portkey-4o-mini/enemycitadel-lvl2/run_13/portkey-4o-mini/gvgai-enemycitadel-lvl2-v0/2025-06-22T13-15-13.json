The crate at (row 4, col 2) could be moved to interact with some other sprite later, while moving down may allow for safer progress toward the exit.\n\nSince the avatar is currently at (row 4, col 3), I will move to (row 4, col 4), which is occupied by a boulder. This interaction will align with my strategy to optimize positioning for the next move but requires a later adjustment due to the potential for rotation.\n\n### Decision:\nI will execute the action to move RIGHT from (row 4, col 3) to (row 4, col 4). \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action allows for potential repositioning; I expect to see a rotation and prepare to plan my next move accordingly, considering the layout and remaining options."

Moving **LEFT** (Action 1) takes the avatar to (row=4, col=1), but it doesn't provide effective progress towards the goal.\n2. Moving **RIGHT** (Action 2) takes the avatar to (row=4, col=3), but that is a wall (b), and this is not a valid move.\n3. Moving **DOWN** (Action 3) takes the avatar to (row=5, col=2), where there is a round hole (&), meaning the avatar would be positioned above a hazard. This is not a preferred action.\n4. Moving **UP** (Action 4) would take the avatar to (row=3, col=2), which is still empty (.), allowing further movement options.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will move the avatar **UP** to (row=3, col=2) to explore further options for movement and potentially a better position to engage with boulders or maneuver towards the goal.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action serves to reposition the avatar while keeping health intact for future engagements and navigating towards the goal efficiently."

The direct path needs to be cleared while avoiding health loss.\n3. **Movement**: \n   - If the avatar moves left to (2, 6), it would be positioned at a background, which does not affect health.\n   - If the avatar moves down to (3, 7), it remains blocked by a boulder but could potentially explore other areas.\n   - If the avatar moves up, it will press against a boulder which does not help in reaching the goal.\n\nConsidering the immediate options and the lack of higher utility in moving further into walls or boulders, the most viable move for exploration would be to the left (2, 6) to assess the area further.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move to the left allows me to explore a background space and reassess the situation for more advantageous movements toward the goal."
