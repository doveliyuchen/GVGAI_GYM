The avatar ('a') is located at (4, 1) and can interact with crates ('#') and enemies ('$'). The objective is to reach the goal ('%') located at (9, 12).\n\nCurrently, the relevant layout around the avatar is as follows:\n\n- Row 4:\n  - (4, 0) -> b\n  - (4, 1) -> a\n  - (4, 2) -> .\n  - (4, 3) -> .\n  - (4, 4) -> .\n  - (4, 5) -> @\n  - (4, 6) -> b\n  - (4, 7) -> b\n  - (4, 8) -> #\n  - (4, 9) -> #\n  - (4, 10) -> #\n  - (4, 11) -> #\n  - (4, 12) -> #\n  - (4, 13) -> b\n\n- The next row (5) below has an enemy at (8, 2), and a round hole at (5, 2).\n\nGiven the surrounding environment:\n1. The avatar can interact with crates, moving them to clear paths or defeat enemies.\n2. Enemies should be avoided as they reduce the avatar's health, potentially leading to loss.\n3. The layout also features walls ('b') and holes which impact movement.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions\nFrom the current position at (4, 1), the avatar can only move:\n- **Left to (4, 0)** (but this is a wall 'b', not possible).\n- **Right to (4, 2)** (which is free).\n- **Down to (5, 1)** (which is free).\n- **Up to (3, 1)** (which is free).\n\nMoving up or right seems strategic but could lead to different outcomes. The safest immediate action to explore further options and keep health intact is to move right to (4, 2). This keeps potential enemies and hazards minimized while opening up a few more paths.\n\nThus, I will choose to take the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should help position myself better within the environment, and I look forward to manipulating crates or navigating closer to the goal in the next moves."

The most immediate threats are the enemies positioned vertically above the avatar's current position.\n\nHere are some potential actions to consider:\n1. Moving up (to (3, 2)) would place the avatar adjacent to enemies, which is risky.\n2. Moving down (to (5, 2)) keeps a safe distance from enemies and would allow interaction with another hole.\n3. Moving left (to (4, 1)) or right (to (4, 3)) would also avoid immediate threats but may not provide further opportunities to advance.\n\nTo maximize safety and strategically position the avatar, I will choose to move **down** to (5, 2), which will safely put more distance from the nearest enemies.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is a strategic decision to avoid potential harm from enemies while positioning the avatar to interact further with the environment.

Here are the possible immediate actions:\n\n1. **UP to (2, 2)** - Moves into an empty space.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 2)** - This move puts the avatar next to a boulder `@`.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 1)** - Moves into an empty space.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 3)** - Moves into an empty space.\n\n### Analyzing Moves\n- Moving **DOWN (to 4, 2)** stands out as it keeps the avatar near boulders that could potentially be useful in future moves. However, given that we might encounter one of the boulders, we should assess whether we can securely navigate without facing a health-loss situation from the `$` enemies.\n\n### Suggested Action\nTaking into consideration the strategic options that avoid enemy encounters while positioning better for future moves, the most beneficial next move appears to be:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis moves the avatar down to (4, 2). I'm expecting this action will position us optimally near boulders for potential future moves while also keeping a safe distance from immediate threats."

There is a goal at (9, 12) and various enemies represented by '$'. The pushing of enemies into holes or eliminating them strategically with crates could be beneficial, but no immediate enemies are adjacent to the avatar.\n\nSince the next best move should strategically position the avatar to control the surrounding area and avoid possible enemy encounters when navigating towards the goal (without immediate threats), I choose **downwards (ACTION_DOWN)** as this move keeps the avatar on the same path while moving closer to the area with crates (and potentially down further towards the goal).\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of exploring available pathways, controlling spacing for further maneuvers.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down appears to be a beneficial action as it opens further exploration of the map and remains close to potential interactions with crates that could assist in eliminating obstacles or enemies in future turns."

Avoid enemies to preserve health.\n2. Manipulate crates to potentially block enemies or clear paths.\n3. Plan movement to navigate towards the goal efficiently.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position was last noted as (4, 3), I will now assess potential actions based on this state:\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. Move **Left (3, 3)** \u2014 results in an empty ground.\n2. Move **Right (5, 3)** \u2014 there is a boulder at (4, 4), leading to a rotation but no immediate impact.\n3.

Move **Down (4, 4)** \u2014 hits a boulder at (4, 4).\n5. **Action Nil** \u2014 no change.\n\nThe most strategic move considering our goal is to maintain the avatar's position while exploring marine tactical advantages. Therefore, we will choose an action that doesn't minimize movement but can help position against enemies or indicate a potential move next%.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the position does not change due to many blocked paths or enemy threats, it\u2019s wise to **rotate** towards either up or down.\n\n**Action:** \n1. Moving left to (4, 2) seems viable if we respond with:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis should ideally allow exploration of the area to interact more favorably with crates or avoid enemies.

There are also crates '#' that can be used to manipulate the environment.\n\n### Analysis of Current Situation:\n1. **Health Management**: The enemy at (1, 9) is directly above my current position and poses a threat if I attempt to move vertically upwards. Moving left or right keeps me safe from the immediate enemy.\n2. **Immediate Actions**: Since moving up or down would either encounter walls or potentially an enemy (if I move upwards), I should consider moving left or right. Looking at the map:\n   - If I move left to (2, 1), I encounter a space.\n   - If I move right to (2, 3), I also encounter a space.\n\n### Strategy:\n- I want to stay away from enemies to preserve my health while strategically placing crates. \n- Moving left to (2, 1) keeps me safe and opens options for the next turn without losing health.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will proceed to move left towards (2, 1).\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis leftward move will allow me to safely avoid contact with the enemy while preparing for the next action. I expect to be in a better position for future turns."

This will provide more options in the following moves, while keeping potential threats (like enemies below) at bay.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should allow the avatar to navigate effectively towards the goal.

The immediate goal is to eventually reach the goal sprite (%), located at (9, 12).\n2. To maneuver safely, always check for nearby enemies before moving as they can deplete health.\n3. There's a need to maximize the use of crates to eliminate holes and enemies.\n\nSince the avatar has no immediate enemies nearby and can move in any direction without risk, we can opt for a strategic action. Moving right to (2, 3) is a reasonable choice as it opens up additional movement opportunities without any risk.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right is expected to provide a clear path for the next actions towards completing the objectives of removing obstacles and heading towards the goal."
