Since I am not currently able to engage with anything directly (no cigarettes in vicinity), moving up seems like a logical next step.\n\n**Selecting Action:** \n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n**Feedback:** Moving up should give me a strategic advantage by putting the \"quiet\" sprite into a closer proximity and help avoid any immediate threat from George.
