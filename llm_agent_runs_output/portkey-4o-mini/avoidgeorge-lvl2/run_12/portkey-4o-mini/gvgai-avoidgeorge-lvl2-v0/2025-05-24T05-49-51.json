However, avoid engaging with George at all costs since he results in negative scores.\n\n3. **Optimal Movement**: Since my avatar's position might not change directly due to surrounding threats, I should move down to (3, 21), which is still safe, and then I can evaluate the next moves based on the new position.\n\nChoosing to go down will ensure I avoid the area where George is while exploring more of the maze for potential quiet NPC interactions.\n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n``` \nAction:4 \n```\nThis action moves my avatar down to (3, 21), allowing me to reassess my surroundings and stay clear of George's immediate threat while looking for opportunities to maximize quiet NPC interactions."

The avatar's current position is **four rows above** George, which is safe for now, but remaining stationary is not advisable.\n  \n3. **Use Maze Navigation**: There are pathways to move towards quiet NPCs without getting too close to George.\n  \n4. **Time Management**: While the timer isn\u2019t specified here, focusing on scoring positively through NPC interactions is paramount.\n  \n5. **Plan Moves**: To interact with as many quiet NPCs as possible while evading George, I should move toward an accessible quiet NPC.\n\n### Possible Actions\n- **UP (ACTION_UP)**: Would lead the avatar to (2, 21) \u2013 there is no entity there.\n- **DOWN (ACTION_DOWN)**: Would move the avatar to (4, 21) \u2013 this is an empty position.\n- **LEFT (ACTION_LEFT)**: Moves to (3, 20) \u2013 also an empty position.\n- **RIGHT (ACTION_RIGHT)**: Moves to (3, 22) \u2013 also empty.\n\n### Best Action\nThe most strategic move is to go **UP (ACTION_UP)** to position (2, 21) because it keeps me further away from the rows where George is moving and allows me to explore interactions with quiet NPCs further while minimizing potential threats.\n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will position the avatar upwards towards interactions and help in avoiding any direct threat from George."
