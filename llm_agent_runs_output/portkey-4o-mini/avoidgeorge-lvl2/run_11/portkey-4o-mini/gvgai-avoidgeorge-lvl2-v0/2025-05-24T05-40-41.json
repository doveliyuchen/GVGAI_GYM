The promising move would be **downward (8,12) to (9,12)**, which positions the avatar away from George and into a clearer area.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down, which is a strategic reposition to avoid George and potentially explore new interactions in the subsequent turns."

Since the current state does not mention any items next to you, the focus would be on moving, specifically towards sprites that can assist in the transformation.\n\n### Action Selection\nYou need to check the possible moves available. The avatar can move in four directions (up, down, left, right). \n\nCurrently, the potential actions are:\n- Move **UP** to (row=7, col=6): This cell is empty (.)\n- Move **DOWN** to (row=9, col=6): This cell is also empty (.)\n- Move **LEFT** to (row=8, col=5): This cell is empty (.)\n- Move **RIGHT** to (row=8, col=7): This cell is empty (.)\n\nGiven this situation, moving **UP** to (row=7, col=6) seems strategic, as it may allow for future interactions with sprites nearby and contributes to navigating the map effectively.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up is expected to open up future paths and keep me engaged with the sprites in the next moves."
