These can be used to interact with George and convert him into an `&` sprite in the event of a chase.\n- **Potential Actions**: \n  - Moving left to (9, 15) or down (10, 16) won't help alleviate the threat since those directions won't move the avatar towards a useful position (the left is blocked by walls and the down is off the map).\n  - Moving up to (8, 16) doesn't help with the threats nearby, and there isn't an immediate benefit since interactions are not possible. \n\n### Best Action:\nSince the immediate positions for movement do not provide safe options and interactions, the **best decision** seems to be to use the **ACTION_USE** to potentially interact with the quiet sprites around, which might convert any annoyance or assist in avoiding the chase. However, before that, it is crucial to stay vigilant to avoid being caught while attempting to interact.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is expected to utilize the item for optimal sprite management as per the strategy suggested.
