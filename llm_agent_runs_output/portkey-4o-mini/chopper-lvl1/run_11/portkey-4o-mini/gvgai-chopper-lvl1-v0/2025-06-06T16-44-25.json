Notably, directly below me at (5, 1) there is an 'x' (which could potentially involve combat).\n\n**Positioning Strategy:**\nSince my avatar's last action did not change positions, I have to plan for a meaningful movement. The best course of action is likely to shift to a location where I can position myself away from threats and potentially target those `satellite sprites (f)`.\n\nConsidering moving **down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (5, 1) where an enemy (sam x) resides could put me in danger, but I may also need to attack to clear out immediate threats.
