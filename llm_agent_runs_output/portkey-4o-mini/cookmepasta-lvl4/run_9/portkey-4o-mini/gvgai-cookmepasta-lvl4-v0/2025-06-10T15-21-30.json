I currently have access to the boiling water ('@') at (8, 7). This is essential for cooking the raw pasta, which is located at (6, 6). However, to produce any meaningful transformation, we'll eventually need to reach the pasta first.\n\n3. The next step is to move towards the boiling water or collect ingredients on the way since I must avoid moving into a wall or making an un productive move.\n\n### Planned Action\nSince I am one tile away from the boiling water and there's nothing blocking me on the left side, I will move right (from (8, 1) to (8, 2)) to either collect ingredients or increase my proximity to useful items.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves my avatar closer to the boiling water, allowing potential future combinations with raw pasta once I move towards it, in line with the strategy of making necessary ingredient transformations."

This allows for exploration of other potential ingredients and spaces that may contribute towards the final dish.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving UP seems like a strategic choice as it enables the avatar to explore further potential arrangements without being blocked by walls."

The closest item I might need is the boiling water at (8, 7). If I move towards it, I will be able to interact with it, but I am currently facing right.\n2. There are also walls ('b') blocking many paths, requiring careful navigation.\n\n**Considering my current position (8, 2) and facing right, I will execute the action to move right to (8, 3)**. \n\nExecuting this action is part of my strategic approach to position myself closer to the boiling water and prepare for the next steps in cooking:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should bring me closer to the boiling water, aligning with my objective of preparing the food.

Since walls block some directions, we should prioritize moving to open spaces.\n\n#### Action Choice\n- Moving **LEFT** to (9, 1): `.` (empty) is a viable option, potentially leading to a more beneficial situation.\n- Moving **RIGHT** or **UP** is blocked by walls or would just shift to other empty spaces without immediate gain.\n- Moving **DOWN** is not possible since walls exist vertically below.\n\nGiven that our avatar's position would change if we move left, I will choose to take that action.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nI expect this action will keep me progressing in the game by exploring new areas while adhering to the mechanics of avoiding wall collisions."

This aligns with our strategy of manipulating ingredients to achieve the desired 'plateinplace'.\n\n### Available Actions\n- **Action 1 (LEFT)**: Move to (3,5) which is an empty spot.\n- **Action 2 (RIGHT)**: Move to (3,7) which is also an empty spot.\n- **Action 3 (DOWN)**: Move to (4,6) which is empty.\n- **Action 4 (UP)**: Move to (2,6) where the raw pasta is located.\n\n### Chosen Action\nI will choose to move upward to acquire the raw pasta, which is essential for crafting pasta dishes:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action is aligned with the strategy since it aims to interact with a necessary ingredient, progressing toward producing 'plateinplace'."

Thus, I will choose to move right to (3, 6).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right is expected to yield an empty space which will allow further navigation and assess what potential items (if any) can be reached next."
