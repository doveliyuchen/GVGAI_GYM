Additionally, there is a raw pasta (%) located at (6, 6) that can be used in our dish.\n\nFollowing the strategy, we should first consider collecting the raw pasta since it\u2019s a key ingredient. The only available move from the current position (3, 6) is to move down to (4, 6), but that is a wall. Thus, I should move up or down again, but it's evident that down and up won't reach any of the ingredients or necessary items.\n\nIn this case, let's analyze the sprite layout for possible rotations. Moving left (to (3, 5)) is blocked, moving right (to (3, 7)) is also blocked, down (to (4, 6)) is blocked, and up (to (2, 6)) is also blocked by walls. So, moving back up to the last position may allow us to rotate without change but also limited options.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to act upwards again as a rotation to analyze the possible directions when it is free:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action will ensure that the avatar attempts to rotate and check the possible moves again, perhaps avoiding being locked. I expect the game's state landscape would adequately shift on the next state to access or strategically prepare for future necessary interactions."

However, there are other ingredients scattered throughout the map that may be necessary for creating the desired 'plateinplace,' such as raw pasta at (6, 6) and a key at (5, 8). To move forward strategically, it's essential to gather resources and use them wisely without landing on any incorrect combinations, which could lead to a 'wrongplace' scenario.\n\nGiven that your position can either rotate without moving or you may have the opportunity to execute a movement-based action, let\u2019s analyze the next best action. Since you can't yet reach the boiling water and you're two moves away from a critical ingredient, I suggest the following:\n\n1. **Move left to (7, 1)**: This position allows you to explore further while maintaining the option to gather ingredients.\n\nI'll take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow further exploration to either gather the raw pasta or set up for future movements."

The next logical action is to move closer to the raw pasta or the boiling water to facilitate making the dish.\n\nLet's first move UP to see if that brings us closer to a beneficial action.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should move my avatar up to row 7, col 2, allowing exploration of the layout and possible access to more ingredients or items.
