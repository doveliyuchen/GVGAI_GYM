The strategy suggests you should prioritize collecting the key and moving towards the ingredients to prepare dishes.\n\n1. **Plan the route**: Moving downward to collect the key allows access to more ingredients. \n2. **Action outline**: \n   - Moving down (to (2, 7)) keeps you in the right area to eventually access the key or raw pasta.\n  \n### Action Decision\nTaking the above observations into account, the best action you can take right now is to **move down**.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to help you progress towards collecting the key and moving closer to the ingredients you need to complete your objective."

Collecting the key early will allow you to unlock areas, especially since access to the cooking resources is crucial.\n\n### Possible Moves\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2, 1, 6)** - This will lead to an empty tile; however, it doesn\u2019t bring you closer to any resources of importance.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2, 1, 8)** - This will also lead to an empty tile with no immediate benefit.\n3. **ACTION_UP (0, 1, 7)** - This moves into a wall; thus it's invalid.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (2, 1, 7)** - This moves into a wall; thus it's invalid.\n5. **ACTION_NIL** - This does not change anything.\n\n### Strategic Recommendation\nSince the critical resources (the key, boiling water, and pasta) are located further away, one strategy would be to move towards the key first. Getting the key will enable access to locked areas, thereby allowing you to access more resources and potentially create dishes.\n\n### Decision\nGiven that the walls limit our movements above and below, I will move left or right. However, since both left and right are empty, moving right allows me to maintain proximity to potential resources in the near future.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right is permissible, and I expect to navigate towards tiles that could prove beneficial later as I plan my next moves."

Collect the key early on to unlock opportunities in the game.\n2.

We have boiling water at (8, 3), which is an essential ingredient for cooking.\n2. Moving towards the boiling water will allow us to build the dishes we need.\n3. The left and down moves lead to empty tiles, while moving up would not provide any advantage. \n\nGiven the available actions, moving right towards the boiling water is the most beneficial step that aligns with our strategy of collecting resource elements needed for cooking.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the chosen action is to move right to the boiling water.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis will hopefully bring us closer to creating dishes, aligning perfectly with our objective of combining ingredients effectively."

Nearby, we can identify:\n\n- Row 8, Column 1: empty space (.)\n- Row 8, Column 3: boiling water (@)\n- Row 8, Column 4: empty space (.)\n- Row 7, Column 2: empty space (.)\n\nGiven that the boiling water is right next to your avatar and combining it with the right ingredient is crucial for cooking, the next logical move is to collect it.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right (from column 2 to column 3), successfully collecting the boiling water. This step aligns with the strategy of collecting resources and positioning oneself effectively to create dishes without hitting the wrongplace counter. I expect to have the boiling water available for later combinations with ingredients."

The immediate surroundings include several interactive elements:\n\n- **Above (7, 2):** empty floor (.)\n- **Below (9, 2):** empty floor (.)\n- **Left (8, 1):** empty floor (.)\n- **Right (8, 3):** boiling water (@)\n- **Key position (5, 8):** located above your row.\n- **Accessing the ingredients:** The closest ingredient to you is the boiling water, which can help create the dish once you have the raw pasta.\n\n### Current Assessment\nTo effectively progress in the game:\n1. Your immediate goal can be to access the boiling water to pair with any raw pasta you can collect.\n2. Collecting the key would also be beneficial as it may lead to accessing other helpful items or ingredients.\n\n### Next Move\nSince moving towards the right (to the boiling water) allows you to interact with it immediately, this is a sensible next action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis should help you gather the boiling water, which is crucial for cooking the raw pasta later. I expect this aligns well with the strategy of planning ahead by utilizing nearby resources effectively."
