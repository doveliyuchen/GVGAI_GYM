You need to gather the raw pasta, which is accessible at (6, 6). However, since your immediate goal is to create the dish efficiently, here's the approach I'd recommend based on the game mechanics.\n\n1. **Retrieve the Key**: As you cannot pass through the lock without the key, the first action should involve reaching the key located at (5, 8).\n2. **Unlock the Path**: After acquiring the key, move towards the lock at (1, 3) and unlock it to access other ingredients more easily.\n\nGiven your current position, the action that needs to be taken first is to move down towards the key.\n\n### Action Decision\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action will move the avatar down to (2, 4).

As part of this process, we have to first cook the raw pasta. However, since we do not have raw pasta in our vicinity yet (which is located at `(row=5, col=4)`), our first step should be to collect the raw pasta to proceed with cooking.\n\n### Analyzing the next best action:\nGiven the current position `(row=9, col=5)`, the available actions are:\n- Move left to `(row=9, col=4)` where boiling water is available. This is useful, but we need raw pasta first.\n- Move right to an empty space `(row=9, col=6)` which doesn't help us towards our goal.\n- Move down to `(row=10, col=5)` which is also a wall.\n- Move up to `(row=8, col=5)` which is empty too.\n\n### Best course of action:\nSince moving left does not lead us to a suitable state towards reaching raw pasta, the most logical move would be to head towards the raw pasta located above us. Hence, I will first move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis move is expected to place me in a position where I can strategize better towards reaching the raw pasta subsequently."

Gather the **raw pasta** at (5, 4).\n2. Move to **boiling water** at (9, 4) to cook the raw pasta.\n3. Combine cooked pasta with sauces made from tomatoes (if available) and tuna.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Actions\nTo reach the raw pasta located at (5, 4) from the avatar at (8, 6), I need to move **up**.\n\n#### Expected Moves\n- **First Action**: Move **UP** from (8, 6) to (7, 6) -- the spot (7, 6) is a clear space.\n- If successful, continue moving **UP** again toward (6, 6) and then (5, 6) to get closer to the pasta.\n\nSince the avatar hasn't moved since the last status check, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMy expectation is to successfully move the avatar up toward the raw pasta without encountering barriers."
