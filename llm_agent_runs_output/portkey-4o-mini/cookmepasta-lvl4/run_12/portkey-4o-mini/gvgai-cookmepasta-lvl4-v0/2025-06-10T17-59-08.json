The primary objective right now is to collect the ingredients needed for the plate, particularly the raw pasta.\n2. The avatar should first attempt to navigate the walls to reach the raw pasta. The levels appear to have limited immediate moves since there are walls in the way.\n3. Moving either to (6, 6), which is an open space, or maneuvering further down is likely a productive next step to create an opportunity to access the raw pasta.\n\nGiven that the only nearby options lead to exploration of open space, I will proceed to move the avatar down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows for a potential exploration and a pathway toward gathering more ingredients, keeping in line with the previously established strategy."
