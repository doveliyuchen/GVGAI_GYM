I should ensure they remain safe while also looking for opportunities to attack aliens.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Given that I need to keep moving to avoid being stagnant in a potentially hazardous position, I should prioritize moving into a better attacking position without retreating from the danger.\n\n### Action Decision\n- Since my avatar can rotate but hasn't moved, it may be beneficial to move either left or right to be able to engage with the aliens effectively without being too far away. \n\nChoosing to move right is a reasonable option since it helps me closer to the potential area where aliens can originate as they spawn and also keeps me positioned near the bases.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to potentially align with my strategy by getting closer to engaging with aliens while staying safe near my base."
