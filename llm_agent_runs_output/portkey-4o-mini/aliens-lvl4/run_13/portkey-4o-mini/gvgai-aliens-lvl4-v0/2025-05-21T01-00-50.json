Therefore, I suggest moving to the left to navigate safely while avoiding the adjacent bombs.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis will allow you to reposition your avatar and maintain distance from potential threats while keeping an eye on strategic moves for subsequent turns."

Since the avatar has the opportunity to use an offensive action, this will help manage the alien threat.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow your avatar to shoot at the aliens above, aligning with the strategy of preventing them from reaching your base and potentially managing your score more effectively."

The nearest alien (@) is located at (9, 0) \u2014 further away and not an immediate concern.\n3. **Base Location**: The base is located above the avatar at (7, 6) through (7, 9). This base should be protected.\n4. **No Active Spawning Portals**: There are no portals (1 or 2) in the immediate vicinity of the avatar. This allows for some freedom of movement.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo adopt a proactive strategy in managing the game's objectives, the next step will be to **move the avatar either left or right** to maintain flexibility in approaching targets or evading potential threats. Given that there are no immediate aliens within striking range and considering the overall spacing on the map, moving **LEFT (2)** will position the avatar closer toward an area that can have possible tactical advancements against subsequent alien threats.\n\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\n\nBy moving left, I can realign the avatar's position for a better attack arc on aliens while keeping close to the base for defense.

According to the game rules and overall strategy, I need to take an action that helps me manage the ongoing threat from the alien sprites and enhances my scoring potential.\n\nLooking at the map, I see that the avatar is relatively safe at the moment, but there are many alien sprites in the rows above, particularly in row 0 (which has multiple @ sprites) and below in rows 1 and 2. To avoid being caught by any stray attacks and considering that previous positioning is crucial, I want to ensure I can target the incoming threats efficiently.\n\nSince the avatar hasn't moved before this action, I should consider moving either left or right. Moving left (to (row=10, col=2)) is an option, but there are significantly fewer threats in that column.
