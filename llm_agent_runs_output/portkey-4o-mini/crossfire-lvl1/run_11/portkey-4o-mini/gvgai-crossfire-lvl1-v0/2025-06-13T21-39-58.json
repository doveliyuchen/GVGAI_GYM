To win, the avatar must reach the goal located at (row=10, col=9), while avoiding hazards such as walls, bombs, and turrets.\n\nTurrets appear to be located at various points, notably at (row=4, col=9) and (row=4, col=18), as well as along rows with bomb hazards. There are also bomb entities located throughout the level.\n\nFrom the avatar's current position, moving to the left (col=28) will move the avatar closer to the goal's row while avoiding immediate danger. However, before making this move, it's essential to confirm that turrets and bombs aren\u2019t directly in the path.\n\n### Action Decision\nMoving **left** to (row=2, col=28) is the best immediate action because it helps to minimize the risk of collision with bombs while getting closer to pathways that lead down towards the goal row.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis left action allows for reassessment of the surrounding hazards and provides opportunities for continued movement toward the goal."

Assessing the surrounding area indicates that you are at the edge and the wall (%), which could restrict movement options. The goal ('#') is located at (row=10, col=9), and there are multiple hazards nearby, including bombs ('&') from turrets ('@') and environment structures.\n\nGiven that the player's goal is to reach the green door (goal) while avoiding hazards, your immediate next move should be to analyze where to proceed from the current position. You need to avoid heading directly either into turrets or areas where bomb drops may occur.\n\nBased on analysis, the best action is to move UP (to (row=1, col=29)), as it will progress you away from immediate bomb zones and wall feedback while keeping options open for future movement down toward the goal path.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nFeedback: This action aligns with the strategy of cautiously planning movements around hazards while aiming towards eventual goal completion. I expect this action to allow for safer navigation in the upcoming moves."

This will keep me away from the immediate danger of the turret at (5, 18).\n2. **Avoiding Hazards:** Moving left will allow me to assess the next steps without approaching bombs too closely or being in range of the turret's bomb-generating cycle.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move shifts my position left to (3, 28) and allows me to analyze the next state without getting closer to any immediate threats.
