The area around the avatar is mostly blocked by walls or occupied by the turrets. \n\n### Strategy Execution:\nSince your avatar's position remains unchanged, it indicates a need to take a more calculated action to advance towards the goal while avoiding negative interactions with bombs. Moving left is blocked by walls, and the same is likely for down due to the turrets' firing range.\n\nWith the goal being directly downwards, a temporary protective movement up seems necessary to create space. This action will allow for reassessing the situation below while possibly avoiding immediate damage from the bomb turrets.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up to (0, 20), providing a chance to reevaluate the situation and potential paths toward the goal without direct confrontation with the bomb turrets."
