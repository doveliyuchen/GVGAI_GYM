Both moves will help me reposition without immediate danger from enemies or walls.\n\nSince moving down (2, 15) maintains more options in the next turn (it opens up paths to subsequently move left or right and potentially closer toward the goal), I will choose that direction.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis should help in progressing towards the goal while ensuring safe navigation."

The surroundings contain walls ('%') which I can use for protection.\n\nSince my last action had the avatar's position unchanged, I must evaluate the actions I can take from my current position. Moving left, right, down, or up needs to ensure I don't run into any bombs or direct turret fire.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n- **Left (2, 14)**: There is a wall (%), so this move is invalid.\n- **Right (2, 16)**: There is a wall (%), so this move is invalid.\n- **Down (3, 15)**: This move is valid as there is an open space (.).\n- **Up (1, 15)**: This move is valid as there is an open space (.).\n\n### Strategy:\nTo avoid imminent danger from turrets while moving towards the goal, I can either move down to (3, 15) or up to (1, 15). Evaluating the map, moving down keeps me closer to potential paths to the exit while avoiding any immediate threats. \n\nI'll proceed with the action to move down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to keep my avatar safe while positioning me for future moves towards the goal."
