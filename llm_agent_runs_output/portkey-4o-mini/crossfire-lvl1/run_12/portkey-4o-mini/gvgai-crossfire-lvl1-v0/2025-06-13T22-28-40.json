The path should minimize any collisions from bombs and turrets.\n2. **Avoid Hazards**: Moving carefully is key since I want to avoid triggering bombs or getting too close to turrets.\n3. **Plan Movement**: I can consider moving downwards since it's open (to position (2, 23)), allowing for further navigation toward the goal while maintaining distance from turrets.\n\n### Next Action\nSince the avatar did not move, I will act cautiously and move down to (2, 23).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should keep me safe while allowing me to explore the lower rows which might facilitate movement toward the goal."
