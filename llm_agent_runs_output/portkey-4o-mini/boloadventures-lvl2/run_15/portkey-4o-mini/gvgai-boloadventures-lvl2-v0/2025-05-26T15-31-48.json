The strategy focuses on planning moves carefully to avoid hazards and reach the goal ('$') at (4, 29).\n\nSince I can move, I should first check if there are any blocks or other mechanisms I can use to navigate towards the goal. My current position allows me to try moving right to (7, 3), which appears to be an open space.\n\nI will proceed with the action to move right:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action seems aligned with the strategy as it helps progress towards the goal while keeping me away from hazards.

The goal '$' is located at (row=4, col=29). \n\nThe surrounding area seems to have various obstacles and hazards, including boulders '@' and lasers (indicated by 'w' and 'e'). \n\nStarting from the current avatar position, the immediate strategy should focus on moving toward the goal while circumventing the hazards. I'll assess the nearby space:\n\n- To the left (col=2) and right (col=4) there are unobstructed paths (represented by '.') which seem safe. \n- Above (row=6, col=3) is empty ('.') and below (row=8, col=3) also has a boulder ('@').\n\nGiven this analysis, my best action is to move **RIGHT (to col=4)** since that leads away from obstacles while keeping me on track toward my goal. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should allow progress toward the goal while avoiding immediate hazards according to the strategy discussed."
