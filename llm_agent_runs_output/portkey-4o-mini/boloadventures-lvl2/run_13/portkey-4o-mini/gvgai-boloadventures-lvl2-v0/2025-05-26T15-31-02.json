Moving left (7, 2) keeps us safe and allows for potentially better positioning.\n2. Moving down (8, 3) also keeps us safe and continues to explore the empty ground.\n\nTo decide on an action, moving down may be the preferable choice since it keeps more options open for future movements (like moving to the right into a clearer area).\n\nThus, I will take the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\n\nI expect this action will lead us to (8, 3) on clear ground, allowing for future safe movement without the risk of lasers."

The path to the goal is clear from an aerial perspective, with some horizontal movement needed.\n2. As per the game rules, it seems necessary to avoid traps while navigating, with the primary focus on reaching the goal directly.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe immediate effective move should be to move right to (7, 4) since the next column is free, allowing us to progress toward the goal. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to help traverse through the level safely while edging closer to the goal, adhering to our overall strategy of careful navigation."
