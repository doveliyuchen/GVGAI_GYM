The avatar is currently surrounded by several interactive elements:\n   - To the left (8, 1) is empty (ground).\n   - To the right (8, 3) is also empty (ground).\n   - Directly above (7, 2) is empty (ground).\n   - Directly below (9, 2) is a wall.\n\nTo progress towards the goal at (4, 29), moving either left or right won't get us close to the goal, nor does it put us in a strategic position against any immediate threats. The best option appears to be moving upward to (7, 2), which is still within the safe zone and offers alternative paths to explore for optimal movement towards the goal.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to move **up**.\n\n``` Action:4 ```  \nThis action shifts the avatar upward and helps to explore potential paths toward the goal while keeping safe from hazards."

The ground around you has only one box (#) located at (4, 2), which is not currently accessible without first moving.\n\nConsidering the immediate actions available:\n\n- Action UP (to (6, 2)) brings you on top of a boulder (@).\n- Action DOWN (to (8, 2)) will transition to open ground (.), but doesn't seem to progress towards the goal.\n- Action LEFT (to (7, 1)) and RIGHT (to (7, 3)) would either lead to empty space (.) or another open area.\n\nThe most beneficial move is to go UP, as it brings the avatar closer vertically to the boulders, which I can strategize around next.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action is a logical step toward using the available boulders for strategic plays, opening further options to navigate through the level efficiently."
