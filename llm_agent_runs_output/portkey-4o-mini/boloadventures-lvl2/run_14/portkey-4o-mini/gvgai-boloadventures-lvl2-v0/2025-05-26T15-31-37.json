Moving right or down seems to provide pathways toward the right side where the goal is located.\n\nSince all movements left, right, or down are safe but only movements toward the right seem beneficial for progressing toward the goal without encountering hazards, I will choose to move right first.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action aims to move your avatar closer to the goal while keeping the movements safe from hazards.
