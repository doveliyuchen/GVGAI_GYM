The surrounding state includes:\n\n- Row 6 (above) has hazards in the form of boulders ('@') and walls ('*').\n- Row 5 (below) also contains a boulder to the right (column 9).\n- Column 4 has a hole ('w') further to the right of the avatar.\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar reveal walls on the left and right (columns 2 and 4 respectively).\n\nGiven the situation, the avatar is effectively trapped on the left side, surrounded by walls and a boulder on the right. To proceed, I need to try moving right towards column 4. However, I must also consider that action might first rotate the avatar.\n\nI will choose to move right to avoid the hole and try to navigate past the wall on the right. Thus, I will select:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should allow for an effective movement towards the goal while avoiding immediate hazards. My expectation is to successfully move to a safer position on the right."
