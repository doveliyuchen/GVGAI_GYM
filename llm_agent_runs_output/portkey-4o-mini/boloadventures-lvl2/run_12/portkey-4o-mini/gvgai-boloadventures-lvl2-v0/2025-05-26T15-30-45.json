The strategy involves navigating towards the goal and avoiding any obstacles, especially the boulders '@' and the lasers represented by '%' that are positioned within the level.\n\nNow, let's analyze the immediate surroundings of the avatar:\n- To the immediate left (row=7, col=1) is an empty space ('.').\n- To the immediate right (row=7, col=3) is also an empty space ('.').\n- Up (row=6, col=2) contains a boulder ('@').\n- Down (row=8, col=2) has an empty space ('.').\n\nGiven that the goal is further to the right and considering the barriers presented by the boulders, I can attempt to move right (even if it is just to clear the avatar's movement).\n\nFollowing the strategy of optimizing movement and planning towards the goal, I will take action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is expected to move the avatar closer to the goal while keeping the potential for further navigation options open."

Next to the avatar is a wall below it at (8, 4) and boxes at (7, 8) and (7, 6). \n\nSince the goal is to maneuver towards the goal sprite ('$') at (4, 29), and given the presence of obstacles like boulders and lasers around, I will try to evaluate possible moves.\n\nFrom the current observation, the immediate downward action will result in an interaction with the ground (8, 4) where the wall is. To make progress, I should look left or right towards the box.\n\nThe best move to explore the area and also seek a potential path towards the goal will be to try moving **RIGHT** toward (7, 4). \n\nFollowing my strategy of analyzing the route and avoiding immediate threats or dead ends, I will choose the next action.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will help me explore the right side and potentially lead to breakthroughs toward the goal while keeping the strategy of planning my route effectively in mind."
