Consider the available actions and focus on moving strategically toward potential hidden objects or tiles that may interact with your staff or change your current light state.\n2. Since moving a direction could create a rotation without movement, we will need to initiate directional movements in succession if the first action doesn\u2019t change the position.\n3.

The avatar is located at (row=6, col=7), surrounded by floor spaces ('.') and walls ('$') in the neighboring rows and columns.\n\nSince our avatar is positioned on the floor and surrounded by walkable areas, we can consider moving in one of the available directions to explore and interact with the environment. However, since rotation might occur without movement in some cases, we should first check if moving down would bring us closer to any interactive elements.\n\nLooking around:\n- Directly below the avatar (at (row=7, col=7)) is a wall ('$'), which means moving down is not an option.\n- To the left (at (row=6, col=6)) is a floor ('.'), which allows for movement.\n- To the right (at (row=6, col=8)) is also a floor ('.'), allowing movement right.\n\nGiven that we haven't moved yet, moving left or right are the options. Moving left would allow exploration of more space horizontally along row 6, but could also lead to a dead-end since row 5 below it seems occupied by walls and floors. \n\nMoving right would allow for similar exploration, with more potential to access row 5 and potentially uncover more sprite interactions. Therefore, I will choose to move right, as it could lead us to more dimensional exploration.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action will help me explore the rightward space and may lead to further interactions with other game elements, enhancing my understanding of the environment."
