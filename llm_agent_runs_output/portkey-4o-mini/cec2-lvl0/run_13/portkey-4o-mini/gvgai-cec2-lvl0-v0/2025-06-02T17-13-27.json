Make a directional move to closely assess my options.\n2. Ensure I do not get stuck or run out of time.\n\nSince the most immediate adjacent tile to the north (4, 2) is a wall ($), I cannot move there. Moving left or right also doesn't yield any beneficial tiles immediately.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to check if there's an interaction available that may position the avatar better for converting or utilizing other 'ok' tiles.\n\nLet's try moving down to (6, 2), which is an open space ('.') to decide the next steps better. Based on the layout, further immediate moves could become clearer.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action indicates I\u2019m moving down to (6, 2) which opens up more options for the next turns.
