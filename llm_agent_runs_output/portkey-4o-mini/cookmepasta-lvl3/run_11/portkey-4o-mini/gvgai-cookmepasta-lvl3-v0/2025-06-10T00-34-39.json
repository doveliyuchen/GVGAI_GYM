We are near an area with a key on the left (7, 5) and boiling water below (8, 3).\n2. Moving right (to 7, 8) will not lead to immediate collection but opens up further movement in the next turns.\n3. Moving down (to 8, 7) brings us closer to the area where we have boiling water but could lead to further options depending on the layout.\n\n### Decision\nTo start advancing towards resources and potential cooking options while adhering to the strategic guidance of avoiding backtracking and making meaningful movements, I will opt to move right:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right opens up new avenues and could set up for the next turn without placing the chef in front of a wall.
