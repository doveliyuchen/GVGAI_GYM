However, moving left may not lead toward anything significant.\n\nAfter weighing my options, I will take the **ACTION_LEFT (1)**. This action keeps the avatar in a more navigable area while allowing potential future moves towards the key ingredient locations.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nMoving left to (9, 3) could provide better navigation options in the next turn and get closer to my goal of creating a dish."

The avatar needs a key to unlock the lock at (8, 10) but first needs to acquire ingredients to create a dish (plateinplace) as per the game strategy.\n\n### Strategy Insights:\n- **Gather Ingredients:** The first step suggested was to create the dish by turning raw pasta into pastainplace, which involves moving toward the raw pasta at (9, 7). The only option the avatar has to reach that ingredient is to move right to (9, 6) which leads to a wall, following the logic that it cannot go down or left.\n- **Next Steps:** If the move to the right fails due to walls, we need to position ourselves closer to possible ingredients or items essential for dish assembly.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nSince the right direction to (9, 6) is blocked by a wall, the avatar cannot move right. Therefore, the optimal action is to consider maneuvering directions. However, since the avatar cannot move or change position (because of wall constraints), it can only try to get around the wall by checking the other relevant nearby spaces:\n\n- **I will choose to take an action moving UP since it is the only space available to slightly navigate and possibly discover new paths or ingredients/assignments.** \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy and expectations of the game while taking into account current surroundings and proximity to items needed for the objective."
