The overall strategy includes:\n1. Collect the necessary ingredients (boiling water, raw pasta, tomato, tuna) in the correct order.\n2. Follow the optimal path to avoid backtracking as much as possible.\n3. Pay attention to combinations that lead to loss conditions.\n\n#### Actions Analysis\n- The avatar can move in four directions: left, right, up, down. \n- The key, which may unlock areas, is just two spaces to the left (from (7, 7) to (7, 5)). \n- Additionally, there is boiling water at (8, 3), and raw pasta is situated at (9, 7), indicating I need to prioritize moving towards the key first.\n\nSince the position of the avatar does not change from the previous actions, it makes sense to take an action that directly engages with the closest pickup, which is the key to open more areas.\n\n#### Chosen Action\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis will move the avatar left to collect the key at (7, 5). Collecting it is crucial for advancing in the game and might avoid dead ends later on. I expect this aligns with the strategy and opens up further options for gathering ingredients."

The main objectives involve collecting ingredients and utilizing them correctly to achieve a \"plateinplace\" status.\n\nFrom the current layout:\n\n- Boiling water ('@') is located at (8, 3).\n- Raw pasta ('%') is located at (9, 7).\n- Tuna ('*') is at (2, 4).\n- Tomato ('&') is at (2, 11).\n- The key ('#') is at (7, 5), which allows access to locked areas.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves\nBased on the avatar's position, the most beneficial action is to collect the boiling water ('@') located at (8, 3), as creating pasta requires boiling water.\n\n1. From (7, 7), you can move down to (8, 7), which is an empty space (.), and then move left to (8, 6), where again it is a wall (b). You would further need to make another move.\n2. Ultimately, moving straight down does not lead to immediate collection of ingredients, but offers some exploration.\n\nHowever, the movement toward the key ('#') at (7, 5) may also provide access to more options since it is useful for potentially unlocking areas later on.\n\n### Move Decision\nTo maximize choices and prepare for future actions, I will move towards the key first to potentially access locked areas.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI will move right to position (7, 8) to explore further. This action is strategic to potentially gather other ingredients or unlock useful areas for plate preparation."
