    "content": "To analyze the current game state, let's first identify where the avatar ('a') is located. The avatar is currently at (7, 7). Notably, there are several interesting items and features around the avatar, including a key ('#') at (7, 5), a lock ('$') at (8, 10), and boiling water ('@') at (8, 3).\n\nAccording to our strategy, we want to prioritize the collection of useful resources. Since there's a key nearby, it would be a good idea to collect that first, as it may allow us to navigate through locked areas later. \n\nTo collect the key, the avatar can move left to (7, 6), and then left again to (7, 5).\n\nTherefore, I will first move left to (7, 6).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should position the avatar closer to the key, allowing for quick access to it on the next move."
