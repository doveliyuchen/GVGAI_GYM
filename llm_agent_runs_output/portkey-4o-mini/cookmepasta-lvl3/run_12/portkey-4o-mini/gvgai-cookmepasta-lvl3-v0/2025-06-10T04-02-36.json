For now, given that the presence of a key (#) is just to the left near (row=7, col=5) but requires backtracking, the more direct approach would be towards the 'boilingwater' located below at (row=8, col=3) which we might need for our cooking.\n\n### Selected Action:\nThus, I will proceed with moving **down** to (8,8) to get closer to other potential ingredients (including potentially reaching the boiling water).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will help me to explore more options in the vicinity of the boiling water and the overall layout, aligning effectively with the strategy of gathering crucial resources to prepare the plateinplace."

The immediate items of interest around the avatar are as follows:\n\n- **(Row 7, Col 5)**: Key (symbol '#')\n- **(Row 7, Col 6)**: Wall (symbol 'b')\n- **(Row 7, Col 8)**: Empty floor (symbol '.')\n- **(Row 8, Col 3)**: Boiling water (symbol '@')\n- **(Row 8, Col 10)**: Lock (symbol '$')\n- **(Row 9, Col 7)**: Raw pasta (symbol '%')\n\n### Analysis:\n1. The key at (7, 5) is critical for unlocking the lock at (8, 10), ensuring further progress in the game.\n2. The chef cannot move through walls (7, 6) and should look to collect items or move toward interactions that support the overarching strategy of forming a successful dish through optimal combinations.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nThe logical next step is to collect the key located at (7, 5) to unlock further possibilities in the game. To do this, the avatar must first move left to (7, 6).\n\nSince the wall is directly adjacent to the left of the avatar, the avatar would first need to change direction before moving left. This requires two actions:\n\n1. Rotate to face left.\n2. Move to the left to collect the key.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action rotates the avatar left, allowing for the next action to be a successful collection of the key on the subsequent turn. This aligns with the strategy of collecting necessary items early to facilitate further actions."

The boiling water (b) occupies several positions, while the lock ($) is at (row=8, col=10). There's also the raw pasta (%) at (row=9, col=7), which I'm cautious about due to the potential for a \"wrongplace\" outcome if combined improperly.\n\nEvaluating my position at (7, 7), my first action should be to collect the key directly, as it's within my range and critical to unlocking other game features. I will move LEFT to (7, 6), but based on the mechanics, it appears I must rotate first since there\u2019s a wall (as per the sprite mapping). \n\nThus, I will perform the action to move LEFT again to attempt to collect the key:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should ideally succeed in getting me closer to the key, and it's a strategic maneuver since collecting the key unlocks additional resources and prevents loss conditions related to the lock."
