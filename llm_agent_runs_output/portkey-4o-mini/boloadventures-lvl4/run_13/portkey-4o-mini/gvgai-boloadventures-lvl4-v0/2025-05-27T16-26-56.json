Notably, there are also positions with holes (`$`) that may affect movement.\n\n### Nearby Exploration:\n1. **Boulders** (`@`): Located in various places on the map that could potentially be used to block threats or create a path.\n2. **Goal** (`#`): Located directly north of the avatar's current position.\n3. **Other Obstacles**: We must navigate through possible threats without encountering boulders or lasers.\n\n### Movement Strategy:\n- To reach the goal at (8, 11), the avatar will need to move upward from its current position.\n- The avatar can only move upwards when it can safely navigate the path without being harmed by any obstacles or threats.\n\n### Analyzing Actions:\nWe can take the following steps based on the current position of the avatar:\n- Check the next cell (13, 11): This cell is unoccupied (`.`), so it\u2019s safe to step there.\n- The next upward cell (12, 11): This cell is also unoccupied (`.`).\n- The next cell again (11, 11): This cell is still unoccupied (`.`).\n- Continuing further (10, 11): This cell, however, is a hole (`$`), but moving to (9, 11) would again be unoccupied (`$`). Finally, (8, 11) is the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the best move strategy involves moving straight up to allow us to eventually negotiate around the obstacles to reach the goal.\n\n**Executing the Action**: \nThe avatar should move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is expected to bring the avatar one step closer to the goal without encountering any immediate threats."

Based on the overall layout, moving towards the goal at (8, 11) requires a rightward or upward navigation strategy.\n\nSince the next desired destination is potentially above, I will attempt to move **up** to (10, 8) for a strategic position, to look for future clear pathways without moving into dangerous areas with boulders.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action is expected to help me reassess the surrounding area from a higher elevation as I continue to navigate towards the goal safely."
