The objective is to navigate through the level while avoiding hazards and reaching the goal located at (8, 11). At the moment, you are surrounded primarily by walls and other ground.\n\n**Analyzing the Situation:**\n1. Surrounding the avatar at (5, 11):\n   - Directly above (4, 11) is a wall (`%`).\n   - Directly below (6, 11) is an empty space and also has a hazard below it (`$` at (6, 10)).\n   - To the left (5, 10) and right (5, 12) are both empty spaces.\n   \n2. The immediate vertical movement to (4, 11) is blocked by the wall. The best course of action would be to move to an adjacent position that will allow for further movement towards the goal.\n\n### Upcoming Steps:\nThe right (5, 12) is a ground space, while left (5, 10) is also an empty space but doesn't lead towards the goal. Moving right would allow for better future navigation towards the goal at (8, 11).\n\n### Action Decision:\nTherefore, the action to take is:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis step is aimed at moving your avatar right, allowing further strategic moves toward the goal. I expect this aligns with the plan of progressing toward the goal while assessing future options based on the evolving layout."

Moreover, since standing still would not yield progress or beneficial alterations to the environmental state, an active approach should be taken.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince your avatar is currently facing right and there's an unobstructed path, moving to the right to column 8 seems like the most viable option.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n  \nThis action will strategically position your avatar closer to the goal, with expectations to either continue to navigate right towards row 8, column 11.
