Moving down seems to open up further options.\n\nTherefore, I choose to take the action down for a potential escape from the immediate wall blockage and further strategize how to navigate toward the goal afterwards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down appears to be the safest option, allowing further exploration of the environment without immediate hazards or obstacles."
