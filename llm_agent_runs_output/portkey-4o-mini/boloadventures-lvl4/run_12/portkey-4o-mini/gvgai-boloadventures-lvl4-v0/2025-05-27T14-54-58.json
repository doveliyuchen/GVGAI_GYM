This offers a potential safe area.\n   \n2. **Movement Opportunities:**\n   - The avatar can move left (to column 12), right (to column 14), up (to row 5), or down (to row 7). However, moving right (to column 14) leads to a wall or obstacle based on the layout.\n\n3. **Strategic Movement:**\n   - Moving left to column 12 places the avatar still near obstacles but avoids moving into a potentially dead-end right movement.\n   - Moving down to row 7 is currently an open path.\n   - The ultimate goal (row 8, column 11) is two rows down and will require careful navigation to reach it without succumbing to any hidden hazards.\n\n### Action Choice\nGiven the surrounding obstacles and positioning that does not change, I should now act to move down to maximize the potential for safely avoiding obstacles while getting closer to the goal:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down should provide a pathway towards the goal while also keeping the avatar away from potential hazards."

Therefore, the current strategy should focus on moving left or right, avoiding hazardous tiles.\n\nConsidering the constraints, the best immediate action is to move **RIGHT** to (11, 13) since it moves the avatar away from the hole and towards an unoccupied tile. This adheres to the strategy of avoiding obstacles and directly approaches a potential goal without facing immediate dangers.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis move to the right should place the avatar in a safe tile, allowing further exploration or ensuring safe access to subsequent actions."

Moving in these directions may result in an impasse or lead to a situation where the space is too restricted.\n2. **Available Moves:** \n   - **Left (to 13, 9)** is not advisable due to the boulder.\n   - **Up (to 12, 10)** is blocked by a boulder.\n   - **Right (to 13, 11)** presents a safe option since it's clear.\n   - **Down (to 14, 10)** is also safe since it's empty.\n3. **Goal Orientation:** The goal is located at (8, 11), which indicates we may want to prioritize movements that help us progress up the rows, particularly towards row 8.\n\nGiven this analysis, my best immediate move is to the right (13, 11), as it keeps options open and avoids immediate threats.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to an open space, allowing for further exploration towards the goal while avoiding blocking boulders.
