Because your objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards, you need to plan your movement carefully.\n\nGiven the current map layout, here are potential movements:\n- Moving **up** (which would be toward (row=5, col=13)) would keep you in place since there are only walls blocking further upward movement afterward.\n- Moving **down** would take you towards the holes which could cause you to lose points if something unfavorable happens.\n- Moving **left** or **right** does not get you closer to the goal.\n\nGiven this assessment, the best action would be to **move right to (row=6, col=14)**. This maneuver opens options for either continuing down next turn or navigating left and around obstacles.\n\nThus, the decision is:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action positions you to have more routes to take toward your goal while aiming to avoid hazards effectively."

Moving left (to column 6) is blocked by a wall.\n2. Moving right (to column 8) is not blocked and leads to an open ground.\n3. Moving down (to row 10) is also an open ground.\n4. Moving up (to row 8) directly leads to the goal (8, 11).\n\n### Decision\nGiven the strategic importance of reaching the goal as soon as possible, the action that will make the avatar move is to go **up** directly towards the goal. \n\n### Action to Take:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action should lead to the avatar reaching the goal sprite (#) and result in a score increase, in line with our objective. After executing this action, my expectation is to see the avatar's position change to (8, 7), enabling the next move towards the goal at (8, 11)."

However, moving down won't directly lead further away from the goal.\n\nGiven the potential moves:\n1. **Left** to `(11, 11)` keeps the avatar on the same row, maintaining proximity to the goal in later moves, allowing a potential upward move in the following turn if opened.\n2. **Right** to `(11, 13)` doesn\u2019t offer immediate advantage since it moves away from the goal path.\n3. **Down** could potentially open up more paths but doesn't directly progress toward the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nMoving **left** to `(11, 11)` is a strategic move since it prepares us to make an upward move in the next turn towards the goal, should any openings arise. \n\n### Action\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to `(11, 11)` will keep the strategy aligned with approaching the goal on future turns."
