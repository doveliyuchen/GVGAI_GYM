There are wall sprites ('%') surrounding the play area, and the pathway is primarily open with holes ('$') and boulders ('@') present.\n\nGiven the existing strategy and the avatar's current position, I'll consider the available directions for movement. The closest potential moves without hitting walls are:\n\n- **Left (column 13)**: This is a free space (.). \n- **Right (column 15)**: This is also a free space (.).\n- **Up (row 14)**: This is also a free space (.).\n- **Down (row 16)**: This is a wall (%), so moving down is not possible.\n\nSince the last action was checked (potentially moving up, left, or right), I will make a movement towards one of the free spaces. Given that both left and right are valid moves, moving to the left seems strategic since it can help reposition me away from the wall blockade on the lower rows while keeping options open. \n\nI'll proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is moving left, which I anticipate will provide an additional move while keeping safe from potential hazards in the next turn."

Following the upward path along the column could help navigate toward (row 8, col 11).\n\n### Recommended Action\nWe'll take the action **upwards** since it is a safe move and leads towards the general direction of the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should help navigate closer to the goal while avoiding any immediate hazards."
