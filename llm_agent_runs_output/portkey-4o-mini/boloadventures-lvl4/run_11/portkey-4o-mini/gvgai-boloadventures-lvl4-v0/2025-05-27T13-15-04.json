This action will not successfully move us, as the hole means the avatar cannot land there.\n\n### Further Analysis\nIf moving down does not work, my next best option would be to try moving left or right to see if either direction provides a more favorable path towards the goal.\n\nHowever, considering the details of the map, moving left (to (6, 8)) or right (to (6, 10)) will not lead us closer to the goal either at this moment since row 6 is comparatively clear.\n\nThus, I will proceed to try moving right first.\n\n### Executing Action\n```Action: 2```\nI expect to see if this will allow movement while keeping strategic awareness of nearby boulders and potential new paths that may emerge based on the new position of the avatar."
