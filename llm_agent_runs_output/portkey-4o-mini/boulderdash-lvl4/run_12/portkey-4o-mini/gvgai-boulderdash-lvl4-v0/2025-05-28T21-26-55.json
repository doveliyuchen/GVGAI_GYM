Moving up (action `ACTION_UP` to (9, 12)) also doesn't move towards valuable items or the exit.\n3. Movement right (action `ACTION_RIGHT` to (10, 13)) moves towards wall or (10, 14) no advantage there too.\n4. Moving down (action `ACTION_DOWN` to (11, 12)) takes into a clear area but no immediate gains.\n\nNext best option is to collect the nearest diamond at four directions (decision on the diamond) ensuring to navigate the inner walls and two adjacent rows have limited movement toward crab and butterfly making it a risk. \n\nChoosing to go back up can avoid combat until checking the further pathways.\n\nThus, I'll act by moving:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action attempts to move the avatar down (11, 12) towards a clearer space while planning for upcoming moves against enemies or navigation around to secure diamond."

Given that the current position is surrounded by two empty spaces (up and down), and engaging the enemy is not beneficial, the best option is to move to an empty square.\n\n### Selected Action\nI will move **down** to (11, 16) to avoid the butterfly and explore further without risking loss of score or life.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to keep the avatar safe while maintaining progress, aligning with resource management strategies."

Based on the game rules, I need to collect fewer than 10 diamonds and reach the exit door located at (10, 6). The current diamond count from the map indicates the following:\n\n- The diamonds ('%') are located at:\n  - (1, 1)\n  - (1, 18)\n  - (4, 7)\n  - (4, 16)\n  - (4, 18)\n  - (5, 24)\n  - (6, 7)\n  - (6, 24)\n  - (7, 19)\n  - (11, 20)\n\nThere are many diamonds available; thus, I must avoid picking up too many. My current diamond count is either zero or very few, allowing me substantial freedom in deciding my movements towards the exit.\n\nFrom the current position (10, 16):\n- Moving left (to (10, 15)) would take me away from the diamonds and toward the dirts ('-'), but it's directly toward the exit.\n- The exit is located at (10, 6) and moving left is the most straightforward approach toward it, though there may be need for diamond collection to acquire a total of fewer than 10 while moving left.\n\nTo optimize my movement and strategy without increasing my diamond count unnecessarily:\n1. I'll move left directly toward the exit while not collecting any more diamonds I don't need.\n\nThus, the action to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving left seems to align with the goal of reaching the exit effectively while keeping a focus on my diamond collection strategy. The expectation is that I'll find strategic movements toward the exit with minimal risk of encountering enemies."
