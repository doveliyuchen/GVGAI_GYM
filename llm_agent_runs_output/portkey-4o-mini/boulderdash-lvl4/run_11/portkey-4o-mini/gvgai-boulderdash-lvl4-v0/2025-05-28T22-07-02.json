Your immediate surroundings are dirt (represented by '.'), empty spaces '&', and moving against boulders '@'. \n\n### Analysis\n- The avatar is positioned on an empty tile (dirt).\n- The tiles immediately accessible from your position (10, 6) are:\n    - Up (9, 6): '&' (empty)\n    - Down (11, 6): '.' (empty)\n    - Left (10, 5): '&' (empty)\n    - Right (10, 7): '.' (empty)\n\nNone of the nearby tiles are directly containing a resource or enemy, but the conditions of the game's rules concerning movement and the strategic collection of resources are still valid.\n\n### Decision Making\nBased on the strategic suggestions:\n1. **Plan Exit Route**: While you're at a relatively safe position, determining where to move next is critical.\n2. **Resource Management**: If possible, you should aim to collect diamonds ('%'). The closest diamond is at (4, 7) which is quite far.\n3. **Navigate Carefully**: Move upward to gather more knowledge about your surroundings or shifting left/right to get a better position.\n  \nHowever, currently, collecting diamonds isn't feasible given their position. Thus, exploring slightly may serve better.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven these options and the need for exploration without immediate threats, I will move **Up**.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action positions your avatar to (9, 6) and allows you to scout the upper tiles for potential resources or new paths. This aligns with the strategy of careful navigation and planning for future actions."

There are no enemies or other resource sprites in the immediate vicinity.\n\n### Action Considerations:\nGiven that there are many spaces to explore and no immediate threats, my next action should aim to collect resources (specifically diamonds) or clear a path for future movements. The nearest potential target visible in the map is diamonds, which I need to track efficiently to maintain a count below 9 for future exit conditions.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move **Down** to (11, 6) on the grid, which is the next row directly under my current position. This way, I can continue to explore without any immediate danger while checking for more diamonds.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving down allows me the opportunity to access new spaces and assess what's available for me in future turns while heading towards areas with potential resources.
