Since the avatar is positioned to the right of the exit door, the most logical initial action is to move left (`ACTION_LEFT`) to navigate toward the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy to move directly towards the exit, while also creating opportunities to manage enemy interactions carefully along the way.

Diamonds are located (1, 1), (1, 18), (4, 7), (4, 16), (4, 18), (5, 24), (6, 7), (6, 24), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 14), (8, 15), (11, 20), and (11, 24).\n3. **Boulder Mechanics**: You have boulders nearby that could be used strategically.\n4. **Enemies**: Be mindful of not getting pushed back or caught by enemies; attacking should be done with caution.\n\n### Next Action\nTo ensure movement towards the exit while considering the risks, the safest action is to move left to (10, 11) for planning the next steps.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis move towards the exit door allows me to reassess the situation for my next turn without immediate risk of enemies.

Moving left (to (10, 12)) is straightforward.\n2. A quick look at the immediate vicinity shows that the direct path to the exit (moving left) is blocked by walls ('b') immediately at (10, 12), (10, 11), and further towards (10, 6). \n3. Therefore, the avatar needs to move up, down, or potentially use resources first.\n\n### Strategy Recap:\n- **Resource Collection**: Ensure to collect diamonds but remain under 9.\n- **Avoid Enemies**: There are no enemies immediately nearby that will impede movement.\n- **Plan Moves**: Since the avatar cannot immediately move to the exit due to walls, I need to either go down through the more accessible route or left onto unblocked cells.\n\nGiven that only downward movement from (10, 13) to (11, 13) provides a path to clear after that blockage, that direction appears strategically sound.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis move should facilitate unlocking a pathway toward the exit while ensuring that the avatar does not come too close to potential enemy sprites or walls.

In order to reach the exit, the avatar must have fewer than 9 diamonds.\n\n### Current Analysis:\n1. **Diamond Count**: The avatar appears to be at a critical spot where they have to manage their diamond count effectively. Under the visible map, there is one diamond located above at (row 11, col 20), and the avatar might be interested in collecting it. However, if the approach to the exit causes the total to exceed 9, then collecting further diamonds would be detrimental.\n\n2. **Movable Objects**: There are boulders ('@') and a lot of background walls ('b') and obstacles around, which implies that careful movement around these structures is necessary to avoid being crushed or blocked.\n\n3. **Avoiding Enemies**: The avatars should avoid enemies, which can push them back if they come in contact. The closest enemies are the butterfly ('#') and crab ('$'), both of which might pose a threat depending on the movement direction.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe strategy suggests planning a move to either collect a diamond or head toward the exit in a safe manner. Since the avatar position has not changed from the last state, it's crucial to move.\n\nTo maximize winning chances while adhering to the rules and ensuring that when I move towards the exit, I need to keep below 9 diamonds.

There are also boulders (`@`) that can be moved strategically, and it\u2019s important to avoid getting crushed by them.\n\n### Current Layout Analysis\nThe path from the avatar's current position (10, 13) to the exit door (10, 6) is as follows:\n- The avatar needs to move left through the positions: (10, 12), (10, 11), (10, 10), and (10, 9) to reach (10, 6).\n- (10, 12) has `@` (boulder), (10, 11) is empty, (10, 10) has `@` (boulder), and (10, 9) has `@` (boulder) until reaching the exit.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven the objective of collecting a manageable number of diamonds while safely moving toward the exit door, the best action after the current position is to first **move left** potentially to either consider a future action (like interacting with boulders) or assess the situation further after that.\n\nThus, the decision is:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action of moving left should allow the avatar to progress toward the exit while keeping an eye on the diamond count and enemy locations."

The main goal is to collect diamonds while ensuring that the count is under 9 when reaching the exit.\n2. We are currently at (9, 15) with the immediate area allowing for movement: \n   - Up (to row 8) is free.\n   - Down (to row 10) goes towards the exit but needs careful navigation through enemies.\n   - Left (to column 14) is a free dirt space.\n   - Right (to column 16) has a boulder, which could be manipulated but blocks access to the exit directly.\n\nGiven the enemy presence at (10, 17) and the near exit, direct movement downward to the exit row (10) seems risky without clear clearing of enemies or boulders.\n\n### Recommended Action\nTo avoid engaging or getting pinned by the enemies while allowing space for later potential actions, the best immediate action is to **move left (to 9, 14)**.

Moving up (to (9, 15)) also results in free space ('.').\n\nTo avoid immediate threats from the enemies (both crabs '$' and butterflies '#'), and given the necessity to get closer to the exit (which is to the left, at (10, 6)), maneuvering in such a way to avoid confrontation is essential. Avoiding enemies aligns with the strategy of minimizing direct interactions unless beneficial.\n\nGiven these analyses, the best immediate action would be to move **up** (ACTION_UP) since it presents a safe spot at (9, 15) and ensures that the next turn can be planned with caution. \n\nThus, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action should help me navigate safely while assessing future moves towards the exit and prevent unnecessary enemy engagement."

(background), indicating a safe move.\n- To the right (row=10, col=13) is a '.'

The primary goals are resource collection and safe navigation to the exit without taking damage or exceeding the diamond limit of 9.\n2. Staying away from enemies unless attacking is crucial.\n3. Planning moves based on immediate surroundings is vital.\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. **ACTION_NIL (0)**: Do nothing, which won\u2019t change the position.\n2. **ACTION_USE (1)**: Using the sword (though there are no enemies nearby to attack).\n3. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Move left to (row=10, col=11), which is safe.\n4. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Move right to (row=10, col=13), which is also safe.\n5. **ACTION_DOWN (4)**: Move down to (row=11, col=12), but that risks dropping a boulder on the avatar.\n6. **ACTION_UP (5)**: Move up to (row=9, col=12), which also risks injury from another boulder.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe safest move for the avatar is to move either left or right since both directions are clear of immediate threats. To follow the strategy of maximizing safety while ensuring progress, I will choose to move **left**.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis move avoids potential harm and aligns well with the strategy of navigating safely through the environment.
