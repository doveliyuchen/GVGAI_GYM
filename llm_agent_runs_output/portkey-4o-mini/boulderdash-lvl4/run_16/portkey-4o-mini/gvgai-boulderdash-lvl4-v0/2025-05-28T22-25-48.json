Moving left to (7, 6) or up to (6, 7) also keep you safe while nearby diamonds.\n\n### Strategy Choice:\nConsidering that movement is pivotal and resource management is crucial, your immediate option is to move in a direction that not only ensures no misstep into a boulder or enemy but also sets you closer to a diamond source.\n\n**Action: Move Up to (6, 7)**, which contains a diamond.\n\n```Action: 5```\nFeedback: This action will allow you to collect a diamond without risking collision with enemies or boulders, moving you closer to unlocking the exit condition."
