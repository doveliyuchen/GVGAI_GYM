In evaluating the immediate strategy, it\u2019s critical to manage the diamond limit effectively while also avoiding any potential enemies nearby, specifically the butterflies ('#') and crabs ('$') on row 5 and 10.\n\nSince the position hasn't changed, I'll consider potential movements. Moving upwards to (10, 13) will not provide any advantage as the area above is still the same row as enemies. Instead, I need to consider moving left, right, or downward for collecting diamonds while ensuring I don't exceed 9 diamonds.\n\nThe next informative action is to move left to (11, 12) to explore without engaging the enemies directly. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to move towards a safer route and reassess in the next state without touching any enemies or collecting unintended diamonds."

However, collecting too many may cause the count to exceed 9, which will prevent reaching the exit successfully.\n\n2. **Enemy Encounter**: I need to be careful of the enemies in the vicinity, specifically the butterflies surrounding the area.
