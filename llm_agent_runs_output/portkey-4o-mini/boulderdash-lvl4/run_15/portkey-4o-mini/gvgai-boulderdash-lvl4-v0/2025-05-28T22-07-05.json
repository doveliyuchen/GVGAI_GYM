Now, let's analyze your possible next action:\n\n### Options\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Move to (10, 8). This space is clear (dirt).\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Move to (10, 10). This space is also clear (dirt).\n3. **ACTION_UP (5)**: Move to (9, 9). This space is clear (dirt).\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (4)**: Move to (11, 9). This space has a boulder (`@`), which is an obstacle.\n\n### Strategy Alignment\nFrom the overall strategy, we should prioritize movement to areas that may allow you to collect resources (like diamonds) and avoid enemies or hazards.\n\nYou can collect a diamond located (1, 1) or (1, 18) based on the layout, but moving toward them would require navigating through potentially dangerous areas. You can take some time to clear an avenue without being obstructed.\n\nBased on this setup, I recommend moving **UP to (9, 9)** because it's currently a valid and unobstructed option leading to more potential movement. Sticking to the strategy, you can scout your surroundings better while ensuring your safety.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis move is expected to align well with exploring potential paths and identifying diamond locations while remaining cautious of hazards."
