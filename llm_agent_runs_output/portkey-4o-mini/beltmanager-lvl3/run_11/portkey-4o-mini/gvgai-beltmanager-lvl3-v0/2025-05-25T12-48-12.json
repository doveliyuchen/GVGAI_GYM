Considering the context, we assume the player's avatar is near one of the rows with 'p' at the edges.\n  \n2. **Obstacles and Collectibles**:\n   - The map has walls ('p') and is filled with many '@' (belts) which can move the suitcase ('$').\n   - There are '@' suggesting movement paths.\n   - Passengers ('l') are located at (9,3).\n   - 'Death' sprites ('%') are strategically placed and should be avoided.\n\n### Objective Consideration:\nThe goal is to collect passengers using the suitcase while maintaining its safety and avoiding walls or death sprites.\n\n### Strategy Choice:\n1. Identify the lever positions to manipulate the belts and make way for collecting passengers.\n2. Focus first on safely moving towards (9,3) where the passenger is located while steering clear of death sprites or walls.\n\n### Action Determination:\nThe last known avatar position isn't stated, but to start reaching (9,3), the simplest course is to engage initially with either leveraging the belts or moving towards the available direction intelligently.\n\nGiven that there is a passenger at (9,3) while also ensuring that the suitcase is not placed in jeopardy, I determine the most viable action is to move 'LEFT' towards (9,3) to collect the passenger.\n\n### Deciding Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to head toward the passenger while analyzing the state to ensure the suitcase remains safe on subsequent turns, aligning with our objective of collecting passengers while avoiding risks."

Moreover, the suitcase ('$') is located just to the left of the current avatar position (8, 30), which means I can potentially interact with the belt mechanism or nearby levers for effective movement, considering I need to avoid the death sprite ('%') to the left (in rows 3 and 4).\n\nSince the last mentioned action did not alter the avatar's position, I will choose to take an action of moving right to interact with the belt.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is aimed at moving right onto the belt and possibly engaging with it to either advance towards collecting nearby passengers (like the one at (9, 3)) or manipulate the environment further."
