The goal is located at (row=1, col=9), so it requires careful navigation through the surrounding obstacles such as walls and boxes.\n\n**Current Considerations:**\n\n1. The avatar cannot directly move towards the goal because it's blocked by boxes immediately next to it.\n2. The area is surrounded primarily by empty spaces ('.'), which might require moving boxes to clear a path.\n\n**Next Step based on Strategy:**\n\n1. Since there are multiple movements to make space around the avatar, moving in a way that could either reposition the avatar or interact with its environment is key.\n2. Engaging with the boxes around the avatar should ultimately allow it to create a path to the goal.\n\nGiven these reasons, to check for movement options, I will attempt to move the avatar upwards, towards (row=8, col=10), which is currently a wall ('%'). This might not be a valid move based on the immediate left right actions.\n\nHowever, if we choose to check downwards to (row=10, col=10) job to see whether interaction is possible.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action focuses on exploring the lower cinematic space to verify if any sprite changes occur downwards into spaces comprising boxes, as platforms direct us towards a richer gameplay flow.
