Hence, the first step is likely to eliminate some boxes to enable your movement towards the goal. Adding the bombs into the strategy can help clear this path.\n\n### Decision Making\nYour options are to interact with nearby boxes or navigate away. Since interacting with a box could potentially clear the space ahead or may score points, the most strategic move would be to use a bomb on at least one of the surrounding boxes. This would create a spark and play into the transformation mechanics to access the goal.\n\n### Action Choice\nGiven that the rules and strategies suggest using bombs for manipulation, my chosen action is to:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action represents the use of a bomb on the box immediately adjacent to your avatar.

Since the avatar is currently surrounded by free spaces and boxes, moving in a different manner may create more opportunities to progress towards the goal.\n\n### Last Action Reflective Strategy\nGiven the last action is not provided, but assuming the avatar didn't move, we can attempt a directional move to find a better route.\n\n### Proposed Action\nThe most strategic move would be to go **UP (ACTION_UP)** towards (row 8, col 9), which is free space. This would allow for better navigation towards the goal in subsequent turns.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action should help in repositioning the avatar to explore a path toward the goal.

The available action that allows for interaction without moving into danger would be to discard the box (by using bombs).\n\nThis approach implies using the bomb to obtain sparks or set boxes on fire.

Since there are walls and several boxes hindering direct access, we should consider using `ACTION_USE` to manipulate the environment and potentially create a safe route toward the goal. This is particularly important given the nearby boxes, which could be set on fire to score points too.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the avatar hasn't moved yet in the current position, the best first step is to check for immediate interactions available.

There are also water hazards below the avatar.\n\n3. **Potential Next Moves**: The avatar can move:\n   - Up to (8, 9) which is blocked by a wall '%'.\n   - Down to (10, 9), which is also a wall '%'.\n   - Left to (9, 8) which has a clear path and is a box '@'.\n   - Right to (9, 10), which has a clear path and is also a box '@'.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the avatar cannot move up or down due to walls, it is best to move horizontally. Moving left or right opens the possibility of interacting with boxes\u2014a necessary action to gain points, clear obstacles, or potentially create sparks.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will choose to move left to (9, 8) to interact with the box located there.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action opens up potential interactions with the box and helps in moving toward the goal strategically.

To analyze the current state of the game and potential actions:\n\n1. **Goal Position**: The goal ('#') is located at (1, 9).\n2. **Neighboring Terrain**: The immediate surroundings consist of:\n   - Below (10, 8): wall ('%')\n   - Above (8, 8): wall ('%')\n   - Left (9, 7): clear ground ('.')\n   - Right (9, 9): clear ground ('.')\n\nGiven this layout, the most viable action is to navigate left or right, as upward and downward movements are blocked by walls.\n\nMy previous position was (9, 8) and I did not move. Therefore, I will perform the action of moving left, which should change my position to (9, 7).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left to (9, 7) will help me explore the terrain further and possibly move towards the goal efficiently."
