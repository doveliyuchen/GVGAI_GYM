The avatar needs to navigate upwards to reach the goal while avoiding walls and hazardous water.\n2. The movement needs careful planning as moving into water zones will hurt the avatar.\n3. There are several boxes that can be used strategically to reach pathways or transform other elements if necessary.\n\n### Current Evaluation:\n- The fastest path to the goal is to ascend towards the goal row. \n- The avatar can move up, but before moving, I need to check if there's water or wall directly above (at (row=8, col=10)).\n\n### Map Check for Upward Move:\n- Checking the cell (row=8, col=10) reveals a wall (%), preventing upward movement from (row=9, col=10).\n\nSince I'm unable to move up, the next approach would be to explore other options or items.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- The next logical step is moving to the left (toward (row=9, col=9)) or exploring what can be done with the available boxes and bombs at my position.\n\nGiven the current restrictions, I will try moving left to see if it opens up additional pathways or options for actions.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left might provide access to new potential pathways or items that can assist in reaching the goal while adhering to the strategy of exploring and managing resources effectively."
