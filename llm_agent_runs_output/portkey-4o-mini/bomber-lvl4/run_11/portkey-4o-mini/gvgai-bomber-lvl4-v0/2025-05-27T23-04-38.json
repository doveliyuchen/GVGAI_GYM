The direct path, however, is blocked by a combination of walls and obstacles such as boxes and water.\n2. **Health Management**: The avatar has 10 health points and must navigate carefully to avoid fire or water hazards.

The goal (1, 9) is relatively far away, and there are hazards (such as walls and water) to navigate around.\n2. **Nearby Obstacles**: The column 6 for rows 8 to 10 has walls.

The immediate area around the avatar seems to have no lethal water, but nearby walls may create navigation challenges.\n\n2. **Actions Available**:\n   - Attempting to move up (to (row=8, col=6)) leads into an untraversable wall ('%').\n   - Moving down (row=10) or sideways (left/right to (row=9, col=5) or (row=9, col=7)) should be examined.\n\nSince upward movement is blocked by a wall, and both left and right movements do not seem to lead to an immediate advantage or possible interactions, I will consider moving left to explore other pathways.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action (moving left) is in alignment with the strategy of exploring the area around the avatar while avoiding health loss and eventual navigation towards the goal."
