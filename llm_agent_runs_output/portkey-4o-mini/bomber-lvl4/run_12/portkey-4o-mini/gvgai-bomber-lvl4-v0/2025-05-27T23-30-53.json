My avatar, represented by 'a', is located at coordinates (9, 10).\n\n### Current Position Analysis:\n- The immediate surroundings:\n  - To the left (9, 9): `@` (box)\n  - To the right (9, 11): `@` (box)\n  - Above (8, 10): `%` (wall)\n  - Below (10, 10): `%` (wall)\n\nSince both the left and right positions contain boxes (`@`), I have the option to move in either direction. \n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Moving left to (9, 9) where there is a box.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Moving right to (9, 11) where there is also a box.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to navigate through the level while avoiding hazards and reaching the goal. Since both adjacent positions contain boxes, I need to strategically choose where to move to either clear some space or interact favorably later.\n\nBy moving left to (9, 9), I will be adjacent to another box but can plan to use it to create a pathway or strategize my next move effectively. Therefore, I will move left.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action will reposition my avatar and allow me to continue evaluating my options for further moves. I expect to be closer to manipulating the boxes toward a pathway leading to the goal."

Based on the map:\n\n- The avatar is surrounded by multiple '@' boxes, and these can be interacted with. \n- The direct path to the goal at (1, 9) likely requires some strategic movement due to potential obstacles like walls and water.\n- Given the rules and priorities, the avatar should focus on moving towards the goal while not getting harmed by any hazards.\n\nConsidering the immediate surrounding tiles from the avatar's location:\n- (row 9, col 9): '.' (safe)\n- (row 9, col 11): '@' (can interact/move)\n- (row 8, col 10): '%' (wall, cannot move through)\n  \nThe immediate next step to determine if I should move left (to col 9) or right (to col 11) presents a viable option to either collect or clear a pathway.\n\nGiven my current options of moving left or right, I will attempt to move **left** towards the \".\" at (row 9, col 9) as it makes progress without obstruction or risk.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis move is safe and allows me to better assess the situation ahead while continuing towards the goal and utilizing direct pathways unaffected by hazards."
