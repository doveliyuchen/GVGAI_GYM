Based on the rules:\n- You need to avoid allowing broken eggs to appear by efficiently managing your resources.\n- Since you need resources, moving toward the eggs would help in resource gathering.\n\n### Action Selection\nI will choose to move downwards to collect these eggs. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action allows me to move towards the eggs, gathering resources, which is crucial for dealing with the chickens later in the game and aligns with the strategy of resource management."
