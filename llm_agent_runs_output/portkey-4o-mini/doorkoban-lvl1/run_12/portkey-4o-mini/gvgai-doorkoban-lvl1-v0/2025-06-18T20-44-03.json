Moving down to (10, 1) also brings us to a clear space.\n\nHowever, moving up to (8, 1) could lead to potential further actions to move the box. Based on our strategic priority of analyzing the state and considering the location of entities:\n\nMoving up could facilitate moving the box out of the way to eventually create paths to holes, but we'd need to assess where we can place that box afterward.\n\nFor now, I will choose to go **right**, which preserves our current options and positions us favorably within the layout, leading us to potentially explore further actions with adjacent spaces.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nBy moving right, I expect to keep my options open while moving towards the clear spaces that could lead to successful box placements or transitions."

Boxes need to be moved into holes to potentially score points.\n2. There are holes at (9, 5) (hole0), (11, 11) (hole3), and (11, 12) (hole2).\n3. The exit is located at (5, 8).\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the setup:\n1. Since the exit is significantly higher up, we will need to strategize on how to interact with the boxes and holes effectively to reach it by not getting stuck or wasting time.\n2. The nearest boxes are currently positioned at (8, 1) and (11, 11).\n3. The immediate action should focus on either moving towards a box to engage with it or getting closer to a hole to drop a box in.\n\n### Decision Making:\nMy first move should be to proceed up to engage with the boxes and explore further opportunities to clear the holes. Moving left would take me toward a floor, while moving up brings me closer to strategic area. \n\n### Execution:\nThus, I will move **up** from (10, 3) to (9, 3).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will check potential interactions above and help move towards a position with more options towards reaching an exit.

To proceed, I\u2019ll first need to analyze if a box can be moved successfully towards a hole or if I can advance towards the exit.\n\n### Action Decision:\nMy avatar is currently surrounded by empty tiles, suggestive of the opportunity to move either left, right, or up. Since there are walls on both sides (to the left and right) and the exit is more accessible by moving upwards potentially to interact with holes.\n\nMoving up seems the most logical first action to evaluate adjacent spaces next.
