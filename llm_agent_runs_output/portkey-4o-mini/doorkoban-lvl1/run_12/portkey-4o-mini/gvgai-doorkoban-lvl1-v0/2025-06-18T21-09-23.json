The objective is to navigate through the level and reach the exit at position (5, 8) while maximizing your score from interacting with the boxes and holes.\n\n### Evaluation of Current Position and Environment\n- The avatar is surrounded by walls (w) on the left (column 4) and below (row 11) but there's an open (.) space to the right and above.\n- Directly adjacent spots are at (10, 4) (w), (10, 6) (w), (9, 5) (h), (11, 5) (.) where 'h' denotes a hole which can be interacted with for scoring.\n\n### Strategy Review\nSince your current position does not change after a potential action (meaning you've either rotated or done nothing), you need to apply a new action to make progress towards the exit. The strategic recommendation includes moving upwards where there is a potential hole at (9, 5) for scoring, which can help in your objective to accumulate points.\n\n### Proposed Action\nTo proceed, I will:\n1. Move Up to position (9, 5) where there's a hole which I can interact with, setting me on the path toward the exit.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to help me interact with the hole for scoring and to continue navigating towards the exit efficiently."

However, holes typically require a box to score with on them.\n2. **Plan Movements**: Given the available actions, I can move down to (11, 5) or left/right, but since moving down does not bring me closer to scoring (as it is an empty space), I need to assess pushing a box instead.\n\nLooking further down to (11, 6) or any other direction to find boxes that could be moved onto holes might be key. However, from the current position, my only meaningful action is going down to change state since the area around doesn\u2019t show an immediate scoring opportunity.\n\nThus, I will choose to go **down** (to (11, 5)) since it allows for potential movement in the next turns towards possible box interactions or hole interactions in upcoming turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows movement into a new space, potentially leading towards scoring opportunities in further steps."

However, it is also important to note that if the avatar is unable to move due to walls ('w'), which surround the playable area, a rotation might happen instead.\n\nGiven that the avatar is currently at (8,5):\n- Going **left** to (8,4) is a floor tile (.), so it's a valid move.\n- Going **right** to (8,6) is a wall (w), so it's an invalid move.\n- Going **up** to (7,5) is a wall (w), so it's an invalid move.\n- Going **down** to (9,5) is a hole (h), which might allow for a scoring opportunity.\n\nSince my primary objective is to maximize the score while moving towards the exit, I'll choose to move **down** into the hole at (9,5). This will give me a chance to interact with the scoring mechanism, possibly score points, or reposition myself effectively. \n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis seems to align with the strategic aspect of utilizing what is available on the board while moving towards favorable interactions as I progress towards the exit."

Additionally, based on previous strategies, maximizing score before reaching the exit is key.\n\n### Making the Move:\n- I choose **ACTION_UP** which will move the avatar to (row 8, col 5).\n\nExpecting that this move will lead to more options in subsequent actions and advance toward navigating effectively through the game.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect this action to provide further options as it keeps the avatar moving toward the pathways that may lead to the exit."
