We also want to evaluate the opportunity to interact with the nearby hole `'h'` located to the east, but since it's crucial to prioritize movements towards the exit while managing the score, we should focus first on making progress toward the exit.\n3.

Move left `(row=9, col=3)` to an empty space, but it doesn\u2019t approach the exit.\n2. Move right `(row=9, col=5)` to hole `'h'`, potentially allowing for a score.\n3.
