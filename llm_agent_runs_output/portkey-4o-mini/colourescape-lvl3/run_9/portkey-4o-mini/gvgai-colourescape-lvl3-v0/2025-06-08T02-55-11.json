The pathway is complex and requires navigating carefully given the presence of holes and the requirement to deal with different boxes and switches.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Since our current position is far from its target (exit), first, we need to check if any immediate moves can bring us closer, while still taking care not to fall into holes.\n2. The most immediate obstacle in navigating closer is that the avatar is in a located row that is heavily surrounded by holes above.\n\n### Plan of Action:\n1. **Action Down:** Moving down from (9, 15) to (10, 15) does not seem useful as it leads further down where there's more wall and no direct access to the important boxes and switches.\n2. **Action Left:** Moving left (9, 15) to (9, 14) gives access to a box ('g'), but would not be immediately beneficial as it doesn't get us any closer to the exit.\n3. **Action Right:** Moving right (9, 15) to (9, 16) is blocked by a wall.\n4. **Action Up:** Moving up (9, 15) to (8, 15) passes over a 'g' which allows a bounce effect but leads somewhat forward through a lower-path.\n\nSince the immediate goal requires us to ultimately reach columns closer to the exit but we need progression through open space further first, executing a **move left** towards the box would place us closer without trapping us.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis should enable some progress, and hopefully, provide further insight into the proximity of the exit from our next position without immediately compromising our state.

The exit is located at (1, 3).\n2. There are several holes ('*') and switches ('@', '%', 'e', 'c') that could potentially alter the avatar's abilities and position.\n\nAssuming that we need to strategically plan a move towards the exit, the first action should be to identify the closest path to the exit (1, 3) and check around for any switch to utilize or obstacles to avoid.\n\nFrom my analysis of the board:\n\n- Moving left (to (1, 2)) or down (to (2, 3)) would be less effective initially since it might lead to a hole or further away from the exit. \n- The path from (2, 2) to (1, 3) through switches at (2, 2) giving the blue avatar allows movement towards the exit adjacent to index coordinates without any immediate hazards.\n\nHowever, to decide on an action, I will take the first logical move towards the exit by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2) if I assume the position starts from (1, 1) as the last state or an avatar there.\n\nGiven all of this and concluding a valid move, I will execute:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar towards the exit point, and I expect that this aligns with the strategic advice of planning moves towards the exit effectively while avoiding immediate hazards."

Considering where you are currently positioned, moving towards the left or down will not immediately help.\n  \n2. **Utilize Switches Wisely:** There\u2019s a red switch at (1, 10) which you may reach if you can navigate through the boxes or switch directly if possible. \n\n3. **Avoid Hazards:** Staying on your current row poses a risk as there are holes below.\n\nGiven the surrounding obstacles, your next logical action would be to move left in an attempt to navigate around hazards towards solid ground.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis leftward move will help you avoid the current hole situation beneath you and position you better for future turns.
