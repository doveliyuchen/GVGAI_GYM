If the avatar were positioned at (1, 3), it could immediately win by moving to the exit square.\n2.

If the avatar is currently facing towards a switch or box, we need to assess if the action would result in an effective change in position or rotation.\n2. Given that there is an adjacent box (indicated by '#'), leveraging movement will likely involve activating switches or navigating around obstacles while avoiding holes.\n\nSince the immediate input states that the avatar's position did not change in the last action, the logical action would be to first rotate in the right direction (if there\u2019s a box or available switch nearby) and then move toward the box or exit next.\n\n### Chosen Action\nSince the state analysis doesn't indicate a specific position for the avatar, let's select a move towards the right or down to possibly interact with the nearby objects.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nI've selected a right action to move the avatar closer towards the box and perhaps engage with it in the following turns while keeping the exit in perspective."

If no specific avatar position is provided, the aim would be to make a logical step towards the exit.\n\n- If I don't have any obstacles blocking my visibility or path, I will attempt to move to the right since it leads to the exit.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThe expectation is that moving right will either bring me closer to the exit or allow further strategic maneuvers without encountering an immediate obstacle or hole."

Given the exit's proximity at (1, 3), I should aim to traverse towards it safely and effectively.\n\n### Selected Action\nSince there are open paths, I will move to the right, aiming to close in on the exit directly:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should allow me to advance towards the exit while maintaining awareness of potential holes and the bouncing mechanics that could play into my next moves.

Strategies should revolve around the paths leading there without interacting with holes '*' or unnecessary box interactions that take time.\n2. **Transformation Needs**: As the requirements for transformation aren\u2019t clear without the avatar's current state, the understanding of the neighboring fields (walls, holes, and switches) is critical.\n3. **Focus on Direct Movement**: If needing to make lateral movements (left, right, up, down), prioritize a direction that would get closer to the exit based on the surrounding threats.\n\nSince I do not have the avatar position defined or listed, I will tentatively choose to explore right (if the avatar is facing that way), and then reassess based on the result.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nMoving right maintains progress toward the exit and can be followed by observing the outcome for further strategy refinement.
