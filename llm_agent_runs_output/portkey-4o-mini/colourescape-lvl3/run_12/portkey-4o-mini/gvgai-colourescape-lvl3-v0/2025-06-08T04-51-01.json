However, if we assume that the most recent input has positioned the avatar near the bottom rows or amongst the boxes, we can see a strategic position presented in the current mapping.\n\nNext, let's consider the primary strategies to effectively guide the avatar towards the exit considering the game's mechanics:\n- **Navigation towards the exit** is paramount. Currently, the exit is located at `(1, 3)`.\n- We could analyze nearby switches and boxes affecting our potential moves.\n- Since the adjacent squares of the exit contain box (`g`) and floor (`.`), there is a potential need to interact and maneuver with boxes to clear a direct path.\n\n### Decision:\nAssuming the avatar has the ability to move or is already situated next to interactive elements, a reasonable expected action would be towards aligning with one of the relevant directions that could navigate the avatar towards the exit while considering the current obstacles:\n\nIf I perceive that moving right (`ACTION_RIGHT`) towards the exit is viable:\n- The next column `(1, 4)` is clear. \n\nTherefore, I'll perform the action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to optimize progress toward the exit, conceptualizing the working strategy of effective navigation. I expect this aligns well with the overall strategy of moving efficiently towards the exit while avoiding hazards."
