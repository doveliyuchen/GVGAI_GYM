To make a meaningful action, I need to first check if I can determine where the avatar is located.\n\nFrom the map configuration given, if I assume that the avatar is represented by a specific identifier (normalAvatar is denoted by 'b'), there seems to be the following relevant data:\n\n- The exit is located at (1,3) denoted by '$'.\n- There are several sprites including holes ('*'), boxes ('#'), and switches like blueSwitch ('@'), greenSwitch ('%'), and redSwitch ('e').\n  \nNext, I should check around known positions for possible player sprites, especially near potential exits. However, since there is a mix of holes and boxes in the vicinity, I will need to strategize carefully.\n\nGiven that the avatars can transform by interacting with different sprites, I will check what transformations or movements can be achieved next based on my surroundings.\n\n1. There is a blue switch at (2,2).\n2. There are holes nearby (e.g., at (2,3) which I should avoid), along with potential traps.\n\n### Further Analysis and Action\nBecause I cannot see a defined position for the avatar and my last analyzing action might not have changed anything, I won't execute an action yet. Instead, I will analyze the possible positions:\n\n- If I\u2019m near (2,2), I could press the blue switch offering transformations or different abilities.  \n- I need to validate that pressing the switch will not involve any repositioning that risks falling into a hole.\n\nSince the state suggests that I might be in the vicinity of an interactive object, I can imagine a movement toward the switch could yield better possibilities in the next steps.\n\nThus, step one will be to interact with the blueSwitch at (2,2) while also considering my surroundings. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis would represent moving right towards (2,2) to interact with the blueSwitch. My expectation is to engage the switch successfully, and subsequently be able to navigate to strategic positions afterward while avoiding falling into holes."

Given the map:\n\n- **Nearby Objects**:\n  - The avatar is near a **green switch** at (7, 1) and **blue switch** at (2, 2).\n  - There are `g` and `&` (green boxes) which can affect movement if approached correctly.\n\n### Deciding on Action\n1. Considering the objective to reach the exit (1, 3), it makes sense to explore movement options towards potential switches and boxes that could facilitate moving or enable transformation.\n  \n2. The best way forward could be focusing on the blue switch since it's only two rows away (moving upward) and might provide a beneficial transformation.\n\nGiven the state and objective, the most strategic move toward interaction is moving **down** to the green box area (7, 1) next, which offers potential for interactions that can lead to a successful route or additional movement options.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action involves **moving down** to (7, 1) to interact with the green switch, with an expectation that it will lead to either transformation or open up new pathways towards achieving the exit."

If it's still (8, 1) near the green switch, I can interact with it to transform into the 'green avatar' and might gain unique interactions with nearby sprites.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the avatar is not currently displayed but assumed to be in proximity:\n- **Test the interaction with the green switch.** This is critical because transforming could provide beneficial abilities to navigate through the adjacent area safely.\n\nWith this approach in mind, I will perform the action of moving down to reach the green switch:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of exploring and using switches effectively while seeking a way closer to exit.

I could potentially use one of these to transform the avatar type for further movement.\n2. **Avoid Holes**: There are several holes present on the map that lead to penalties, indicated by '*'.\n3. **Use Boxes**: Boxes are positioned at multiple places, and they can help me navigate or create paths as needed.\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge and having not moved yet, I will need to begin by checking my surroundings, specifically moving towards the nearby switch at (2, 2) to begin interactions with the environment.\n\nThus, I will choose to **move up** towards the switch (assumed avatar below the switch).\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to assess the interaction with the switch, possibly set me on a path to transition into a different avatar type, and then I can strategize from there.

However, let's assume the avatar is near the bottom or near the switch on (2, 2); an upward movement to (1, 2) would potentially lead to a useful interaction with a switch.\n\nGiven the strategic plan to analyze and manage transformations effectively, I would choose to attempt moving **up** if close to the switch to activate it.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\n#### Feedback:\nBy selecting to move up, the avatar can reach the switch possibly at (2, 2) and engage with it, allowing for a change in avatar type or action that could integrate well with the overall strategy of solving the puzzle and reaching the exit.

Since I lack knowledge of my current position, a reasonable directional move is to start exploring to the right, as it may yield a path forward or necessary transformations.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action aims to potentially advance closer to the exit and gather information about possible transformation options. My expectation is that moving right will either bring me closer to valuable items or further into the map layout, making it easier to strategize the next move."
