    "content": "Given the current game state, the player's position ('bomberman') is at (3, 5). The goal is located at (3, 1), while there are several walls and enemies present in the vicinity, creating potential challenges and opportunities.\n\nCurrently, the strategy should focus on removing walls between the avatar and the goal while managing the proximity of the enemies: bats (@) at (2, 10), and the scorpion (%) at (1, 2) and (6, 16).\n\n### Proposed Action\n1. To move towards the goal, we need to clear the walls in our way, particularly the wall located at (3, 4).\n\n### Next Action\nI will choose to use the 'ACTION_USE' to place a bomb next to the wall at (3, 4) for future explosion to clear a path. \n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis is a strategic move to create an opening toward the goal while also monitoring enemy movements. Expectations are to successfully destroy the wall, allowing further progress toward the exit."
