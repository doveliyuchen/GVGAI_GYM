Only proceed to move when it provides a clear tactical advantage or directly leads toward the goal.\n3. Given the enemy placements and your location, moving toward the left, down, or up may expose you to enemy attacks, especially since bats and other creatures can move randomly around.\n\n### Next Move:\nBased on your position (4, 5), and considering that moving left or down might lead into more encounters rather than clearing a path, I recommend placing a bomb to clear the obstacle directly at (4, 6) first.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nFeedback: I'll place a bomb to clear the wall 'e' which will help create more pathways and potentially take out any enemies nearby. I'm expecting this to help me progress toward the goal."

Notably, the wall right under the goal at (4, 2) can be destroyed.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nFollowing the overall strategy, I should:\n- Plan my movement and bomb placement to ensure a pathway is cleared toward the goal.\n- Avoid getting too close to the enemies.\n- Create a path by destroying barriers while defeating enemies for additional points.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nGiven that I can use bombs to break the wall at (4, 2), I will place a bomb above the wall to create a pathway toward my goal.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis is a strategic move that should help clear the path to my goal while reducing the risk from the enemies immediately surrounding me.
