Observing coordinates around (3,2):\n   - Left (3,1): Floor (.)\n   - Right (3,3): Box (@)\n   - Up (2,2): Floor (.)\n   - Down (4,2): Box Key (*)\n  \nSince the avatar is currently 'nokey' and right next to a box, we can choose to first move left or up to clear the obstacle towards the key, or we could interact with the box directly. However, the key is directly below the avatar at (4,2) hence, moving down will allow the avatar to reach the key.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best course of action now is to move down to (4,2) to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will result in the avatar moving down to collect the key, which is crucial to transform into \u2018withkey\u2019 and subsequently reach the goal. I expect that this aligns well with our strategy of exploring and collecting."
