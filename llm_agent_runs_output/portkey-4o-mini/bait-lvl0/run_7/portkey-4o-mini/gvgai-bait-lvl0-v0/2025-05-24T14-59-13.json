Moving `RIGHT` would take me to (row=3, col=3), which is a `.` (floor) that does not have the key. Therefore, I need to determine the direction to reach the key potentially located at (row=3, col=2) which is also currently occupied by the avatar.\n\n### Evaluating Movement:\n- **Right (col=3)**: (row=3, col=3) is achievable but is not the key location.\n- **Left (col=1)**: (row=3, col=1) is also empty `.` on the way to the goal but does not yield the key.\n- **Up (row=2)**: (row=2, col=2) is also a `.`.\n- **Down (row=4)**: (row=4, col=2) which has the box `*`, also not the key.\n\nGiven that this approach doesn't produce progress towards collecting the key, I need to attempt a different angle as it seems that reaching the key will require navigating back and employing effective movement toward available sprites. \n\nSince there is a **mushroom** at (row=4, col=3) directly adjacent to the direction towards the goal after moving around obstacles, I'll first choose to move **UP** towards the obstacle to interact potentially towards an adjacent slot opening revealing an alternate path or situation for maneuvering. \n\nWith realization, **the goal seems to encompass a move closer to the key**, below the future necessity.\n\nProceeding with the action now: \n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nExpecting to analyze afterward based on the next state post-action to gauge movement efficacy towards successfully acquiring the key."

The avatar is located at (row 3, col 2).\n\nGiven the layout of the map:\n- The key is located at (row 3, col 2), where the avatar currently is \u2014 so, I can collect the key by moving. \n- The goal is located at (row 1, col 1), so once the key is collected, I can move to the goal.\n\nSince the avatar is already positioned on the key, I should take the action to collect it. However, the directionality isn't needed here because I can just collect it directly by being on the key!\n\nNow, assessing the possible actions:\n- The current state requires me to determine if I can move left, right, down, or up. But since I need to transform from 'nokey' to 'withkey', I don\u2019t need to take any directional action here as interaction happens as soon as I am on the key.\n\nNow, to adjust the avatar by acquiring the key, I can perceive this as my immediate action:\n\nSince there is no directional action via the original input format (0-4) for collecting the key, I will just focus on what my movement leads to.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Move:\nSince the current position of the avatar allows for a transformation, I will take confirmation that in the next strategy implementation:\n``` Action: ACTION_NIL ```\nI am expecting that my avatar state could be transformed to 'withkey', and I can proceed towards the goal next round!"
