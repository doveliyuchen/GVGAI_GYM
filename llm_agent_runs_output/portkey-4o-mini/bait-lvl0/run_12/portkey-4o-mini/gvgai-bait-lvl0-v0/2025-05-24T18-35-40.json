The key (`$`) must be located based on the map, which seems to be nowhere visible based on the current information.\n- **Walls ('&')** and **Open Spaces ('.')**: There are walls surrounding various points and plenty of open spaces for movement.\n\n### Initial Assessment:\n1. The goal is two rows above the avatar, but the avatar currently cannot reach it directly because it is in \"nokey\" mode and the key appears to be required to reach the goal.\n2. The only viable movement options for the avatar right now are `LEFT (ACTION_LEFT)`, `RIGHT (ACTION_RIGHT)`, and `DOWN (ACTION_DOWN)` based on the map layout.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- `LEFT (3, 1)`: This moves the avatar left. However, the position (3, 1) is an open space.\n- `RIGHT (3, 3)`: This moves the avatar right to an open space.\n- `DOWN (4, 2)`: This moves the avatar down to a box. We cannot collect a key right now.\n\n### Choosing an Action:\nSince the key is not present in the immediate vicinity and we know we need the key to proceed towards the goal, the most strategic action is to move left (to 3, 1), which keeps us within a safe area while also preparing for the next move. Since the next state if I move left would allow more exploring areas to either find the key or reposition towards safe spots.\n\n**Chosen Action:** \n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis should help reposition my avatar to have better visibility and room for movement towards likely finding the key or exploring further. My expectation is that this movement should be safe and allow for further strategic positioning without immediate loss."
