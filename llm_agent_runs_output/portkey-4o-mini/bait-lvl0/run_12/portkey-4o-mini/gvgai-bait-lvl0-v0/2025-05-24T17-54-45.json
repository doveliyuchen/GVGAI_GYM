The specified level layout does not give the position of the avatar, but according to the sprite symbols, we need to assume the position to be at a place where it can interact with the objects around it.\n\n### Analysis of the Current Map\n- The goal (`#`) is located at (1, 1).\n- There's a mushroom (`m`) at (3, 3) that must be avoided to prevent negative scoring.\n- A key (`$`) can be found at (4, 2), which is essential for winning.\n- The areas that will make the avatar lose a life (holes) are represented by `0`, but there are none visible based on our current map.\n- The presence of walls (`&`) surrounding the layout suggests limited movement options.\n\n### Optimal Strategy Application\nGiven that there doesn't seem to be any specific current avatar position defined in the state, we\u2019ll assume that the avatar starts in some vicinity where it can potentially reach the goal (`#`) or move towards the key (`$`).\n\nConsidering my awareness of the game\u2019s rules and that my action must critically change the position of my avatar or rotate first:\n1. If I\u2019m aiming for the key, I\u2019d typically move towards it (up to row 4, col 2).\n2. If I am positioned at (3, 3), I need to avoid the mushroom and thus would not go down, which would be (4, 3).\n\n### Implementing Action\nSince I may need to rotate first if moving directly towards a wall or another obstacle, I will choose to rotate towards the key's direction. This action is essential as it allows an assessment of whether I can successfully move towards the key or need to adjust.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis choice is based on my analysis that I need to move right towards the key's accessible position and will provide feedback that aligns with the strategy of prioritizing key collection.

We can move in four possible directions: left (2, 3), right (4, 3), up (2, 3), and down (4, 3).\n2. Moving left or up would result in an empty space, while moving down leads us towards the box located at (4, 3) and then potentially moving towards the key at (4, 2).\n\n### Strategy Based on Current Position:\nSince the avatar is in the 'nokey' state, the foremost objective is to reach the key first. The best action here would be to either move down to approach the box (which may be needed to interact appropriately in future maneuvers) or directly to the key if possible.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect the key and the closer route indicates I should move down from my current position, I will proceed with that action.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down towards the box, positioning it well to interact with the box and proceed towards the key on the following turns as planned."

You need to reach the goal at (1, 1) but you cannot do that directly as you lack the key.\n2. There is a key on the board but it\u2019s not visible because it's currently represented in a different form.\n3.

Your primary goal is to secure the key before you can approach the goal.\n\n### Action Choice\nSince your last action didn't change your position, and your aim is to get the key that allows you to win, I will move left towards (3, 1).

The only adjacent options from the avatar's current location (row 3, col 2) are:\n- Up (row 2, col 2): This is a '.' (floor), which is a valid move but does not lead directly to the goal or the key.\n- Down (row 4, col 2): This is '*' (box key), which could interact with other objects.\n- Left (row 3, col 1): This is also a '.'

(floor), another open route.\n\n### Next Action\nSince the goal is to move toward the key (even though it's not visually represented in our current view), I will take the action that could help progress through the level while exploring options.

Therefore, I would collect the key.\n\n``` Action:0 ```\n\nHowever, since we are required to take an action that results in movement or further interaction, the next logical step after understanding that the state has not changed from the initial position requires us to stand still\u2014hence, collect the key effectively.\n\n### Feedback\nIn this scenario, since \u201cACTION_NIL\u201d doesn't actively change our game state and considering we should be preparing to move towards the door next, we might reassess that we should first actively rotate before making an effective movement toward the goal next as part of our sequence.\n\n### Expectation\nI expect that on executing the action, the avatar collects the key and we enter the \u2018withkey\u2019 state, positioning us favorably to advance toward the goal next turn."

Here, the available action is to move down since the avatar is already positioned above the key.\n\nBased on the analysis of the state and the need to collect the key, I'll perform the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis down action should change the state of the avatar from 'nokey' to 'withkey', enabling us to progress towards the goal in future moves."

I need to collect the key to change from the \"nokey\" state to \"withkey\" state, which is necessary to reach the goal.\n2. There are no holes (0) or obstacles around me that would impede immediate access to the key located directly at the avatar\u2019s position.\n\nGiven that my current position does not change when I identify the key directly beneath me, my most sensible action is to collect the key first.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action suggests moving down (3,2) to pick up the key. My expectation is that once I perform this action, I will transform into \"withkey\" (indicated by 'k'), allowing me to now proceed safely towards the goal afterward."
