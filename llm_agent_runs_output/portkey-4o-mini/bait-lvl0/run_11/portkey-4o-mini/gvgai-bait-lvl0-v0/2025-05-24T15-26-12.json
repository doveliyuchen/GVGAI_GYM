Moving **UP** to (2, 2) would result in the avatar moving to an empty space (no immediate advantage).\n2.

Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 3) also lands the avatar on an empty space.\n\n### Decision Making\nGiven the context of the layout, the most strategic move would be to go **up** to (2, 2) where the avatar can explore the area above and potentially figure out a route towards the goal indirectly. Although this doesn't lead to immediate collection of the key, it's a necessary step to analyze further avenues while keeping away from boxes and potential hazards in future turns.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move should provide more context about the surroundings, and I expect to analyze any new outcomes following this step to continue strategizing towards reaching the key and eventually the goal."
