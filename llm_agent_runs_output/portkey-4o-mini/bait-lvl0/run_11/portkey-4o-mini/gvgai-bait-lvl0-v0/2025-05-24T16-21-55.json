The nearest goal (`#`) is at (1, 1), and there is a key (`$`) located at (3, 2), which the avatar needs to collect to reach the goal.\n\n### Key Points:\n- The avatar is currently standing on a nokey floor and does not have a key, meaning it cannot interact with the goal yet.\n- The key is located directly at the avatar's position; thus, collecting it is the priority.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- The avatar should move to the key directly to change its state from nokey to withkey.\n\nBased on the available actions, since the avatar is already on the key, it should collect the key without moving. However, the game requires us to ensure the avatar's directionality in movement. Given the mechanics of state change and the current position, I should execute an action to collect the key.\n\nSince the key is directly on the avatar's current position (but not indicated specifically in the action set), I will assume that the avatar can collect it simply by proceeding to interact or wait for the next action cycle, whereas movement action can also trigger the collection depending on indirect movement.\n\n### Expected Actions:\n- The only action that can relate to the collection of the key is moving downwards (to activate picking up). \n\nHence, I will take the action of moving down once again as an attempt to keep the strategy intact with the current position for state evaluation.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is intended to ensure the avatar collects the key and transitions into the withkey state, allowing interaction with the goal.

Additionally, we need to avoid any hazardous moves that might result in losing lives.\n\n### Positioning the Avatar\nWithout knowing the exact current position of the avatar, I need to evaluate which positions are safe and lead either towards the key or the goal:\n\n1. **Identify Movement Options**: The avatar could potentially be at (3, 3) as we noted the nokey state, and from there:\n   - Up (to 2, 3) is free ('.').\n   - Down (to 4, 3) leads directly to a box ('@').\n   - Left (to 3, 2) is free ('.').\n   - Right (to 3, 4) hits a wall ('&').\n\n2. **Next Move Choices**:\n   - If the avatar is at (3, 3), moving down to (4, 3) would give access to a box which we could potentially push; however, we need to prioritize reaching the key to transition to a state that allows us to complete the level.\n\n### Planned Action\nGiven the exploration and the opportunity to push the box immediately present before us, the best action would be to move downwards to (4, 3) where the box ('@') is located.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action seems appropriate to move the avatar towards a strategy that opens new pathways while also targeting the key position on the next potential move."

The best course of action is to explore further along the row or column to see if there are potential moves to gather items:\n\nSince moving left (to (3, 2)) will place the avatar on free space '.', this could allow further exploration towards finding a key or interacting with the box.\n\nI will execute:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action aims to move left into (3, 2) to explore potential opportunities or visibility towards achieving my objective while ensuring my avatar remains safe from hazards."
