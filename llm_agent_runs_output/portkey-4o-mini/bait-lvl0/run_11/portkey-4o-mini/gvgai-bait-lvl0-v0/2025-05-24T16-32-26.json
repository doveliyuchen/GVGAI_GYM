Move UP (to reach the key, if the avatar is directly below).\n2. Move LEFT or DOWN as alternatives to avoid collision with walls.\n\nSince the `#` goal requires a transformation by acquiring a key and moving towards its position, a strategic action could be to navigate towards the key initially.\n\nIf the avatar is at or near (3, 3) or (3, 2), I will proceed with UP to potentially move towards row 2 or row 3 depending on the orientation:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis upward action is selected because it aims to capitalize on moving towards the key and positioning for easier goal access afterward.
