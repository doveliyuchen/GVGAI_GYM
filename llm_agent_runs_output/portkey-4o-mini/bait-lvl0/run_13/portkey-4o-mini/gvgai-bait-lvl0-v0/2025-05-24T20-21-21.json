Use **ACTION_UP (4)**: Move to (1,2) - an empty tile.\n2.

The obstacles include walls (`&`), holes (`0`), boxes (`@`), and mushrooms (`m`).\n\nThe primary objective is to collect the key before heading to the goal, while avoiding hazards. The avatar is currently in the 'nokey' state, meaning it has not collected the key yet.\n\n### Analysis of Actions:\nTo collect the key at position (4, 2), the avatar needs to move downward as it is currently above the key. The possible actions to consider from the avatar's position (3, 1) are:\n\n- **ACTION_DOWN (4)**: Move down to (4, 1), which leads to an empty space (`.`) \n- **ACTION_UP (3)**: Move up to (2, 1), which leads to another empty space (`.`)\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Move left to (3, 0), which is a wall and not allowed.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move right to (3, 2), which is an empty space (`.`)\n\nSince the key is directly below at (4, 2), the best first move is to go down to (4, 1). However, at (4, 1) the avatar can only move further down to (5, 1) where there is a wall. To ultimately reach the key, the avatar needs to move back up after this downward move.\n\n### Deciding the Action:\nGiven that the avatar can move downward, I will execute the action to move to (4, 1), setting myself closer to the key.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should facilitate moving closer to the key, as it aligns with the strategy of collecting the key to advance in the level."
