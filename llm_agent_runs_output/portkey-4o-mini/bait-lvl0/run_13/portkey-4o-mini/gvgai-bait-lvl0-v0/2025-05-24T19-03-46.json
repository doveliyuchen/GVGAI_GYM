The objective is to reach the goal (`#`) located at row 1, column 1. \n\n### Current Condition Analysis:\n1. **Avatar's Position**: The avatar is at (3,1) and needs to reach (1,1).\n2. **Immediate Obstacles**: The path directly upwards from the avatar to the goal is blocked at (2,1) by walls (`&`).\n3. **Key Availability**: The only key available is at (3,1), which is currently where the avatar is.\n4. **Goal's Position**: The goal directly above is located at (1,1).\n\n### Strategic Approach:\nBased on the analysis, the first priority is to obtain the key, which will allow the avatar to interact with the goal later. The only possible action to collect the key is to move into its position; however, the avatar already has it since it is currently at (3,1), the spot representing `$`. \n\nThus, we will next examine other potential moves. \n\n### Available Actions after Obtaining Key:\n1. Move left (but that will lead to a wall `&`).\n2. Move right to (3, 2), where there's a floor (`.`).\n3. Move down (but there's no available space as bottom is sealed by walls).\n4. Move up to (2, 1), but there's also a wall.\n\nSince left and up lead to walls, and down is blocked as well, the only valid action is to move right, which provides a clear floor space.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThe avatar will move right to (3, 2), allowing it to explore and set up for future moves toward the goal while staying away from walls and hazards. This aligns with the strategy of careful navigation and avoiding traps."

The path needs to be planned keeping in mind that the avatar has to collect the key before proceeding to the goal.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the avatar is in position (2, 2) and needs to move to (4, 2) but first must step down towards (3, 2) to avoid walls and possibly collect the key in a future move, I will choose to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down to (3, 2) will bring me closer to collecting the key at (4, 2) and will allow further planning towards reaching the goal.

Since the avatar can either move toward empty spaces or interact with boxes, let's decide on an immediate action.\n\nGiven that the possible directions involve either moving up to (2, 2) which is empty, moving left to (3, 1) which is also empty, or moving down which would not be advancing towards the goal (but gets us close to the box), we should prioritize movement towards the goal.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nI will choose to move **UP (to position 2, 2)**.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up to an empty floor position seems strategic as it allows further movements without immediately encountering walls or traps, advancing towards the goal while maintaining options for future moves."

The avatar also needs to interact with any obstacles while avoiding hazards like holes or mushrooms.\n\n### Possible Actions\n- The avatar needs to navigate efficiently toward the goal while managing transformations when the key is found.\n- Movement appears to be heavily restricted by walls and the positioning of the goal and box key. Since the avatar is currently stationary at (2, 2), I need to rotate or move strategically without immediate danger.\n\nGiven the analysis and after considering all possible moves, I see that the most reasonable action is to move **LEFT** towards (2, 1), where the environment does not currently present any immediate obstacles, and there is a potential path to get to the box key later.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis will position the avatar closer to the edge of the map, potentially creating pathways that allow for the next moves toward the key and eventual goal.

The key is directly below the avatar at (4, 2). \n\nGiven these observations, my next action will be to move **down** to (4, 2) to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is to successfully move to the position of the key and subsequently be able to transform my avatar to access the goal."

    "content": "To interpret the current state of the game, our avatar ('%') is located at position (3, 2). The goal ('#') is located at (1, 1), and the key ('$') needed to unlock the goal is at (4, 2). \n\n### Current State Summary:\n- Avatar Position: (3, 2)\n- Key Position: (4, 2)\n- Goal Position: (1, 1)\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. We can move **DOWN** to (4, 2), which is where the key is located. \n2. We can also consider other movements (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), but they do not lead closer to the key or facilitate reaching the goal as efficiently.\n\nGiven the strategy of prioritizing key collection and ensuring we safely navigate to avoid traps, the best immediate action is to move down to collect the key.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: This action will move the avatar down to collect the key, setting us up to reach the goal in subsequent moves. I expect to see the avatar now with the key, which is crucial for progressing towards the goal."
