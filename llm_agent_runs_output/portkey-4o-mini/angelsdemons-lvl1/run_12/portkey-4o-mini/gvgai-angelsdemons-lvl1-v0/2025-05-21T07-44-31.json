Engaging these will help in converting them to blessed if they get close to the salvation sprites.\n\n2. **Avoid Threats**: We need to be cautious of the bolts near the avatar's area, particularly (11, 6) and (10, 6).\n\nGiven the current situation, moving **downward (11, 12)** does not result in an avoidance of threats, and may be blocked effectively. Hence, **moving to the left (12, 11)** would align better since more potential conversions could be achieved from that point while also avoiding immediate threats.\n\n### Decision\nTherefore, I will take the action to move left from (12,12).\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action aligns with our strategy to engage more citizens towards salvation while enhancing our control of the dynamic state of threats nearby.
