The output (`*`) is located at (12, 31), making it crucial to deploy some citizens effectively while maintaining control over the sprite appearance.\n2. **User Interaction:** The citizen at (12, 2), in particular, is an immediate opportunity for transformation based on the surrounding outputs and angels. Maximizing the use of these transformations can help achieve our goal of balancing sprites.\n\n### Next Action Decision\nGiven the current location of the avatar and the surrounding entities, a strategic move that doesn't change the avatar\u2019s position (as per the game mechanics) should involve interaction with the nearby sprites, leveraging the transformations possible.\n\nSince my avatar's position is going to be essential for strategic movement in the next turns, I should consider moving into a position where I can activate a nearby citizen.

There are several citizens (`%`) nearby, which can potentially be transformed based on interactions.\n\nTo implement the suggested strategies:\n1. **Resource Management:** I need to ensure that I create and transform citizens into blessed sprites, avoiding cursed transformations.\n2. **Timing and Positioning:** My current goal should involve planning an effective movement, possibly to interact with a nearby citizen or an output.\n3. **Plan Interactions:** Given that there are multiple citizens close by, this is a prime opportunity to transform them into blessed forms.\n4. **Wall Usage:** There are walls around that prevent the movement of both cursed and blessed sprites. I should use that to my advantage.\n\nSince my position is (12, 24), let's evaluate nearby options:\n- I could move to interact with citizens at (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 10), (12, 11), or utilize the output at (12, 31).\n- The goal is to potentially transform as many citizens as possible into blessed forms, while avoiding creating any cursed forms.\n\nConsidering this, I need to act to gain access to the citizens while ensuring my position remains strategic. I will move up (since the wall directly above at (11, 24) prevents movement there and forces me through a citizen interaction).\n\nI will attempt to move left first:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis should allow me to reposition and access one of the citizens while monitored for upcoming transformations without risking multiple cursed sprites in play."
