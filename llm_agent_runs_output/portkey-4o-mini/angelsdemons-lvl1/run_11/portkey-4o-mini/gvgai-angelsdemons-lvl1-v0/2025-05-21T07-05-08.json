The nearby cursed sprite is located at (row=1, col=18), and there is another one at (row=1, col=19). Maintaining control over the curses is critical to not losing.\n\n### Possible Actions Based on Strategy:\n- **Engage with citizens** to transform them and remove potential future threats. \n- **Avoid cursed sprites** while ensuring that you effectively manage the interactions of citizens.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will move **up** to position (row=11, col=2). This may provide a clearer view of upcoming citizens and strategic interactions while keeping my avatar safe from immediate curses. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis movement should allow better management of the citizen sprites and put me in a position to advocate for their transformation in the following moves."

Currently, no cursed sprites are present near the avatar, but it's important to keep an eye on the citizens, as they can transform into cursed sprites when interacting with certain entities.\n- There are citizens nearby (symbols '&') that could potentially interact with the avatar or other sprites, making it important to manage their interactions carefully.\n- The avatar might benefit from moving towards safer areas where fewer transformations to cursed sprites can occur.\n\nTo take action, I will move the avatar to the left (to (12, 1)). This may help to better assess and control the situation around citizens while avoiding possible threats.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis move is in line with the strategy of minimizing risk and managing citizen interactions effectively.

To the left and right of my current position, the sprites are citizens (`%` and `&`).\n- There are no bolts threatening from adjacent cells, which is favorable.\n\nThe goal right now is to potentially transform some citizens into blessed ones to increase the score and mitigate future risks from curses.\n\n### Evaluating Movement Options:\n1. Moving **left** (to (12, 1)) would bring the avatar closer to a citizen which could potentially be a strategy to transform it. \n2. Moving **right** (to (12, 3)) keeps the same risk level and focuses on moving towards the c (`c`).\n3. Moving **up** or **down** would have limited effect as the next cell up (11, 2) is a box (obstacle), and down (13, 2) is also a wall.\n\nConsidering the options, moving **left** toward the citizen seems optimal to possibly transform it into a blessed sprite.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this to be beneficial as it positions me directly next to a citizen for potential transformation into a blessed sprite."
