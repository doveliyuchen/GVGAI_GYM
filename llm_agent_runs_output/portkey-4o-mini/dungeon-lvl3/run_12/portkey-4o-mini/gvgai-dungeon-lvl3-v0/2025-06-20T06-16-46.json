Currently, the avatar is located at row 18, column 10.\n\nLet's consider the next move:\n\n- **Immediate goal**: The avatar should focus on collecting resources and moving towards the exit ('x' or '$' in this case). The exit is found at row 2, column 4.\n- **Resources available**: There are multiple gold ('*') resources and a key ('b') within the vicinity, and we can see that there is a key located at (12, 7), which can be beneficial if there are locked doors ahead.\n\n**Analyzing Possible Moves**:\n1. The avatar can move UP to row 17, column 10, but there are no resources or hazards spotted directly above.\n2. Moving DOWN to row 19, column 10 leads to an empty space (no hazards or resources).\n3. Moving LEFT to row 18, column 9 is also empty.\n4. Moving RIGHT to row 18, column 11 is also empty.\n\nSince all immediate adjacent spaces to the avatar are empty, we should consider the safest strategic move in accordance with the game's principle of staying alive while planning for future actions. \n\nGiven that the avatar needs to begin making progress and since the potential for encounters lies mainly upwards, moving UP is the optimal action for this turn, as it allows us to possibly explore more of the upper screen in future moves.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action should reorient the avatar upwards and allow navigation of the space, adhering to the strategy of finding resources and reaching the exit efficiently. I expect to either find items on the next turn or gain information about further routes."
