The exit is located at (2, 4), which is quite far above, and there are many keys available as resources throughout the layout.\n\nSince the avatar is currently positioned at (19, 10) and there are a few key considerations:\n1. To the right, at (19, 11), is a key resource.\n2. Moving up or down might not be effective due to the walls.\n\nThe strategy suggests that the avatar should focus on collecting resources before attempting to reach the exit. Since the left and down actions are not possible due to walls and the only right action leads to a key, I will take action to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nCollecting the key is a solid step to increase my resources and avoid being stuck later. This aligns with the strategy of resource management and planning for the exit."
