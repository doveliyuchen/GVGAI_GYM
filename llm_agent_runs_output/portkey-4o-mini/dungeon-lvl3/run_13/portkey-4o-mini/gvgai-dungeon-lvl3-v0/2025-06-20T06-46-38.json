The exit (marked as '$') is at (2, 4), and the avatar is quite far from the exit, needing to navigate through obstacles and collect possible resources along the way (like gold '*').\n\nSince the avatar's position did not change last time, I will need to first determine a direction to move. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Map Analysis:** The avatar has limited movement options due to walls and the layout. The immediate options for movement from (19, 9) are primarily to the left (19, 8) or some upward and downward paths which are limited because of the surrounding walls and layout.\n\n2. **Objective:** The goal is to reach the exit by avoiding hazards and collecting resources. Even though there are collectibles like gold nearby, it's crucial to maintain a safe path to avoid hazards and potentially collect keys and other resources.\n\n3. **Movement Consideration:** I will first try to move left as my immediate option, as it appears to be a step toward an open space.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis means moving LEFT towards (19, 8), which also allows for further navigation options in the next move. I expect to see the avatar's position change and open up new pathways."

(traversable tile)\n  \n### Strategy:\n1. **Movement**: Since your avatar has a number of options for navigating towards the exit, you should aim to move closer to the exit (2, 4).\n2. **Health Safety**: Focus on routes that avoid direct hazards, even though at (16, 10) there are no immediate hazards in adjacent tiles.\n3. **Path Planning**: Given that you may need to rotate before moving, ensure you are aware of your alignment and direction.\n\n### Action Plan:\nChoose an action that moves you towards a path that gets you closer to the exit. I recommend moving **UP** to (15, 10), as this creates a more vertical distance effectively towards the exit path at row 2.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action positions you to further evaluate and continue towards the exit strategy while avoiding hazards."

However, proximity to fire or other hazards may affect choices.\n3. **Moving Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: This action may yield more walls ('k'), making navigation difficult.\n4. **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: Since there's gold ('*') at two nearby locations that can increase scoring points, it could be beneficial.\n\nAssuming the last position was checked and no movement happened, it's best to first attempt moving to the right towards known easier paths (which could mean more reward or less hazards).\n\n``` Action:2 ```  \n\nI expect to move towards a position where the avatar could collect gold or further explore open spaces.
