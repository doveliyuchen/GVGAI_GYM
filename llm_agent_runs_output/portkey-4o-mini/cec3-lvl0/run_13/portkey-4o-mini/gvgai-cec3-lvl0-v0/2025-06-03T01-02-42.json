The strategy includes using boxes strategically and accessing the holes to score points.\n\nSince the avatar can bounce on boxes or possibly place a box in a hole, I will first attempt to move the box at (5, 21) to the left into the hole at (5, 20). However, since the box is passive, I will need to consider the mechanics related to box movement and positioning carefully.\n\nHowever, moving left will not yield any result due to the wall there. The only effective move seems to be moving down or up, but there seems to be no obstacles to the immediate down movement.\n\nThus, I will move **down** to (6, 23).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action seems appropriate as it keeps the avatar away from potential walls, allowing for further strategic positioning next turn."

Moving here would allow the avatar to possibly bounce the box or move it.\n2. **Move RIGHT (5, 24)**: This position contains a wall 'w', and the avatar cannot move here.\n3. **Move UP (4, 23)**: This position also contains a wall 'w', and the avatar cannot move here.\n4. **Move DOWN (6, 23)**: This position contains a wall 'w', so moving down is not possible.\n\nWith the only valid move being to the left (5, 22), that will allow for strategic box manipulation.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven the only possible move will progress in the game, I will take the action to move left towards the box.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis move is strategic as it allows interaction with the box, which is key to achieving the win condition by removing all boxes from the level."

The adjacent tiles are as follows:\n\n- (5, 21) -> Box (`@`), which I can interact with to score points or achieve objectives.\n- (5, 23) -> Empty floor (`.`), which I can move to if I decide to.\n\nSince the primary objective is to remove all boxes while collecting coins or avoiding enemies, my next action should focus on either pushing the box or moving to an advantageous position. I have a box directly next to me at (5, 21), which I can push.\n\nA sensible action would be to move left towards the box at (5, 21) to push it or attempt to use it strategically.\n\nGiven this situation, I will choose to move left to (5, 21).\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to allow me to engage with the box directly, potentially leading me closer to achieving my objective of removing all boxes."
