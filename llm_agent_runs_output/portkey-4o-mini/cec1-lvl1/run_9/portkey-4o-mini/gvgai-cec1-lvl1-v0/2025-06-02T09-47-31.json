    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the player's avatar (`a`) is located at position (9, 14). The immediate area around it includes several enemy aliens (`@`) on the same row and nearby rows. The primary goal is to eliminate these enemies while preserving the avatar's life.\n\nThe key points to note are:\n- The avatar can either move or shoot in order to engage or evade these enemies.\n- The surrounding aliens could pose a risk if I remain stationary, as there are multiple enemies in proximity.\n  \nGiven that the strategic focus is on taking out enemies efficiently and I am standing still in a risky position, I will take an action that allows me to reposition.\n\nChoosing to move left (from (9, 14) to (9, 13)) gets me closer to an edge of the enemy cluster without moving into direct danger. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of repositioning to gain a tactical advantage against the enemies while maintaining avatar safety."
