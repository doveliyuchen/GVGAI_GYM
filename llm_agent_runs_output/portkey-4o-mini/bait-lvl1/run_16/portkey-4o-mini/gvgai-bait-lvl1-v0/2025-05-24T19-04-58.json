Since this game uses grid-based movement, and to prioritize collecting the key at the current position, I will proceed with an action that would allow character interaction.\n\n``` Action: ACTION_NIL ```\nI will remain in my position to effectively collect the key state here without further movement, ensuring strategic alignment with the primary objective."

    "content": "To proceed with the current state, we need to understand the vital elements in our surroundings. From the map:\n\n- Your avatar's current state is 'nokey' (indicated by '&'), and it is located at (3, 6).\n- Nearby, we have:\n  - A 'key' at (6, 6) and accessible from the bottom row.\n  - A 'hole' at (5, 6) and other entities that need to be navigated around.\n\nOur immediate goal is to collect the key to transition to the 'withkey' state for further gameplay. Since the key is two rows down and directly aligned vertically to our avatar position (both in column 6), the most straightforward action here is to maneuver downward.\n\n### Strategic Move\nGiven the available actions and the current game mechanics, the first action should be to move down one space to (4, 6), keeping in mind to avoid the hole at (5, 6) when we then go further down for the key.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down toward (4, 6) seems ideal to move closer to the key without compromising safety. If successful, we should be able to continue down to secure the key next."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the player needs to navigate through the map to collect the key ('%') located at (row 7, col 6) in order to progress to the goal ('#') located at (row 1, col 6). \n\nThe avatar's position isn't explicitly provided in the state description, but based on the map layout where immovable items (walls and holes) are placed, the player must approach the key safely without risking falling into any holes ('$') or colliding with other harmful sprites.\n\n### Strategy Review\n1. **Key Acquisition:** The priority is to get to the key at (7, 6).\n2. **Safety First:** Navigate around any hazardous elements and ensure that we do not fall through holes.\n\nLet's say the current position of the avatar is at the closest feasible point to reach the key without any obstacles obstructing the way. \n\n### Action Selection\nIf we assume the avatar is at (8, 6), which is just above the key's position, the next available action to move down into (7, 6) to collect the key is `ACTION_DOWN`.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to safely move to the key, enabling a state change from 'nokey' to 'withkey', reflecting a successful acquisition towards reaching the goal."
