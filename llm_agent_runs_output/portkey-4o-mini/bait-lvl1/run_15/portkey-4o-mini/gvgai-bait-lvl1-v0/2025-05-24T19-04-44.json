The immediate objectives are:\n1. Collect a key to transform from the nokey state to withkey.\n2. After acquiring the key, navigate towards the goal denoted by `#`.\n\nOn the map:\n- The key is located at (7, 6), marked by `%`.\n- The goal is at (1, 6), marked by `#`.\n\nGiven that the avatar is currently a nokey (`&`), I should aim to collect the key first. The immediate path to the key involves moving downwards to (4, 6), which has a box (`@`). \n\nFor now, I will move downwards from (3, 6) to (4, 6) where the box is (`@`), then I can strategize on how to possibly bounce off the box towards the key location.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to put me in a better position as I will be able to assess the situation further from (4, 6) next turn."

    "content": "To analyze the current state, we note that there are various elements around the avatar that will determine the next move. The current avatar position is not explicitly mentioned, but typically we can infer where the avatar might start based on the layout.\n\n### State Analysis:\n1. There are walls (`*`) all around the grid. \n2. The goal (`#`) is located at (1, 6), and it's critical to reach it.\n3. The key floor (`%`) is at (7, 6), which we need to collect.\n4. The `nokey` state (&) can be found at (4, 6), and we need to change to `withkey` by touching the key.\n5. The holes (`$`) present at (5, 6) and (6, 6) must be avoided.\n6. Boxes (`@`) are located at (4, 2) and (4, 10), which may be used for bouncing or navigation.\n\n### Current Strategy:\nSince the avatar starts in a `nokey` state, the first logical action would be to reach the key at (7, 6). Given there are no current coordinates provided for the avatar, let's assume it starts adjacent to the key or the path towards it is clear. \n\n### Available Directions:\n- Move `DOWN` to (5, 6) which is a hole (avoid this).\n- Move `UP` to (3, 6) which is an empty space (can be navigated).\n- Move `LEFT` or `RIGHT` would allow us to navigate horizontally, but we first need to be in a position to get to the key vertically.\n\nGiven the standard grid, and inferring the next best action, I will choose to move `UP` from our assumed starting position to move toward a path where we can definitely access the key without hitting a hole.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action of moving up should provide us with space to navigate based on our previous analysis toward collecting the key, thereby transitioning to the `withkey` state through further moves. Let's see if this aligns with the goal of ultimately reaching (1,6)."

The key is located at (7, 6) where the sprite is represented as '%' (key).\n\nThe avatar is in the nokey state, meaning it cannot directly access the goal. The primary action should be to navigate to the key first, as collecting it is essential for progressing towards the goal.\n\n### Strategy\nI need to navigate down to (4, 6) to collect the box first which is near (4, 2) and then reach the key. However, I cannot move to the right directly to (3, 7) since it's a wall, hence, I'll opt for an upward move.\n\n### Decision\nLet's move from (3, 6) to (2, 6) to analyze further options. \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will allow me to proceed upward, checking the possibilities ahead and ensuring there are paths leading to the key."

This brings me closer to safely exploring more rows without immediate danger of falling into a hole while maintaining proximity to the key access path.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this action to allow the avatar to continue navigating while keeping clear of hazards and allowing better access toward the goal and key."
