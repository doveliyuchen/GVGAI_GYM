However, there is a hole directly at (6, 6), making it impossible to collect the key there safely.\n- The goal is positioned at (1, 6), and reaching it without the key would be futile because the avatar cannot pass through the goal without first acquiring the key.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven that moving down (ACTION_DOWN) to (3, 6) would let me reposition myself away from the hazards and make use of the boxes or other paths, I will choose to move down since it keeps options open while avoiding the hole directly beneath the key.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n``` \n\nThis action positions the avatar lower in the column without risking immediate loss and better prepares for subsequent strategic moves.
