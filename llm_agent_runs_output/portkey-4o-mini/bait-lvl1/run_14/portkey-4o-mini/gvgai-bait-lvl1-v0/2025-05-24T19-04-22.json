The only immediate focus should be collecting a key, represented by `%`, which is located at position (7, 6).\n\nGiven the layout:\n- There are walls to the left and right of the avatar (positions (3, 5) and (3, 7)).\n- The down direction (to position (4, 6)) is clear.\n- Moving up (to (2, 6)) is blocked by the wall.\n\nSince the only viable move is down to (4, 6), I will choose to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to move closer to the goal of collecting the key, which is crucial for progressing in the game.

The key is located at (7, 6) (`%`) and must be collected to transform from `nokey` to `withkey`.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Falling into Holes**: The hole is directly below at (5, 6). Moving down would result in an instant game over.\n2. **Move to Collect the Key**: The next priority should be to move towards the key at (7, 6).\n\nGiven the current options:\n- **Moving Up (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move and does not pose a risk (the floor is clear).\n- **Moving Left (to (4, 5))**: The floor is clear, but it moves us away from our goal of reaching the key.\n- **Moving Right (to (4, 7))**: The floor is clear as well but also away from the key.\n- **Moving Down**: Would land in a hole, which is a loss condition.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nThe best action is to move **up** towards (3, 6) to navigate toward the goal while avoiding the hole.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up is a safe action that aims to position towards the ultimate goal of collecting the key and safely navigating through the level."
