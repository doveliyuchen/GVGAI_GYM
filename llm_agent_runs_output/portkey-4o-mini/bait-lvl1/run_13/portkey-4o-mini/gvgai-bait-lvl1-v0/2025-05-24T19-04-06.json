The map reveals the following locations of importance:\n\n- The key (`%`) is located at row 7, column 6.\n- The goal (`#`) is located at row 1, column 6.\n- There are boxes (`@`) at row 4, column 2 and row 4, column 10.\n\nSince I do not have my avatar position mentioned in the current state, let's assume I need to navigate towards the key first to be able to unlock the goal. \n\n### Immediate Next Steps\n1. **Collect the Key**: I need to get my avatar to row 7, column 6 where the key is located. \n2. **Avoid Hazards**: I need to ensure I avoid holes (`$`) located at row 5, column 6 and row 6, column 6.\n\n### Current Position Assumption\nIf I have not moved yet or my initial position is somewhere safe, I should assess any available moves towards the key.\n\n### Available Moves to Reach the Key\nTo navigate towards the key, I can perform the following actions:\n- If I am at row 6, I can move down to row 7 to collect the key directly.\n- If I start further up, I need to navigate down through the corresponding cols avoiding walls and hazards.\n\nIn this case, assuming I'm at row 6, col 6 (right above the key), I should:\n\n``` \nAction:3  # Move down to row 7, col 6 to collect the key.\n```\n\n**Feedback on Action:** This action should take my avatar directly to the key location and allow me to collect it, which aligns with our strategy of prioritizing key collection."
