The goal ('#') is located at (row=1, col=6). \n\nThe strategy outlines the importance of avoiding hazards like holes ('$') and mushrooms ('m'), collecting keys, and reaching the goal. In this situation, we need to collect the key before heading towards the goal since our avatar is currently at 'nokey' state.\n\nThe available actions are:\n- ACTION_LEFT (1)\n- ACTION_RIGHT (2)\n- ACTION_DOWN (3)\n- ACTION_UP (4)\n\nGiven the key is directly adjacent to the avatar's presumed position, the next appropriate action is to move **down** to collect the key located at (row=6, col=6).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to successfully interact with the key and change the avatar's state to 'withkey'."
