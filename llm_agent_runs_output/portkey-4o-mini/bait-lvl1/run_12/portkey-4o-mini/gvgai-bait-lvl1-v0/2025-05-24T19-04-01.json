The avatar is currently located at (2, 6) on the grid, navigating around the game map, which is surrounded by walls and various interactable elements.\n\n- **Key at (6, 6)**: The key is located below the avatar's current position.\n- **Goal at (1, 6)**: The goal is located directly above the avatar.\n- **Hazards (Holes) at (5, 6) and (6, 6)**: There are holes below the avatar (both spots at (5, 6) and (6, 6)) which can be dangerous.\n\nGiven that the avatar currently holds 'nokey', the objective is to collect the key at (6, 6) to transition to 'withkey', while avoiding any hazards. Since the avatar's last position did not change from previous actions, we need to select a meaningful action to improve the state.\n\nThe ideal action would be to move **downward** to (3, 6), which enables the avatar to reach the vicinity of where the key is placed, progressing towards collecting it. \n\nThus, I will choose the following action:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis movement is expected to bring the avatar closer to the key and prevent any unnecessary hazards, aligning with my strategy of first collecting the key."

Moving Up would return to 'A' (nokey floor), Left leads to '.', and Right leads to another '@' (box), which does not help in collecting the key.\n\nA logical action to take that aligns with our strategy of collecting the key first is to move **Down**. This immediate exploration is crucial as collecting the key will facilitate enabling movement towards the goal afterwards.\n\nHence, I will perform the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is expected to allow the avatar to collect the key, which will transform its state and enable progressing towards the goal."
