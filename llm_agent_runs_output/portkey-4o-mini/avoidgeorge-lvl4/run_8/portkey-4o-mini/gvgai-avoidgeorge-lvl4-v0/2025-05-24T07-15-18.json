The best immediate action would be to:\n\n- Move the avatar down to (10, 14) to pick up the cigarette. \n\nEven though this action doesn't directly accomplish transforming an annoyed sprite yet, it strategically positions the avatar to enable that move in future turns and gain a critical item to influence the game state.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action will allow the avatar to access the cigarette and prepare for potential transformation of 'annoyed' sprites in the next moves.

My avatar's current position (8, 13) keeps some safe distance from George, who is several rows up.\n2. **Transformations**: Using a cigarette to transform an 'annoyed' sprite into a 'quiet' state could greatly reduce threats. The nearest 'annoyed' sprite is at (5, 16).\n3. **More movement**: Since my position has not changed since the last state, I won\u2019t use action 0 (ACTION_NIL).\n4. **Moving**: To approach and kill George or use the cigarette effectively, I'll need to navigate the map.

To do this, the avatar could try to move closer to George and eliminate one.\n3. **Transform Annoyed Sprites**: Utilize the cigarette ('%') which has limited uses to convert annoyed sprites into quiet sprites if nearing a cigarette is possible.\n4. **Maintain Avatar**: Ensuring at least one avatar remains by keeping movement strategic and making effective use of interactions.\n\n### Available Actions:\n**From Current Position (7, 13):**\n- Up (to 6, 13): Open space, possibly moving towards a cigarette or encountering annoyed sprites.\n- Down (to 8, 13): Open space as well, further exploring or potentially moving towards other interactions.\n- Left (to 7, 12): Open space as well, not directly engaging with any characters at the moment.\n- Right (to 7, 14): Free space, to check nearby chaser positions.\n- Use action may not be applicable immediately unless nearer to a cigarette or a target.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the position of George and the annoyed sprites, I should move **up** from my current location (7, 13) to (6, 13).
