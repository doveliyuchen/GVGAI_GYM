The avatar can only move up or down.\n- Moving up to (6, 8) or down to (8, 8) seems to be viable options since both are empty spaces.\n\nI'll choose to move down to (8, 8), which keeps the avatar moving toward the bottom of the grid while keeping an eye on nearby states.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar down, and I expect to explore further interactions with the nearby NPCs or objects after this move."

Although this movement will not interact with any other sprite at the moment, it gets us into a strategic position to analyze our next interaction.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action will rotate the avatar towards the up and I expect that it can help me navigate better toward possible interactions in the upcoming moves."

There are several `c` (annoyed) NPCs that need to be turned into `#` (quiet) NPCs to maximize the score, particularly near the avatar's location. The primary goal is to change the states of these NPCs while avoiding the chaser `@` (George) located at (7, 6) and (7, 7).\n\n### Nearby Targets:\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n  - **(6, 8)**: Empty (.)\n  - **(7, 7)**: Chaser (`@`)\n  - **(7, 9)**: Empty (.)\n  \nTo the south of the avatar, there are `c` NPCs at:\n- **(8, 13)**: (c)\n- **(8, 14)**: (c)\n \nThe chaser at (7, 6) needs to be avoided.\n\n### Strategy Application\nOur overall strategy emphasizes:\n1. Avoiding direct interactions with George unless necessary.\n2. Prioritizing the interaction with the `cigarette` to turn annoyed NPCs (`c`) into quiet NPCs (`#`).\n3. Navigating carefully to maintain distance from chasing NPCs while aiming to manipulate others efficiently.\n\n### Action Plan\nWith this analysis:\n1. The chosen action should move towards a location with more `c` (annoyed NPCs), allowing for more scoring opportunities through the `cigarette`.\n2. Moving **down** toward (8, 8) will be strategic to avoid immediate conflict with George and allow future interactions with the annoyed sprites.\n\n### Final Decision\nSince the avatar's position doesn't change yet and we want to explore more effectively towards the (8, 8) area,\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should help maintain distance from the chaser while providing a path towards useful NPCs. Expect to see more available moves towards converting annoyances into points in the next step."
