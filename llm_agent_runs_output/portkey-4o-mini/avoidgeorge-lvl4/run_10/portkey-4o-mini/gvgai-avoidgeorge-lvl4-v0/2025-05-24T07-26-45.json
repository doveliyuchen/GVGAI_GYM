Moving left (to (7, 2)) is a valid option but leads to empty space.\n2. Moving right (to (7, 4)) is also empty.\n3. Moving down (to (8, 3)) is also an empty space.\n4. Moving up (to (6, 3)), leads to an empty space.\n\nGiven the sprites' positions, moving to an empty adjacent space seems the most sensible without compromising the avatar's safety.\n\n### Action Selection\nI will take the action to move **left to (7, 2)** since this is a safe option, allowing us to reposition without encountering any hazards immediately.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI expect this action will allow me to avoid the 'george' and potentially maneuver towards opportunities to handle the annoyed sprite later."
