(empty space).\n  - Right (row 6, col 6): This is a '.' (empty space).\n\nThe avatar currently can't move left or right due to empty spaces and can choose to move up or down to interact with crates. \n\n### Strategy Review:\n- Crates can be used to navigate around or through obstacles. If I move up or down, I might find myself in a strategic position depending on what lies above or below.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will move **down**, to row 7, column 5, where there is a crate. This may provide more options for movement in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows me to interact with the nearby crates, potentially leading to a strategic advantage in my next move."
