The avatar is currently positioned at (row=11, col=6).\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- **Avatar Position**: (11, 6)\n- **Nearby Entities**:\n  - (10, 6): a boulder ('@') is directly above the avatar.\n  - (11, 5): a free space ('.') to the left.\n  - (11, 7): a free space ('.') to the right.\n  - (12, 6): a free space ('.') below.\n- **Nearby Hazards and Collectibles**:\n  - The boulder directly above could drop, posing a danger.\n  - No diamonds or enemies are immediately next to the avatar.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n1. **Movement Options**:\n    - Move left (col 5) - to a free space but away from useful resources.\n    - Move right (col 7) - to another free space also away from resources.\n    - Move down (row 12, col 6) - to a free space which is safer since it is below the boulder.\n    - Moving up (row 10, col 6) would bring the avatar into a possible hazard range with the boulder above.\n\nGiven that the boulder is directly above and poses an immediate threat, it's critical to move downward to ensure safety.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nMoving down into (12, 6) allows the avatar to avoid the falling boulder and continue strategizing for diamond collection without immediate risk. This aligns with the strategy of avoiding hazards and planning for resource collection."

(empty)\n- Down (row=12, col=6): 'b' (wall)\n- Left (row=11, col=5): '.' (empty)\n- Right (row=11, col=7): '.' (empty)\n\nSince the avatar can only move into empty spaces, the possible movements are:\n- Up to (10, 6): valid\n- Down to (12, 6): not valid (wall)\n- Left to (11, 5): valid\n- Right to (11, 7): valid\n\nIn the context of the game strategy, we want to navigate through the level, maximize diamond collection and avoid hazards. Since there are no immediate threats, I will explore the area.\n\nAmong the valid moves, moving Up to (10, 6) might provide more options to explore vertically, but I cannot see beyond that row. The left (to 11, 5) and right (to 11, 7) moves will keep me closer to my current path, allowing me potential access to nearby items if they are located just to the sides.\n\nHowever, considering we are looking for a strategy that allows movement and exploration, I will choose to move Left to (11, 5) which is still an open space.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nMoving left keeps my options open to explore further and is a reasonable strategy to gather resources as they become visible."

However, since the avatar's current score or number of diamonds hasn't been explicitly mentioned, I'll assume that collecting the exit right now is valid if we don\u2019t exceed the limits.\n\n### Strategy Suggestion:\n- Given the exit's position and my current location, the logical action would be to move to the right and step through the exit.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- I anticipate that moving right will allow the avatar to reach the exit successfully if there are no additional conditions linked to diamond counts that have not been mentioned.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the exit, fulfilling the win condition if the state concerning diamonds has been managed correctly."
