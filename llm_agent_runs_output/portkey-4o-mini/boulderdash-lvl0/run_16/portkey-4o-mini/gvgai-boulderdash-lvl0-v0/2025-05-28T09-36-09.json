(background)\n\nGiven that an enemy (the crab) is directly above the avatar, and the next tiles to the immediate left and right are empty, my current options for movement can lead to unfavorable consequences. \n\nThe overarching strategy encourages clever use of positioning to avoid fights wherever possible. In this case, moving left or right would allow me to avoid the crab, allowing me to explore without taking damage.\n\n### Available Actions\n1. **Action Left (2)**: Move to (11, 5), an empty space.\n2. **Action Right (3)**: Move to (11, 7), also an empty space.\n3. **Action Up (5)**: Move to (10, 6) but that would cause direct engagement with an enemy.\n4. **Action Down (4)**: Move to (12, 6) which is blocked.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving up to engage the crab would not be advisable, and both left and right are viable actions, I will take the safe route and move left.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left seems strategically sound to navigate around the crab safely. The expectation is to reposition closer to the diamonds located in the adjacent columns safely."
