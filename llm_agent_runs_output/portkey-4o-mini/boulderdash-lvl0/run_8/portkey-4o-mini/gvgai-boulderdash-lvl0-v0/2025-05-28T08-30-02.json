Moving left (to (11, 8)) keeps potential movement options open for the next turn.\n2. Moving up (to (10, 9)) allows closer access to the boulder at (10, 13) and the nearby diamonds.\n\nHowever, to maximize scoring and minimize confrontation with blocks:\n- I will opt to move **up**, as this allows potential access to further diamonds and explores a vertical route that seems less congested.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect that moving up may provide better access to diamonds and strategize towards reaching the exit."
