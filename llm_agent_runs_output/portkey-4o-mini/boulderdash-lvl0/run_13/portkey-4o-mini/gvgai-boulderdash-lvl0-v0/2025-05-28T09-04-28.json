Moving towards the diamond should be contemplated while avoiding paths that could lead to direct confrontation.\n3. **Path to the Diamond:** The path from (11,6) to (1,6) does not have direct enemies in-between but could intersect with paths leading to enemies if not carefully navigated.\n\n### Action Selection\nSince the current action state does not indicate any movement from the last action (assuming the player is facing down), the next logical action is to move the avatar up to maximize collection of resources.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up towards (row=10, col=6), getting closer to the diamond at (row=1, col=6).
