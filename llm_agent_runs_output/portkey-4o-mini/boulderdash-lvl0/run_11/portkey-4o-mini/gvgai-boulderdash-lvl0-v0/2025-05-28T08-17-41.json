From this position, the immediate surrounding tiles are:\n\n- Up (row 10, column 6): '@' (a boulder)\n- Down (row 12, column 6): 'b' (a wall)\n- Left (row 11, column 5): '.' (empty background)\n- Right (row 11, column 7): '.' (empty background)\n\nTo make progress, the avatar can either move left or right. Moving left (to (11, 5)) would lead into an empty tile, while moving right (to (11, 7)) would also lead to an empty tile. Since there are no immediate threats or resources in the adjacent tiles and considering the strategy of maintaining movement and exploration, I will choose to move right, keeping options open and staying clear of walls or hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nMoving right allows exploration of a new tile and avoids any conflict with enemies or walls, aligning with the strategy of safely navigating the level."

The next tile to consider for movement or engagement is the surrounding area, particularly since there are several diamonds and a few enemies in the vicinity.\n\nI need to assess my next move carefully since my avatar is currently surrounded by a lot of potential paths.

The player is surrounded by a wall downward and a boulder on the left.\n2. The enemy is directly above the avatar. If the avatar moves upwards to row 10, column 7, they will come into contact with the enemy and become vulnerable.\n3. The right space (row 11, col 8) is empty and allows movement without risk of immediate threats.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that moving upwards is dangerous due to the enemy, and left has a boulder, the optimal action is to move right into the open space. \n\n### Recommended Action\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to safely reposition without encountering any enemies while positioning itself better for subsequent actions and resource collection."
