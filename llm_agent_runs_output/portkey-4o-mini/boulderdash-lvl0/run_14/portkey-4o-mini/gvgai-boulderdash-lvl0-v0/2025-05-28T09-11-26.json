(background).\n  - Right (11, 7): '.' (background).\n\n### Analysis of the Situation\n- I have a boulder directly above me at (10, 6), which means I cannot move up.\n- I can move left to (11, 5) or right to (11, 7), both of which are background spaces and will not lead to any obstacle immediately.\n- The objective here is to explore and potentially collect diamonds, while also avoiding unnecessary engagements that might lead to negative score outcomes.\n\n### Strategy\nCurrently, moving to the left (11, 5) or right (11, 7) will not significantly impact the game, but since I need to act differently than the previous state, I should consider movement.\n\nSince both left and right are free of enemies (thus neutral) and will not interact with any collectibles or threats, I can choose either. For a change in position that does not revert to the same action again, I will move right to (11, 7) because it potentially opens up more options for future moves without engaging with any boulders or walls.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action allows for continued exploration while staying safe from threats.
