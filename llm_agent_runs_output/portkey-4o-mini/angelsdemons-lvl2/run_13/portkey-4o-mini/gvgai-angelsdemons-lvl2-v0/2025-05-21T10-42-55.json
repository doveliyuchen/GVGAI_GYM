This is not possible.\n4. **Up (ACTION_UP = 4)**: Moves the avatar up to (11, 11) where there is a 'b' (sky). This is possible too.\n\nGiven that transforming citizens into blessed ones is only possible through specific interactions with bolts or salvation sprites and there is a need to manage cursed citizens, another useful action could also involve moving toward the portal to complete the level.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nUpon considering the necessity of movement and the current positioning of the avatar, I recommend **moving up** to (11, 11) as this keeps the avatar mobile, allows future interactions with nearby sprites, and keeps options open for transforming citizens.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up is strategic as it maintains the avatar's mobility while exploring further interactions that could lead to increasing the score and managing cursed citizens."
