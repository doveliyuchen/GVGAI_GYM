In my vicinity:\n\n- I can see citizens at (12, 6), (12, 12), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 26).\n- There are boxes (which can be manipulated) at (4, 4) to (4, 7), and (5, 11) to (5, 13). \n\nSince my avatar's prior position is unchanged, I'll first evaluate nearby citizens for possible conversions and the potential impact on score as well as the threat level of bolts ('$') and demons ('b').\n\n### Analysis of Potential Actions:\n1. **Moving Right (to (12, 5))**: \n   - Leads to a sky tile ('d').\n   - No new interactions or immediate citizens reachable.\n\n2. **Moving Left (to (12, 3))**:\n   - Leads to a sky tile ('d').\n   - Also offers no new interactions.\n\n3. **Moving Down (to (13, 4))**:\n   - Lands on a wall ('s').\n   - Blocked by an obstacle.\n\n4. **Moving Up (to (11, 4))**:\n   - Also lands on a wall ('s').\n   - Blocked.\n\nWith no immediate threats from bolts or transformed sprites around my current row, my best option appears to be moving right to try to engage with the nearby citizens more effectively.\n\nSince I cannot advance up, down, or left, and moving right only leads to an empty tile, I should proceed with the upward action cautiously, which allows me to check for threats above me.\n\n### Conclusion\nI will take action to the right but expect that it might not lead to a fruitful interaction. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI'm testing a right move to verify if any interactions abound at the next column and to determine my next strategy for citizen conversion and prevention of curses."
