My objective is to manage the flow of citizens and avoid any transformations into cursed sprites, while ensuring that my actions align with the game's win conditions.\n\nSince my last position hasn't changed, my avatar may need to rotate before moving. I'll analyze my surroundings:\n\n- The avatar is next to several citizens represented as '&', at (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 12), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 24), and (12, 25).\n- There is a salvation port 'b' located at (12, 31) which might be a target for citizens.\n  \nGiven that the avatar is facing vertically and is far from the input area, I need to reposition so I can effectively gather citizens toward the output area.\n\n## Action Strategy:\n1. I need to rotate my avatar first.\n2. After rotation, if my position remains unchanged, I can attempt to move right to position myself better for an upcoming action with the citizens.\n\nTaking this into consideration, my next action would be to move right:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis should allow me to reposition closer to the output area, ensuring that I am in a better place to interact with the citizens and direct them towards salvation."

The objective is to manage the flow of citizens and avoid any transformations into cursed statuses while directing them toward salvation. \n\nAction options include moving left, right, up, or down. Since my avatar's position has not changed from the previous state, I need to consider carefully how to act without wasting movement.\n\nThe immediate area around my avatar shows several citizens and two cursed sprites in column 12. There is also an output at column 31 that I can direct citizens towards. Given the strategy outlined, my next action should direct my avatar for better positioning to create a pathway for citizens toward salvation.\n\nTo maximize effectiveness and avoid the possibility of curse transformations, I will move my avatar to the left toward column 28, which may provide space to manage citizens without disturbing the cursed sprites. This movement can potentially help in optimizing my strategy by adjusting the positioning of citizens. \n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move will bring me closer to my intended objectives and further align with the strategy of managing citizens towards salvation."

Moving left to (12, 26) will result in interacting with the citizen ('&')\u2014possibly causing them to be processed.\n2. Moving right to (12, 28) might allow me to process a citizen ('c') but keeps me in the same row without yielding any immediate output.\n3. I cannot move up because there is a citizen at (11, 27) that might also be processed.\n4. Moving down is blocked by a wall.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince I can't move down or up, and I need to interact with the nearby citizens, moving left to (12, 26) seems to be a strategic choice as the interaction with the citizen ('&') could potentially lead to a transformation. My goal should be to adaptively manage the transformation of citizens, moving them towards salvation and avoiding curse situations.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the left to interact with a citizen, aiming to effectively manage the flow of citizens toward the output. I expect this to align with the strategy of processing citizens efficiently while preventing any curses from developing."
