    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is located at `(10, 10)`, has the ability to move and interact with the environment, and has acquired a key (indicated by `m`).\n\n### Analysis of Adjacent Spaces:\n- North `(9, 10)`: wall `w` (blocked)\n- South `(11, 10)`: wall `w` (blocked)\n- East `(10, 11)`: small goal (s)\n- West `(10, 9)`: empty floor (.)\n\n### Objective:\nThe immediate action that would aid in scoring points is to interact with the small goal directly to the east, which is at `(10, 11)`.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the avatar's current movement options are limited by walls to the north and south, moving east to interact with the small goal is a straightforward action that aligns with the objective to accumulate points.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move the avatar east to interact with the small goal. I expect to gain points from this and maintain optimal scoring strategy."
