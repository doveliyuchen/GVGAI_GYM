The primary objective is to collect as many goals as possible while navigating through the dungeon and avoiding potential threats. \n\nAnalyzing the surroundings, I see a key ('@') at (10, 10) to the left of my position, which can help in accessing small goals later on. Directly below me, there is a 'nokey' indicator ('%') at (10, 9), but I do not need it immediately. Additionally, I have a small goal right next to me at my current position, so it is advisable to collect it now.\n\nTo proceed, I will choose the action to collect the small goal, which is the 'ACTION_USE'. Here\u2019s the action: \n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action should allow me to gain a score from the small goal I am currently occupying, aligning perfectly with my strategy to collect goals systematically."
