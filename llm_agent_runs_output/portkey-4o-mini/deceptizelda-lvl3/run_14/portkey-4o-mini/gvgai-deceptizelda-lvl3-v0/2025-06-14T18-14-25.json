Verify access to `@` (key) first if near.\n2. Then move toward `&` (smallgoal) for immediate scoring.\n  \nAssuming our avatar is at `(10, 9)` right now (adjacent to the key):\n\n1.

This is essential as it will enable unlocking other objectives or doors later.\n  \nTaking this into consideration, I will perform the action to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action will leverage the key to enhance my combat capabilities against any enemies and ultimately facilitate unlocking other doors or reaching goals."

The key information from the current map shows:\n\n- The **avatar (a)** is not identified explicitly in the current map display; we assume it's at an open space not indicated by walls or objects.\n- **Goals**: \n  - The **smallgoal (&)** is located at (10, 11) \n  - The **largegoal (#)** is located at (8, 11)\n- **Keys**: There is a **key (@)** located at (10, 10). \n- **Enemies**: There is a monster normal ($) located at (3, 5) and (4, 7).\n- There is a **nokey (%),** which can be defeated to gain keys, located at (10, 9). \n\nTo progress efficiently, the avatar should first obtain the key (@) at (10, 10), then defeat the nokey (%), which will transform the avatar state and allow for easier achievements of goals.\n\nSince we should first move towards the key, the effective action will be to move **right** to (10, 10):\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action should align with the strategy of collecting necessary keys to unlock doors and achieve the goals."

Since the adjacent cell to the right (10, 11) contains the smallgoal, the action to take is to move right.\n\nThe expected action is:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action targets the smallgoal directly, aligning with the strategy of reaching goals efficiently.
