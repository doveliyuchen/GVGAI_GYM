The player should ideally move towards the key and the large goal ('#').\n\n3. **Strategic Actions**:\n   - Given the presence of the key ('@') directly to the right of the current position (presumably at Row 10, Column 9 or nearby), and considering the need to collect keys first to unlock goals, it is valuable to move in that direction.\n\nSince I don't have the precise player position but know there is a key available at Row 10, Column 10, the best action here is to collect that key by moving right:\n\n```Action: 3```\n\nBy taking this action, I expect the avatar to collect a key and thereby increase the possibilities for winning by reaching larger goals later."
