The accessible areas feature several static objects, with the small goal ('&') located at (10, 11), and there is also a sword ('s') at (10, 10). \n\nTo make progress, I need to focus on the primary objectives: obtaining the sword, because it will help me defeat enemies and collect points, and eventually reaching the small goal to score.\n\n### Analyzing Current Avatar Position\nThe avatar must navigate through the positions available. However, before achieving that, I'll have to first collect the sword at (10, 10) as a priority to prepare for combat scenarios in the near future.\n\n### Available Actions\n1. **ACTION_USE**: Not applicable as there are no immediate interactions.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT**: Moving left from (10, 11) would put me at (10, 10) where the sword is located.\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT**: Not applicable as I would go out of bounds.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN**: This would move to (11, 11), but that's adjacent to the wall.\n5. **ACTION_UP**: This would move to (9, 11), which has a wall as well.\n\n### Action Decision\nThe most logical first step is to move left to collect the sword. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action appears to align with the overall strategy of preparing for combat while simultaneously progressing toward my goal.
