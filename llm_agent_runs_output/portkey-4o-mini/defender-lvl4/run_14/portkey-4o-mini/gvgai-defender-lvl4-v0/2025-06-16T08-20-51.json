The avatar has the option to move down to (1,4), an open space.\n\n### Suggested Action\nGiven the strategy of avoiding being cornered and maintaining the avatar's safety while trying to gather resources or combat enemies, I will opt to move down.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aligns with maintaining movement freedom and avoiding direct confrontation until gathering resources or having an advantageous position."

Directly below your current position (at row 1, col 3), there is an alien enemy ('@') that poses an immediate threat if you remain in your current position.\n\nSince the position of the avatar has not changed, to act strategically based on the game rules and the suggested overall strategy, you should consider moving to avoid imminent danger and to position yourself better for resource management and enemy engagement.\n\nMoving down (to (1, 4)) may allow you to engage or evade a nearby alien. Hence, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action is expected to reposition the avatar out of immediate threat while keeping options open for collecting supplies or engaging enemies."
