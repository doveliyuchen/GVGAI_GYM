They pose a potential threat to the city.\n- The avatar has the ability to shoot at the aliens, but this requires the use of bullets, so resource management is crucial.\n- It seems wise to engage the closest alien threats to prevent them from getting too close to the city.\n\n### Strategy Recap\n1. **Prioritize Defense**: Focus on intercepting and shooting at the aliens before they can attack the city.\n2. **Movement**: Taking action to move towards the aliens will allow for a better offense to defend the city effectively.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince your current position (7, 1) will need to be adjusted to effectively target an alien, I will choose to move towards where the nearest alien threat exists. The alien at (1, 6) is currently positioned vertically closer than others, making it a critical threat.\n\nThus, my action will be to move **UP** to align higher vertically, optimizing my chance to engage a nearby enemy.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should help position my avatar closer to the enemy threats while maintaining a defensive stance towards the city. I expect the next turn to allow engagement with the nearby aliens, strengthening defense measures."
