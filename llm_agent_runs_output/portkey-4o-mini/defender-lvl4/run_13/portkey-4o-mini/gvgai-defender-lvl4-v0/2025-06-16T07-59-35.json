Here's a summary of possible actions:\n\n1. **Defend against aliens:** Since we have a concentration of aliens nearby (especially at `(1, 17)`, `(1, 18)`, etc.), immediate action might be to shoot at these aliens if in range.

I expect to either encounter an alien or reposition for an optimal shooting opportunity next turn."
