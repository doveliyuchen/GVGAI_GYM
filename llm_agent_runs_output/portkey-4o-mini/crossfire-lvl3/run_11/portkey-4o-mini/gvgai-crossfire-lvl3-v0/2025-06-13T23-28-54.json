Avoiding direct paths with turrets and bombs.\n2. Using walls to block potential explosions.\n\nBased on the avatar\u2019s current position:\n- Moving LEFT (to (10, 10)) would place it adjacent to a wall and does not make progress towards the goal.\n- Moving RIGHT (to (10, 12)) is possible, but it's not a meaningful move towards the goal.\n- Moving DOWN (to (11, 11)) is still not beneficial as it will only lead to another wall.\n- Moving UP (to (9, 11)) is also towards a wall.\n\nSince no left, right, down, or up directly leads towards the goal while avoiding immediate threats and improving position, I will try rotating to the UP and then moving UP again to see if that changes the position effectively.\n\nAction: ``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action keeps me focused on getting closer to the goal while avoiding potential hazards surrounding the current location.
