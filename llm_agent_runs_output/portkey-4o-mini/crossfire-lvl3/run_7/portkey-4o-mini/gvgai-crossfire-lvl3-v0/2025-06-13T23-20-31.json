The path towards the goal is obstructed by walls and other hazards, so careful movement is required.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. The goal is to reach (1, 3) from (10, 15). \n2. The avatar may need to navigate around walls to create an unobstructed path.\n3. Given the potential for rotating and not moving, we'll need to take care with directional inputs.\n4. Observing the adjacent cells:\n   - (10, 14): wall '%'\n   - (10, 16): empty '.'\n   - (9, 15): empty '.'\n   - (11, 15): empty '.'\n\nThe only viable movements from the current position are down to (9, 15) or up to (11, 15). Both positions are empty, so they will allow us to continue towards the goal without immediate hazards.\n\nGiven those points, I will **move down** to (9, 15) for the first action.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis allows me to maintain my progress towards the goal while considering the possible next steps without hitting walls or being damaged."
