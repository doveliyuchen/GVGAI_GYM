Moving up may create an opportunity to navigate past walls while keeping distance from the turret.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven that staying stationary could lead to an unfavorable bombardment from the turret, I'll choose to move up, as this might provide a safer pathway toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action positions the avatar away from the turret while engaging with a vertical route toward reaching the green door.
