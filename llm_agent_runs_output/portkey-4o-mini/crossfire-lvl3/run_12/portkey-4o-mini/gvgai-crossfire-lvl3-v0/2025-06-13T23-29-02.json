To maximize safety and progress towards the goal, I need to navigate cautiously, ensuring not to collide with bombs or get hit by turrets.\n\n1. **Initial Move:** Moving the avatar from (10, 12).\n2. The safest move appears to be up to (9, 12), which could potentially lead to a clearer pathway towards other columns and rows towards the goal while assessing the terrain ahead.\n\nGiven these evaluations, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\n\nI expect this move will keep the avatar safe while gathering more information about the surrounding traps and ice-bound layouts to plan further moves toward the goal."
