There are several walls (`%`), turrets (`$`), and bombs (`&`) in the surrounding areas that present danger.\n\n### Identifying Threats \nThe following elements are noteworthy:\n- There are `bomb turrets` present at (3, 28) and (4, 9) nearby, which potentially pose a threat with their bomb attacks.\n- Additionally, the area directly above the avatar looks safe for the moment, but immediate horizontal movement could lead to hazards from the turrets.\n\n### Applying Strategy\nConsidering the overall strategy:\n1. **Avoid Hazards**: I need to avoid any bombs launched by turrets.\n2. **Map Navigation**: Since I am currently at (9, 12), potential safe moves are upward toward (8, 12) but I must be cautious about where the `bombs` are located.\n3. **Wall Usage**: There are walls nearby that can provide cover.\n\n### Determining Next Action\nThe safest initial action is to assess the position directly above (8, 12) towards a potential pathway up the maze, given the goal is considerably up and left from the current position. Since the turret patterns may allow for some movement, the initial step will be to move upward to see if this opens new pathways without hitting hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move the avatar up to (8, 12), providing an opportunity to assess the new position for further movement while remaining wary of turret attacks."
