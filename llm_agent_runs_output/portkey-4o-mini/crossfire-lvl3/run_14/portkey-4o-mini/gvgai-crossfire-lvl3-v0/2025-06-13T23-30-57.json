The turrets at (4, 9) and (4, 10) can pose a significant threat if I get too close, especially since they can shoot bombs that will damage my avatar or push it back.\n\n### Strategy:\n- I need to move to (9, 16) but being next to the turret in row 4 would be risky in any direction near it.\n- Instead, let\u2019s assess going up toward row 8, as it appears to be a potentially clearer pathway.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n**Action: Move Up (4)** from (9, 15) to (8, 15).\n\nThis action will take me closer to the row where the goal is located, while also allowing me to assess the position of nearby hazards more clearly. I expect this will align with our strategic emphasis on map awareness and finding safer routes towards the goal. \n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n``` \n\nThis should allow for a clearer view of the surrounding cells on the next turn, helping plan the subsequent steps strategically."
