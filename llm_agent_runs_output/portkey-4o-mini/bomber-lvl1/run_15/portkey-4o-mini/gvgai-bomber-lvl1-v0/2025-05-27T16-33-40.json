The surrounding environment features various obstacles and sprites, including walls ('%'), water ('.'), and boxes ('@').\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The avatar is currently situated next to a wall on the left (col 3) and has a box directly above it (row 8, col 4).\n- There are obstacles and boxes obstructing a straight path to the goal.\n- There are rows of boxes (row 3 and row 8) and water that could potentially complicate movement toward the goal.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nThe avatar can use bombs to manipulate the environment, but the primary action at this point should be movement, as explosive actions may not yield immediate results or could be risky due to collateral damage to the surroundings.\n\nThe immediate goal is to navigate towards the goal. However, since movement to the left (col 3) is blocked by a wall and movement upward (to row 8) is blocked by a box, the viable options are to move right (col 5) or down (to row 10).\n\n### Strategy Application:\nTo follow through with the plan effectively:\n1. Moving right to (row 9, col 5) appears to be the best initial action as it will keep the avatar moving toward opening up further movement options and exploration of the nearby boxes that might yield useful items or paths.\n  \nThus, the chosen action based on the analysis is: \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nMoving right will potentially allow for further navigation towards clearing a path to the goal and gathering more information about the surrounding area, which is crucial based on the strategy suggestions."

This movement also positions closer to potential pathways due to the box arrangement.\n\n### Final Decision\nI will choose to take the **ACTION_UP** to potentially interact with the box at (7, 7). \n\n``` Action:5 ``` \n\nThis move aligns with the strategy of exploring the area and potentially manipulating the surroundings to eventually reach the goal."

The most immediate action will be to move upwards towards the bomb at (8, 4) to handle available resources.\n\n```Action: 5``` \n\nThis action should allow my avatar to rotate and engage with the environment strategically to utilize the available resources effectively.

It is also worth noticing the position of the bomb 'l' at (8, 4), which can be utilized for explosions and possible path formations.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nI should examine my surroundings first to see what obstacles I can deal with using the bomb.

Moving left toward (8, 6) is possible, but it only leads to water, whereas going down does not provide direct access to my goal yet.\n\nThus, after analyzing my surroundings and considering the next steps, my order of preference is to see if moving right (to (8, 8)) opens additional routes since there are bomb sprites close by that can be utilized.\n\nHence, I will:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action will attempt to move my avatar right, and I expect it to open up more strategic options in the next turn."

However, the adjacent sprites to the avatar are:\n- (8, 6) -> '.' (water)\n- (8, 8) -> '.' (water)\n- (7, 7) -> '@' (box)\n\nAt this point, a strategic step would be to move the avatar to either interact with the box or explore the surrounding water space. Since moving into a box is impossible and the avatar remains in the same position after a directional command could lead to a stall, swinging left doesn't yield actionable results for now.\n\nI'll then choose to interact with the box directly below the avatar to explore options further.
