Using the bomb can help clear boxes nearby and create space, which aligns with the strategy of resource management and clearing paths.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nUsing the bomb should allow us to interact with the boxes and create opportunities to navigate toward our goal strategically."

However, my position hasn\u2019t changed since the last turn, so I should explore different actions to create movement and advance towards the goal.\n\n### Next Best Action\nGiven that the immediate options are to move up (which will provide a new position to explore) or potentially interact with a box by going right, I will choose to move up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action will help ensure that I navigate a safe path towards either further exploration or anticipate future moves toward the goal and may expose me to clearer paths. I expect to find more suitable options in the next state as I progress upward."

Goal Position: (2, 15)\n3. Surrounding Elements: I'm surrounded by boxes '@' and space '.' on all sides, with a wall '%' to my north (row 8, col 6).\n\nGiven that I need to act differently than last time and considering my movement options:\n- Moving **LEFT** and **RIGHT** will keep me on the same row, whereas **UP** will likely hit a wall.\n- I can move **DOWN** to see if there\u2019s a more advantageous position or **UP** to explore alternatives towards goal navigation.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe right action to perform next would be to continue navigating through the boxes towards the goal. Since moving UP (to row 8, col 6) encounters a wall (row 8, col 6) directly above, I will try moving UP again to discover a path.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action should help assess the situation further or make a clear move towards the goal while seeing if my position allows further interactions with the surrounding elements."

This allows interaction with a box while also making progress toward the goal.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is:\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis move should help the avatar begin clearing boxes and progress towards the goal while adhering to the established strategy of avoiding hazards and exploring effectively."
