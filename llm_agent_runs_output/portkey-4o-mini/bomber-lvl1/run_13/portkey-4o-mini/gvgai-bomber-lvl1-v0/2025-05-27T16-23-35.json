I'm currently located at (row 7, col 3) as the avatar.\n\nBased on the map layout, my immediate options are:\n- I can move left to (row 7, col 2), which is free space ('.') but does not lead to any immediate benefit.\n- I can also move right to (row 7, col 4), another free space.\n- Moving up to (row 6, col 3) or down to (row 8, col 3) leads to free spaces as well.\n\nHowever, my strategy revolves around clearing obstacles (the boxes '@') and finding a path toward the goal (located at (row 2, col 15)). Observing the layout, it seems there are more boxes directly to my left in row 7 that could be destroyed, but I need bombs to interact with them effectively.\n\nSince no immediate advantage can be seen from moving right or left, I will proceed with moving up to check if there are bomb sprites nearby that can help in this situation. Therefore, I will choose to execute the action to move up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nThis action aligns with my strategy of exploring the environment efficiently for potential items (like bombs) that can aid in clearing the boxes and advancing toward the goal. My expectation is to uncover more options to either acquire bombs or find a clearer path elements for progressing through this level."
