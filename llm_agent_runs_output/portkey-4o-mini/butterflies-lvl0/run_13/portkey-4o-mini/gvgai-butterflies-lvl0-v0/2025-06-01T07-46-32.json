This is a valid action as it allows us to interact with a cocoon.\n2. **Right (to `(9, 13)`)**: This also moves to a cocoon. Another valid option.\n3. **Down (to `(10, 12)`)**: This hits a wall (`$`).\n4. **Up (to `(8, 12)`)**: This hits a wall (`$`).\n\n### Strategy Application\nGiven the goal to eliminate butterflies and the importance of managing cocoons, moving to either of the cocoon positions (left or right) is strategic. It allows potential future interactions either to eliminate butterflies or create clones.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the above analysis, we can move left to `(9, 11)` to utilize a cocoon, which may lead to a productive round of engagements with the butterflies in future turns.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to the cocoon is a strategic action for potential engagements with butterflies."

There are also cocoon sprites at (9, 11) and (9, 13), which are vital resources you must preserve.\n\n### Analysis of the Current State\n- **Cocoon Availability:** You have two cocoon sprites available, but they are several rows down from your current position.\n- **Butterfly Locations:** Multiple butterflies are scattered, with several directly to the left of the avatar, while others are positioned below.\n- **Walls:** The walls (denoted by '$') restrict movements; thus, strategic navigation around these elements is essential.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n1. **Immediate Danger:** You might be in a position to move toward the butterflies; however, approaching those that are in line of sight should be prioritized.\n2. **Goal:** Your primary objective is to eliminate butterflies, as this will increase your score while still ensuring you have available cocoons for victory.\n\n### Recommended Action\nBased on the analysis, you should first consider moving **LEFT** to (7, 8) to potentially engage with the butterfly at (7, 6) in the next turn. This action will keep you away from other obligations at the moment while allowing you to take out a butterfly that is visible.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left is a strategic choice to engage the closest butterflies and minimize any chance of being pinned in by walls. I expect this will allow access to a butterfly shortly, promoting further efficiency in your strategy."

There are cocoons on (9, 11) and (9, 13), providing a potential for resource management.\n\n### Strategy to Apply:\n- We need to move the avatar to eliminate butterflies efficiently.\n- Given that the butterflies are located at various positions, we'll want to prioritize moving towards a concentration of them for quick eliminations.\n\n### Assessing Possible Moves from (9, 20):\n- **ACTION_LEFT (8, 20):** Moves towards open space.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (10, 20):** Is invalid, as it would go into a wall.\n- **ACTION_UP (9, 19):** Moves towards open space.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (9, 21):** Moves towards open space.\n\nSince we have two valid moves that do not result in wall blocks, we should look towards a move that will allow access to more butterflies. \n\nTo attack butterflies efficiently, moving left to (8, 20) provides access along a line to move through later levels. This move also ensures that we can keep track of both the cocoons and the nearby butterflies in subsequent actions.\n\nThus, I will choose to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should lead me into a more favorable position to eliminate butterflies efficiently from the next turn while keeping cocoon options available."

My expectation is evaluating next potential moves while keeping an eye on butterfies and cocoons' positions."
