Since I am currently at (8, 13) and moving left will not lead me closer to any points, I will move upwards towards the nearer butterflies:\n\n- **Action**: ACTION_UP (2, 13) to (7, 13)\n\nThis will position me closer to the butterflies while remaining strategically aware of the cocoons that need careful management.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \nI expect my upward move will take me closer to one of the butterflies while keeping an eye on the placement of cocoons to ensure a managed strategy moving forward."

Instead, moving **UP** could provide further navigation options toward other butterflies.\n\n#### Evaluation of First Action Choice:\n1. Move UP to (row=6, col=6):\n   - This move does not interact with any butterflies or cocoon but may prepare for subsequent moves.\n\nBased on this analysis, my first action will be:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI've chosen to move Up, anticipating that this may allow more strategic options to collect butterflies in future turns while being cautious of the cocoon cluster below."

Since my immediate goal should prioritize collecting butterflies, it's beneficial to move toward their location.\n\nGiven my current position (7, 5), the closest butterfly is at (2, 2), so my best action is to navigate towards the 2nd row. The only feasible action from my current position is to move **up (to 6, 5)** as moving left, right or down does not lead towards the butterflies directly.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up brings me closer to a path leading to collect butterflies while also considering the management of the lifecycle between butterflies and cocoon interactions effectively."

However, due to walls blocking movement up and to the left or right, moving left or right doesn't help with reaching the butterflies.\n\nI can choose to move downward, but this won't help either since this action just leads to an empty space. Therefore, I will need to rotate first.\n\n### Determining the Best Move\nGiven that my avatar did not move, I will now move my avatar up towards row 8, col 7 to ultimately plot a path towards the butterflies.\n\nThe best immediate action will be:\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\nThis should shift my avatar upward. From there, I would need to evaluate for future moves to reach the butterflies. I expect this action aligns with the strategic approach of moving toward the butterflies while navigating the board effectively."

Although it may just be a placeholder action, it will shift my position and gather more clues.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves me toward an empty space, allowing me to further evaluate and strategize my next steps, such as getting closer to cocoon or nearby butterflies."

The surrounding area contains various sprites, including walls '$', empty spaces '.', butterflies '@', and cocoons '#'.\n\n1. **Avatar Position Evaluation**: The avatar's current position is relatively central, with potential paths to explore. However, we also need to prioritize moving toward the butterflies while avoiding interactions that might lead to a loss condition from the cocoons.\n\n2. **Butterflies and Cocoons**: There are butterflies at (row 2, col 14) and (row 3, col 14). There are also several cocoon clusters at (row 1, col 24), (row 2, col 24), (row 3, col 24), and more down the line. \n\n3. **Strategy Review**:\n   - **Prioritize Butterflies**: Collect butterflies to increase the count.\n   - **Manage Cocoons**: Avoid situations where cocoons proliferate beyond a threshold.\n   - **Movement Ability**: Review available actions.\n\n4. **Possible Actions**:\n   - Action LEFT (to col 15): This would move the avatar closer to the first butterfly at (2, 14).\n   - Action RIGHT (to col 17): This moves away from butterflies.\n   - Action UP: There are walls above, so movement is unlikely here.\n   - Action DOWN: Potential interactions with butterflies if there's space.\n\nSince moving LEFT directly engages the strategy of collecting butterflies, I will choose that action.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nBy choosing to move LEFT, I anticipate getting closer to the butterfly at (2, 14) and strategically advancing toward my objective while managing the cocoon situation."

The immediate surroundings include:\n\n- **Left (4, 14)**: A butterfly (@)\n- **Right (4, 16)**: An empty space (.)\n- **Down (5, 15)**: An empty space (.)\n- **Up (3, 15)**: A butterfly (@)\n\n### Objective and Strategy Recap\nYour primary objective is to increase the butterfly count while managing the cocoon count to avoid reaching the loss condition. Since there are butterflies nearby (both to the left and above), moving towards one of them is advantageous for scoring points.\n\n### Selected Action\nYou can choose:\n- **Left (ACTION_LEFT, 1)**: Move to (4, 14) and 'kill' the butterfly, increasing your score and butterfly count.\n- **Up (ACTION_UP, 4)**: Move to (3, 15) and also 'kill' the butterfly, resulting in a similar outcome.\n\nBoth actions are valid, but it may be strategic to act in a manner that gains immediate points without worrying about being blocked by walls or the cocoon counts at this moment, given there are no immediate cocoon threats.\n\n**Let's choose to move left to consume the butterfly:**\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\n### Feedback\nBy moving to the left towards the butterfly, I expect to increase the butterfly count effectively, which aligns directly with our strategy of collecting more butterflies while managing cocoon interactions afterward. This is a proactive move that should put us closer to the win condition."
