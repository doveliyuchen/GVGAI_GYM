    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game, we see that the key entities are positioned as follows:\n\n- Your avatar (`a`) is located at (row 9, col 16).\n- There are numerous butterflies (`@`) scattered throughout the map, particularly in rows 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n- There is at least one cocoon (`#`) at (row 1, col 16).\n- The rest of the space is primarily filled with walls (`$`) that limit your movement options.\n\nGiven the strategic approach where the objective is to gather butterflies quickly while managing the cocoons, I will focus on moving towards the nearest butterfly while ensuring I can address the cocoon if necessary.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1. Identify the nearest butterflies from the avatar's current position. The closest butterflies are found at (row 7, col 5), (row 7, col 6), and (row 9, col 9).\n2. As my avatar is currently at (row 9, col 16), moving left (ACTION_LEFT) to (row 9, col 15) seems to not be beneficial since it brings me closer to walls without encountering any butterflies.\n3. Moving down (ACTION_DOWN) only leads me towards more walls as rows 10 and further down are walled entirely.\n4. Moving up (ACTION_UP) to (row 8, col 16) brings me to a better position as I can continue navigating toward butterflies.\n\nGiven the considerations above, the most strategic move right now is to go **up** from my current position.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move will reposition me closer to potential butterfly encounters and will keep me away from walls while allowing further strategic options to secure butterflies effectively."

The avatar (`a`) is located at (8, 16), and there are multiple butterflies (`@`) nearby, which present good targets for accumulating points. \n\nGiven the previous strategic guidance, we must focus on accumulating butterflies and managing cocoons.\n\n### Observations:\n- There are several butterflies in the vicinity of the avatar:\n  - (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), etc.\n- The nearest butterfly is at (8, 6).\n\n### Plan:\nTo maximize the chance of hitting a butterfly next, I will move towards the left (to (8, 15)). This action will bring the avatar closer to the nearest butterfly located at (8, 6). \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of trying to engage with butterflies as effectively as possible.

    "content": "Given the current state, your avatar (represented as 'a') is located at `(row 8, col 17)`, and there are several butterflies (representing as '@') around your position. \n\n### Observations:\n1. **Adjacent Butterflies**: There are butterflies at `(row 8, col 6)`, `(row 8, col 7)`, `(row 8, col 12)`, `(row 8, col 13)`, and more in the nearby rows as well.\n2. **Cocoon**: There is a cocoon at `(row 1, col 16)`, which must be avoided to prevent losing the game.\n3. **Walls**: The walls are restricting the movement at the top and surrounding the area. No immediate walls are blocking your way to butterflies, but the borders restrict movement beyond row 0 and row 10.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Focus on butterflies**: Since the primary objective is to collect butterflies rapidly for points and avoid letting any cocoons survive, it is crucial to move toward the nearest butterflies while being cautious of the cocoon\u2019s location.\n2. **Avoid animals**: Currently, there are no visible animals around. Thus, movement towards butterflies is viable.\n3. **Plan next action**: Considering you can move left, right, up or down, it would be strategic to move towards one of the clusters of butterflies.\n\n### Next Movement:\nTo gather butterflies, you will move left to `(row 8, col 16)`, which brings you closer to the bunch of butterflies at `(row 8, col 12)` and `(row 8, col 13)`.\n\n```Action: 1```\nThis action aims to position the avatar closer to visible butterflies, aligning with the strategy."

    "content": "To determine the optimal action, let's analyze the current state. The avatar ('a') is located at (row=9, col=16), and we can see several butterflies ('@') present at various positions across the map, along with a cocoon ('#') at (row=1, col=16). \n\n### Key Points:\n- The objective is to maximize the number of butterflies earned while ensuring no cocoons are left alive.\n- The avatar needs to move towards the butterflies for effective engagement, avoiding animals where applicable.\n- The cocoon is a critical component for losing the game if it remains intact, thus it should be considered a lower priority since the avatar is not in immediate danger from it.\n\n### Action Options:\n1. **Moving Toward Butterflies**: The closest butterflies relative to the avatar's position are mainly located at:\n   - (row=8, col=7) \n   - (row=8, col=8)\n   - (row=8, col=9)\n   - (row=9, col=12)\n   - (row=9, col=13)\n   - (row=9, col=14)\n   \n2. **Current Restrictions**: We have walls ($) in many locations, which limit movement.
