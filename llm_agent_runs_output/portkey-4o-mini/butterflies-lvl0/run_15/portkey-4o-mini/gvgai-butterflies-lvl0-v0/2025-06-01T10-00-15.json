The action does not put the avatar at risk since there is no immediate butterfly threat.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down to the cocoon and positions it strategically to focus future actions on either destroying butterflies or managing the cocoon effectively.

Immediate engagement with these butterflies would be risky due to the distance and potential movement of the butterflies toward your position while you attack.\n3. **Cocoon Strategy**: The cocoon directly above your avatar allows for potential defensive play, as it can be used to manage butterfly creation if you're positioned favorably to avoid immediate attacks.\n\nConsidering that the last action was performed and the avatar did not change position, the next action should attempt to reposition safely while keeping the cocoon in mind for further interactions.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action:4 ```\n\n### Feedback:\nMoving **UP** will allow you to position your avatar directly adjacent to the cocoon, which gives strategic leverage to manage future butterfly interactions while also preparing for an offensive next turn.

However, the row has some butterflies and the walls below, meaning going down might not increase safety or threat control.\n- Up (Action 4 to (6, 2)): This would lead into an open space but does not directly confront the butterflies.\n- Left (Action 1 to (7, 1)): This would move towards a blank space, potentially reducing butterfly risk as there are no butterflies at that exact spot.\n- Right (Action 2 to (7, 3)): This direction is also blank, keeping a safe distance from nearby threats.\n\n### Optimal Choice\nConsidering that I need to avoid immediate threats and also look ahead to maximize point scoring by getting closer to cocoons and firing at butterflies strategically, I should take the action that maintains distance from butterflies while aiming to plan for future steps towards active spots.\n\nThe best action now is to move **LEFT** into an empty space.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left into the blank space keeps my avatar safe for now while allowing a better view of the surrounding threats for a follow-up move."

The immediate area surrounding your avatar includes several butterflies ('@') positioned at (row 7, col 18), (row 7, col 19), (row 7, col 22), (row 7, col 23), and more butterflies in the rows above (notably along row 6).\n\nHere's an analysis of the current situation based on the game mechanics and the strategy previously outlined:\n\n### Key Points to Consider:\n1. **Immediate Threat**: There are butterflies in your vicinity that can pose a threat to your avatar if approached without clearing them first.\n2. **Coconuts Management**: There are cocoon positions that may potentially create more butterflies if not managed carefully, but at this moment, you face an immediate threat from butterflies rather than cocoons.\n\n### Expected Actions:\nTo implement the strategy effectively:\n- You should prioritize evading the butterflies or engaging sensible actions that reduce their numbers.\n- Since there's no movement in the last action recorded, we need to determine effective directional action to promote advantageous movement while ensuring safety.\n\n### Suggested Move:\nGiven that your avatar doesn't change position, it may indicate a need to rotate before moving. An appropriate action may be to step in a way that first rotates toward a butterfly before encaging it.\n\nThus, to reposition appropriately while maintaining a strategic viewpoint, I recommend:\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis means moving downwards a step. The aim is to reposition your avatar to look to effectively either access the area below where you've fewer obstacles and plan future actions correctly. Expect to assess the further immediate surge of butterflies and decrease their population while avoiding their lines of attack in the next rounds."

This would also allow potential control over the butterfly population in subsequent moves.\n\nThus, the selected action is:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left should prepare for an immediate response to create a strategic advantage with the cocoon, which could influence butterfly interactions on the next turn."

Since the objective is to eliminate butterflies while avoiding getting 'killed' by them, I need to take an action that either moves the avatar out of the immediate danger zone or targets one of the butterflies strategically.\n- Since I am at position (7, 1), the butterflies near (7, 8) and (8, 5) pose a significant threat if I do not adjust my position.\n\n### Available Actions\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: This would move the avatar to (7, 0), which is a wall ($). Hence, it's not possible.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Moves to (7, 2), which is an empty space (.).\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Moves to (8, 1), which is also an empty space (.).\n4. **ACTION_UP (4)**: Moves to (6, 1), which is an empty space (.).\n\n### Action Decision\nConsidering the available actions:\n- **Moving Right (to (7, 2))**: This keeps me to the same vertical level but gets closer to the butterflies.\n- **Moving Down (to (8, 1))**: Stays in the same column but potentially opens up paths and keeps me away from the dangerous butterflies above.\n- **Moving Up (to (6, 1))**: This also opens up more spaces while avoiding immediate danger from butterflies below.\n\nGiven that moving **Down** to (8, 1) would keep me in an empty space while positioning me below the immediate threat of butterflies directly next to (7, 1), this seems like the best initial move to avoid collision, open space exploration, and opportunity to navigate strategically later on.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down to (8, 1), which is safe and allows for further maneuvering in the subsequent turns.

Moving **LEFT** to (9, 2) - will not likely help as it goes into more empty space without directly impacting butterfly population.\n2. Moving **RIGHT** to (9, 4) \u2013 this leads to a neutral space avoiding collision.\n3. Moving **DOWN** to (10, 3) \u2013 also leads into walls with no immediate interaction.\n4.

Moving directly into a butterfly would endanger my avatar.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best action would be to move **down** to (7, 1) where the cocoon is located.

By moving down, the avatar can interact with the cocoon, which is strategically important because it can potentially convert into a butterfly if left unchecked.\n\n### Chosen Action\nWe must choose the action that will progress towards the objective of managing the butterfly population, and as such, I will move down to the position of the cocoon.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows interaction with the cocoon while continuing to mitigate the butterfly threat by managing its spawn. However, I will need to remain vigilant after this action to respond appropriately to any new butterflies generated."

The immediate surroundings should be assessed for any potential movement or threats.\n2. **Threat Level**: There are butterflies in positions (7, 21), (7, 22), (7, 23), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 14), (8, 18), (8, 19), (9, 9), and more that could pose a risk if the avatar remains static or moves inadequately.\n3. **Movement**: The points indicate a need for strategic movement. Avoid becoming trapped or surrounded by butterflies.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nSince the avatar cannot remain idle and must evade potential threats while possibly preparing to capture butterflies, I will take the action of moving left to (7, 0). This position is within the wall boundary which ensures protection from butterfly collision.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to reposition the avatar safely further left, aligning with the strategy of avoiding immediate threats and managing movement effectively. Moving left may open opportunities for future actions without putting the avatar in danger from the surrounding butterflies."
