I should proceed to either eliminate the nearby butterflies or convert cocoons while being mindful of avoiding contact with butterflies. \n\nSince the avatar is currently stationary, I need to take a meaningful action. Moving towards the butterflies currently seems like the best choice as it directly contributes to the objective of eliminating them and gaining points.\n\n### Action Decision\nI'll move to the right (ACTION_RIGHT) towards the butterfly at (3, 10). This action not only brings me closer to a butterfly but also keeps me clear of any immediate threats from other butterflies.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nFeedback: I expect this action will bring me adjacent to a butterfly, allowing me to eliminate it in the next turn while moving towards my goal of eliminating all butterflies."

The next surrounding rows (8 and 6) appear to be filled with spaces, thus surrounding the environment needs to be assessed. \n\n### Avatar Position Analysis:\nGiven that the last position was (7, 5), I need to decide the next action to explore further.\n \n- **Down (Action: 3): (8,5)** - There are no butterflies or cocoons directly below, meaning safety is ensured.\n- **Up (Action: 4): (6,5)** - This area requires analyzing for contact with butterflies; however, directly above at (6,5) is safe.\n- **Left (Action: 1): (7,4)** - This area is also free of any threats.\n- **Right (Action: 2): (7,6)** - Similarly, this area has no immediate threats as well.\n\nGrass is a tactical choice to analyze the overall plan into account. To get the avatar to a position where it can interact with the butterflies, I will move **Down**, since there are no immediate threats and we can aim to further access the bottom rows where more butterflies are present for potential interaction in later turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n**Feedback:** Moving down will allow the avatar to access the next row with safety and create an opportunity to interact with butterflies in subsequent moves."
