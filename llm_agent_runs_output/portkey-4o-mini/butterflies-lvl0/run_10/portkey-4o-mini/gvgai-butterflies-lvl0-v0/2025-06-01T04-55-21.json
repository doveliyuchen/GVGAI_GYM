However, this does not help in engaging Butterflies.\n4. **Moving Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: This would take me to (6, 12), which is still clear (there's an absence of obstacles or Butterflies).\n\nConsidering my position is vital and to better position myself without losing movement, I choose to **move up** to (5, 11).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up will allow me to reassess the surrounding area, keeping my strategies open to engage with Butterflies while avoiding risk."

The immediate surroundings have a butterfly at (5, 21), too close for comfort if I move in that direction.\n\n3. **Navigate the Map**: The optimal move that minimizes risk while also allowing us to shift position without rotating towards a Butterfly would be to move to the left (ACTION_LEFT).
