The avatar can attempt to move left or down, but moving left (6, 13) positions you nearer to possibly accessing the upper fields where butterflies are located.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will help explore a space and hopefully yield a better strategic position for future moves toward the butterflies while avoiding walls.
