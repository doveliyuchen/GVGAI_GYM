    "content": "To determine the next action, I'll analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map and rules.\n\n### Current Game State Overview:\n- The avatar's position (indicated by 'a') is not explicitly stated in the map. However, based on the context of the game, it seems like your avatar is positioned at the reference points of rows and goal locations shown as '#'.\n- The goal is located at several positions in the maze but notably appears in row 1, column 1 and potentially at other rows. \n- There are camels located around the area, specifically in rows 1 and 2, column 46, which may block the path toward the goal.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Actions:\n1. **Direction of Movement**: The priority is to navigate towards a goal ('#') while avoiding interaction with any camels ('&', '@').\n2. **Walls ('f')**: The map is surrounded by walls preventing straightforward movement in certain directions.\n3. **Current Position**: Depending on your previously stated position, if it didn't change, we would need to rotate towards a direction first to facilitate movement.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince your avatar's position or last action isn't explicitly stated, I'll proceed to attempt moving **LEFT** as a starting action if the current position allows it (to potentially get closer to a goal on the left or avoid a camel).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to test if moving left allows for a better pathway to goals, and I expect to see if the avatar can either move closer to a goal or if it needs to adjust its next action due to the wall."

    "content": "To begin, we must first identify the current state of the game, particularly the position of the avatar and the goal, along with any potential obstacles (walls) and camels nearby. \n\nBased on the current state, the player's avatar is represented as \"a\". The map denotes:\n- The player's avatar position: (7, 2) \n- The goal position marked with \"#\": Multiple goals located at (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1).\n- The random camels represented as \"&\": A random camel is found at (1, 46), (2, 46), (7, 43), (7, 46).\n\nGiven this information, the strategic objective is to navigate towards the goal while avoiding camels. Considering the camels' apparent positions and accounting for walls, we determine the avatar's possible actions.\n\nAnalyzing the last action executed, since the avatar's position may remain static, we should consider the next move based on potential direction:\n- Moving UP (ACTION_UP) will move the avatar to (6, 2), which appears to provide a clear path since it avoids both walls and camels.\n\nThus, I will undertake the action to move up.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this movement to bring me closer to a goal without immediate threat from the camels, following the strategy of prioritizing the clear path to the objective."
