Observe camel movement and pathfinding.\n2. Utilize backtracking and timing to bypass crowded sections.\n3. Aim to navigate towards open spaces and the goal while avoiding obstacles dynamically.\n\n### Current Configuration \nFrom what I can infer, the action to be taken depends on ensuring the avatar does not engage in a nil action. If the previous action resulted in a rotation without movement, I will need to choose an alternative action that ensures relocation toward the goal.\n\nAfter reviewing the layout, it is beneficial to move UP or LEFT as it keeps alignment with potentially more open routes and brings me closer to the goal while avoiding cluttered areas.\n\nGiven that the expected action for forward movement should avoid walls while navigating effectively, I will opt for moving **UP** to `(6, 1)` and attempt to gain a direct pathway or strategic advantage close to the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should move my avatar closer to where the goals are located while optimizing for safety away from camels that might approach from the sides.

I need to avoid these as they block movement.\n2. **Goals ('#')**: There are several goal positions listed in the map: rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have goals.

My positioning relative to them is crucial. In the state presented, in rows 3, 4, and 5, I see potential hazards with camels indicated by symbols ('&').\n\n### Decision Making:\n- My primary goal, according to the rules, is to reach the green door (\"#\") without allowing any camels to reach it first.\n- It's important not to make a move that would lead to my position being blocked.\n\nSince I cannot see my current position and I have to act based on strategy, I will assume a hypothetical position starting below the rows mentioned where goals are located, potentially around row 6 or lower.\n\n### Suggested Action:\n- If I\u2019m positioned near row 6 or lower, I should attempt to navigate upwards towards the goal in row 1. Given that the immediate vicinity near the possible avatar position does not seem restricted, the action of moving up is logical.\n\nThus, I will execute:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\n**Feedback**: I expect this move will put me closer to the goal without hitting any walls, while keeping aware of any camels that may be approaching from below.

Your next action should facilitate either movement towards the goal or repositioning to avoid being blocked or trapped by the camels.\n\n### Next Steps\nEvaluate your own avatar location. If your avatar is currently positioned nearby the goal (like (2,1)), moving UP (action 1) would be logical to reach the goal.\n\nIf your avatar is located somewhere with fewer paths available and trapped or blocked by camels, repositioning may be necessary (like moving sideways or downward).\n\nPlease provide the exact location of your avatar for a more informed strategy or state his presence.

Since I haven't been provided my exact starting position, I'll analyze the available paths to reach the goal while avoiding camels and walls.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The `#` goal appears on rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 in column 1.\n- Moving vertically is blocked by walls, the avatar can only move horizontally or confirm its path before deciding to make the next move.\n- There are camels (`&`, `@`, `*`, and others) between the avatar and the goal, so moving closer to the goal needs careful consideration.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The first move should be to check for an open path without directly encountering walls or camels. \n- Given the upper walls and the goal, I will check movement directionally based on the goal's column.\n\nStarting at row 0, I will check the columns and determine an action that does not lead to a direct loss:\n\n1. **Moving Down to row 1 in column 1** where the goal (`#`) is located should be prioritized if possible.\n2. If obstacles block this movement, check the horizontal movements.\n\n### Action:\nSince I can't determine an exact action without knowing my avatar's current position, I will assume I am at (row 0, col 1) and will aim to move right to reach position (row 0, col 2) to further assess my path upwards since there is only a wall below in row 1.\n\nThus, my action would be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis move is expected to help avoid any immediate conflicts and provide more space to assess further actions toward the goal without directly interacting with camels. I anticipate that this aligns with the strategy to avoid direct confrontation by rotating and then confirming my position."

Therefore, the player can reach the goal in the next move.\n\nI will take the action to move down to (2, 1) to reach the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to succeed in reaching the goal, thus winning the round."

However, there is a green door (the goal '#') located at several positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1); while various camels ('@', '%', '&', '*', and so on) occupy other positions.\n\nFrom the map layout, it appears there are pathways available, particularly in the rows where the goals are located. The closest goal from my position appears to be (1,1). \n\nSince I am instructed to move and surrounding conditions indicate that camels are approaching the goals at various speeds, my focus should be on navigating towards one of these goals while avoiding the camels, especially the slow camels to mitigate risk.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Actions\n- The action must direct movement towards the goal while avoiding walls ('f').\n- The goal is at (1,1), and since I am looking to reach the goal before a camel does, the first step is to check for open paths.\n\nGiven the strategic nature of the game and potential areas of remaining stationary causing a need for a new action, I will return to action 'UP', as there may be an interpretation of my position that hasn't merged back from the last state. Moreover, while attempting that direction, I will also observe where potential camels are.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis is an upward movement attempt towards the goal, aiming to reach (1,1). I expect my avatar to effectively progress toward the goal, while simultaneously avoiding the camels present in the area."

I expect to see if I can get a clearer path without being blocked by walls or encountering camels."
