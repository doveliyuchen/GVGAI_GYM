Importantly, we need to verify whether there are any necessary resources I can collect or actions I can take to move toward obtaining the exit.\n\nI will first check movement options based on the current surrounding area. The avatar can move:\n\n- LEFT (to (7, 19)) - Valid as there\u2019s a solid walkable path.\n- RIGHT (to (7, 21)) - Valid but non-productive (only a wall).\n- DOWN (to (8, 20)) - Valid movement (ground is traversable).\n- UP (to (6, 20)) - Valid movement but near smoke (might be risky).\n\nSince I noticed that moving UP would place my avatar near a smoke obstacle, I'll avoid that for now. The next optimal action would be to move DOWN to (8, 20), a valid ground space that would allow further exploration while minimizing risk.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action sets my avatar in a safer space, allowing for future moves towards the exit while also exploring the layout around the box at (5, 22) after moving down."
