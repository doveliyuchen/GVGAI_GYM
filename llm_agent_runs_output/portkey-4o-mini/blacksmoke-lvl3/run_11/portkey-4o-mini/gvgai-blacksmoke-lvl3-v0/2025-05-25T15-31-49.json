To ensure survival and further progress, we should consider using the smoke for strategic movement.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe avatar can rotate and potentially move in four directions, but due to the presence of walls, careful analysis is required:\n\n1. **Moving Up (6, 11) to (5, 11)**: This is possible and moves the avatar into smoke (protective).\n2. **Moving Down (6, 11) to (7, 11)**: Blocked by wall.\n3. **Moving Left (6, 11) to (6, 10)**: This moves into another smoke.\n4. **Moving Right (6, 11) to (6, 12)**: This also moves into smoke.\n\nGiven that the movement up or left will add some strategic safety (as well as potential benefit of collecting smoke points), I\u2019ll choose to move up.\n\n### Decision\nI will execute the \"UP\" action:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis should move the avatar to (5, 11) where it can remain safe amongst the smoke and prepare for the next moves strategically while avoiding immediate threats."
