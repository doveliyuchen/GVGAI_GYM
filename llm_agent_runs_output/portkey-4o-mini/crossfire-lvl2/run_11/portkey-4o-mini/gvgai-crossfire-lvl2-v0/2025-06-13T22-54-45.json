The only immediate course of action is to assess movements to the left or right.\n\nGiven that the avatar had a movement action previously (although we do not know the exact context leading to the current state), let's proceed to move the avatar to the **left** (row 13, col 25). This will let us explore the area further while keeping our occupied row.\n\nPreparing to move left now:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis move should provide a clearer view of the path ahead since it's crucial to leverage walls for protecting from hazards and planning future moves.

I must also consider the layout of the walls as I navigate.\n\n### Given strategic guidelines from the previous advice:\n- **Planning Movements**: Before moving, I must consider the danger posed by the turrets and the bomb firing cooldown. The turrets have a 3-second cooldown for firing bombs.\n- **Adapt and Observe**: I must remember that moving in a way that keeps me hidden behind walls or makes a coordinated attempt to navigate between firing shots is essential.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- **Move Left** (to (13, 24)): This seems to be safe since there are no hazards.\n- **Move Right** (to (13, 26)): This also leads me forward, but I must check for any immediate danger from the bomb turret on row 7.\n- **Move Up** (to (12, 25)): This moves me vertically, but puts me into a row with walls further up, possibly blocking my path.\n- **Move Down** (to (14, 25)): This will put me into the next row below, which appears to be mostly walls.\n\nGiven the immediate threats around (especially with bombs from the turrets), I believe my safest action is to move left, allowing me to explore without directly engaging the turrets and avoiding immediate interaction with bombs.\n\n### Deciding on Action:\nI will choose to **move LEFT** to position myself more safely and observe the pattern of the turrets from a different angle. \n\n```Action: 1``` \n\nThis left move should keep me safe from immediate bomb threats while allowing me to figure out my next steps."

The avatar must avoid the turrets and their projectiles while making progress toward the goal.\n\n### Avatar's Position:\n- The avatar can't move left (to (13, 21)) or right (to (13, 23)) because both cells contain walls.\n- Moving down (to (14, 22)) is not possible due to a wall.\n- Moving up (to (12, 22)) is possible and safe because it leads to an empty cell (.) and does not put the avatar in immediate danger.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nGiven that the only viable movement that doesn't result in a collision and could potentially lead to further options would be to move up. \n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up allows the avatar to explore more cells while safely avoiding any turrets and is aligned with the strategy to explore the map and find paths towards the goal."

    "content": "The current state of the game shows that your avatar (represented by 'a') is located at (12, 22). The immediate surroundings include a wall to the left (12, 21) and an open area to the right (12, 23). The goal is located at (1, 26), and there are various obstacles, including turrets and bombs, throughout the map.\n\nGiven your current position, your aim should be to navigate safely towards the goal while avoiding being hit by turrets or bombs. The next action should either rotate and move or move to a different path that does not lead to immediate danger.\n\nSince you can't move left due to the wall, your best options are to either move right to (12, 23) or up towards (11, 22).\n\nI will choose to move right to see if there is a safe path available in that direction. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nI expect that moving right will keep me safe from nearby hazards, possibly allowing me to navigate better towards the goal in subsequent turns."

Its immediate surrounding consists of walls (%) at (12, 22) and (12, 24) as well as more walls and obstacles below and above. The goal '#' is located at (1, 26). \n\nCurrently, there are multiple turrets '@' in proximity, notably along the row 4 and row 3 and wall barriers are scattered around the map. Since most of the action involves avoiding turrets and their bomb firings we should prioritize movement that increases distance from turrets and keeps to the safe path towards the goal.\n\nGiven the character's current position:\n- Up (11, 23), Down (13, 23), Left (12, 22), and Right (12, 24) all lead to places either blocked by walls or near turrets.\n\nTo make progress, I evaluate the action of moving UP (to 11, 23) which can open the path toward potentially navigating to the right later on.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action of moving UP is part of a cautious strategy to find a safer route towards the goal while currently not being hit or blocked by turrets."

    "content": "To determine the next action for the avatar, we need to analyze the game state based on the provided layout and the strategies stated earlier.\n\n### Current Position:\nThe avatar ('a') is located at row 11, column 23.\n\n### Surroundings of the Avatar:\n- Up (row 10, col 23): a wall ('%')\n- Down (row 12, col 23): an empty space ('.')\n- Left (row 11, col 22): an empty space ('.')\n- Right (row 11, col 24): an empty space ('.')\n\n### Available Actions:\n- Up (move to row 10, col 23): This is a wall, so movement isn't possible.\n- Down (move to row 12, col 23): This is clear, so movement is possible.\n- Left (move to row 11, col 22): This is also clear, so movement is possible.\n- Right (move to row 11, col 24): This is clear too, allowing movement.\n\n### Analysis:\nSince all options except moving up are available, I want to consider what each direction would accomplish. The goal (#) is at (row 1, col 26), which is directly reachable if we can navigate safely around the turrets and avoid any bombs. However, the path upward is obstructed, indicating that downward, left, or right movements will need strategic planning for future turns.\n\nGiven that movement patterns depend on the surrounding threats (bombs and turrets):\n1. Moving Down (to row 12, col 23) could allow further exploration towards the left or right of this row.\n2. Moving Left (to row 11, col 22) is a good exploratory choice, but it may limit immediate forward movement.\n3. Moving Right (to row 11, col 24) also appears to open further exploration towards the right side.\n\nTo follow the strategy of exploring and avoiding potential threats (bombs from turrets), I will proceed with moving Down first, as it opens up new spaces without moving into open turrets territory directly.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \nMoving down to row 12 should allow additional options for movement on the next turn, aligning with a cautious exploration strategy."
