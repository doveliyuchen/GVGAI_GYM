    "content": "To determine the best action in the current state, let's analyze the relevant information:\n\n1. **Current Avatar Position:** The avatar ('a') is located at (13, 25).\n2. **Other Entities Nearby:**\n   - The surrounding cells at (12, 25), (14, 25), (13, 24), and (13, 26) are checked.\n   - (13, 24) is empty ('.'), (13, 26) is empty ('.'), (12, 25) is empty ('.'), and (14, 25) is also empty ('.').\n3. **Goals:**\n   - The nearest goal is '#', located at (2, 26). The objective is to navigate through the maze while avoiding any bombs and turrets.\n\n### Available Actions:\nWe can choose movements (left, right, up, down) from the current position:\n\n- **LEFT (2, 25)**: The resulting position would be (13, 24) which is empty and safe.\n- **RIGHT (2, 25)**: The resulting position would be (13, 26) which is also empty and safe.\n- **UP (12, 25)**: The resulting position would be (12, 25) which is empty and safe.\n- **DOWN (14, 25)**: The resulting position would be (14, 25) which is empty and safe.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nAccording to the strategy, navigation should be cautious, aiming to maintain distance from turrets and moving efficiently toward the goal. Moving up to (12, 25) allows access to the upper portion of the map where there are pathways leading towards the goal. Additionally, moving downwards or left/right maintains proximity to multiple empty cells for maneuverability while avoiding direct confrontations with possible bomb areas.\n\n### Action Conclusion:\nConsidering all factors for safety, space to move, and progression toward the goal, the optimal action would be to move **UP**.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to be strategic as it takes us through a safe area with further movement options while progressing toward the goal."

    "content": "The avatar ('a') is currently positioned at (13, 25). The objective is to reach the goal ('#') located at (2, 26), while avoiding turrets ($) and bombs (&).\n\nIn analyzing the surroundings:\n\n- **Walls (%)** block certain movements.\n- **Bombs (&)** will pose a threat if the avatar moves into their range or toward the turrets that may shoot at them.\n- **Turrets ($)** are strategically located, indicating that I need to navigate carefully.\n\nGiven the current position, moving towards the goal is the priority, while avoiding the potential dangers from the surrounding bombs and turrets. \n\nHowever, the immediate next spaces to the left (13, 24), right (13, 26), down (14, 25), and up (12, 25) will help determine the safest actions.\n\n- **(13, 24)** left: empty (.)\n- **(13, 26)** right: empty (.)\n- **(14, 25)** down: wall (%)\n- **(12, 25)** up: empty (.)\n\nFrom this analysis, moving left to (13, 24) or right to (13, 26) both appear as valid options that will not cause any collision and will keep me away from the immediate threat of bombs. Moving up to (12, 25) is also safe since it is empty, but thus continues my horizontal navigation.\n\nTo maintain a strategic position toward the goal, I will choose to move left, as it may help in exploring other routes while ensuring safety.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action keeps me safe while allowing me to explore further routes towards the goal without moving directly into any danger. I expect to assess further moves based on the new position and surroundings."
