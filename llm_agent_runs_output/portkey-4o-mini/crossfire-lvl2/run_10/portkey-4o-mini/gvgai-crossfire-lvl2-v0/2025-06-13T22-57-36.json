Additionally, this action will allow exploration of new rows where there may be fewer obstacles and potential movement towards the goal.\n\nGiven that the preferred direction is down and that it allows for progress, the action taken will be:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move will transition the avatar down to (11, 21), hopefully opening up more pathways toward the goal."

The only viable movement options are upward since left and down are blocked by walls, and moving right (to (11, 22)) would be safe as there is no immediate danger of bombs or turrets in that direction.\n\nGiven these factors and the emphasis on navigating towards the goal (#) which is at (1, 26), moving upward is a safe action that allows the avatar to relocate without posing an immediate threat from any nearby turrets or bombs.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up will help navigate safely and open more potential paths towards the goal.
