The goal ('#') is located at row 1, column 26, and there are several walls ('%') surrounding the player. The primary concern here is to navigate through the maze while avoiding turrets and bombs, especially given that there are multiple bomb turrets in the vicinity that can cause damage.\n\nTo determine the next best move, I will assess the possible actions:\n- **Moving Left (2,26):** This would take the avatar toward the goal, but the path may also expose the player to potential bombardment if any turrets are in that line.\n- **Moving Right (2,28):** This would lead closer to open space but take the player further from the goal.\n- **Moving Up (1,27):** This action is blocked by a wall.\n- **Moving Down (3,27):** This also leads to an open area without immediate threats.\n\nNavigating toward the goal (row 1, col 26) is paramount, so the safest action that moves towards it while considering the current position and layout is to move left to (row 12, column 26), where the player can start heading toward the goal.\n\nI will proceed with the action of moving left, to get closer to the goal while assessing the potential threats. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is significant as it moves me toward the direction of the goal while minimizing interactions with turrets and bombs. I expect to see progress toward the goal and reassess my surroundings in the next move."
