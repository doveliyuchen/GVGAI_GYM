As the avatar's position has not changed since the last state (it's still at (10, 7)), I should plan an action that will lead to movement.\n\nThe potential next actions are:\n1. Move left to (10, 6): `.` (Clear space)\n2. Move right to (10, 8): `&` (Dirt, no obstruction)\n3. Move up to (9, 7): `.` (Clear space)\n4. Move down to (11, 7): `&` (Dirt, no obstruction)\n\nAll possible moves are valid, but given my current objective of exploring and possibly finding diamonds or clearer routes, moving up to (9, 7) might be a good option since it keeps the same vertical dimension while also allowing further movement options in subsequent turns.\n\nThus, I'll proceed with moving up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action should allow me to scout the area further without immediate risk, aligning with my strategy of exploration and resource management."
