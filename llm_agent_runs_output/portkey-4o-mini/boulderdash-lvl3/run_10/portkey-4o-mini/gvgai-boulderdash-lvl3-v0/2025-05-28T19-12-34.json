Since I have the sword, I can either defeat it or avoid it altogether if necessary.\n2. **Collecting Diamonds**: There are diamonds nearby (like those at (3, 5) and (4, 1)). I need to collect them cautiously to maintain the goal of having 8 or fewer diamonds by the exit.\n3. **Movement**: As my avatar's position is key, any movement must be carefully planned to avoid changes that increase danger.\n\n### Next Action Decision:\nI will take an action that helps reset or analyze the threat, allowing me to plan a safe route away from the crab towards the diamonds while avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\nI will take the action to **move left**:\n``` \nAction:2\n```\nThis movement won't put me immediately in danger and helps gather more information for my next move, aligning with the strategy to observe enemy patterns and maximize resource management.

Since the current surroundings are empty spaces (and thus safe) in the immediate adjacent cells, we can choose a movement action.\n2.
