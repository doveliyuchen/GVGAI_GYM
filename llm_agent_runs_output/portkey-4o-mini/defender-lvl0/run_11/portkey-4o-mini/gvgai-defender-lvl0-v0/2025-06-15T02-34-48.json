The available supplies '&' can help replenish my bullets and the bombs (represented as 'b') can also assist in clearing groups.\n3. **City Defense**: Losing the city (if it takes damage) is a concern, so engaging with the aliens quickly is essential.\n\nGiven the game's mechanics, my avatar has not moved recently, which calls for a strategic approach focusing on either engaging the threat or maneuvering for a better tactical position.\n\nI am in line with the 'aliens' and there is no wall blocking my shot. Thus, I will choose to engage the enemies directly to the west with an action to move left.\n\nAction: `ACTION_LEFT`\n\nThis action positions me to attack the aliens nearby and prevents me from being stationary, facilitating my offensive strategy effectively.

Protecting this area is crucial.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation\n- **Resource Management**: It's vital to collect more bullets from supplies to ensure a sustained offensive against aliens without running out of ammo.\n- **Target Prioritization**: Focusing on the nearest aliens will minimize the threat to the city.\n- **Positioning**: Avoiding collisions with walls and remaining in a tactical position to evade damage is critical.\n\n### Available Actions:\nGiven the above considerations, I need to select an action. If the avatar doesn't seem to have moved recently, a directional action should be performed. If we assume no movement occurred previously, the priority will be to engage with the nearest alien on the map, which is located at (2, 0). \n\nTherefore, my planned action is to move my avatar **downward** to possibly prepare an attack on the nearby alien.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows me to reposition towards the nearest alien for an effective attack while maintaining distance from the city and walls, aligning with my defensive strategy."

You'll need to start gathering resources while engaging enemies to prevent the city from being attacked.\n\nGiven that your position hasn't changed (which requires an action that effectively moves your avatar), we need to determine a course of action that helps progress. You could engage the aliens or move toward a resource.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- Moving left (2): This will not provide movement based on your position's constraints and existing threats.\n- Moving right (3): A step towards the city but does not help engage the threat.\n- Moving up (5): There are multiple aliens nearby that could initiate attacks.\n- Moving down (4): This could provide you an opportunity to move towards some resources.\n\nGiven that there are aliens in the vicinity, and considering the importance of avoiding unnecessary threats while still being strategic with movement, my suggestion would be to:\n\n```Action: 4```\n\nThis action attempts to move down one space, potentially providing a clear line to resources or avoiding direct confrontation with enemies.
