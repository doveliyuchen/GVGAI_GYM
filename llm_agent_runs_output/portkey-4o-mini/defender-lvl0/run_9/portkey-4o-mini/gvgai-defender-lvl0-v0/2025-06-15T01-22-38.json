Since the avatar hasn't moved yet, we need to decide whether to engage the alien or collect resources. \n2. Engaging the alien is essential, but we also need to ensure we have enough bullets. Therefore, collecting ammo first could be a prudent move.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- The worst-case scenario would be to simply wait, leading to an eventual loss due to alien engagement. Hence, we should collect a nearby supply or reposition the avatar.\n- Moving towards the ammunition supply at (0, 4) may aid in replenishing bullets while maintaining the city's safety.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar to the left (if the avatar was facing right or stationed at position (3, 1), this shift will initiate movement).

The closest aliens are located directly upward within the (2, 2) and (2, 3) region.\n\nGiven the strategic emphasis on eliminating immediate threats, the avatar should take action to move up as follows:\n\n``` \nAction: 5\n```\n\nThis action allows the avatar to reposition directly at (11, 2) in line with the available aliens and therefore allows for prioritization of offensive measures.
