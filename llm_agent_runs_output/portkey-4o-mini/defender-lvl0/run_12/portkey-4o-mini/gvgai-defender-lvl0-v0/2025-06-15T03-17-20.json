The city is represented by \u2018@\u2019, and my main objective is to defend it while managing ammunition effectively.\n\n**Determining the Avatar's Last Known Position:**\n- I will assume the last known position for my avatar based on previous context. If I'm supposed to follow the gameplay flow logically, I would approach the nearest supply and ensure to destroy nearby aliens for better ammo management while preventing damage to the city. \n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Verify my position.\n2. If I\u2019m close enough to supplies, I may want to move toward them to collect.\n3. If enemies are nearby, I need to focus on eliminating them.\n\nBased on deduction, if I see the closest supply (`p`) character is at (4, 4), I would aim to move towards that. \n\n### Decision:\nGiven I have not changed position from the last known avatar position based on context, my current action plan is to move to the supply at (4, 4) where the `p` is located. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThe action is to move LEFT towards my target supply.
