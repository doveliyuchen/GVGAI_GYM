Controlling these aliens should be a priority as their attacks will decrease the score.\n  \n2. **Consider Resource Collection:** The portals marked as `&` indicate places where ammo can be collected, which is also important to ensure that the avatar can continue to defend effectively.\n\n3. **Current Objective:** Given the current state of the map and the positioning of threats, an effective action could be to focus on using any resources (bullets) against the immediate alien threats, while also potentially moving toward collecting more ammo.\n\n### Action Selection:\nGiven these observations, the logical first action would be to try to engage the aliens positioned below. I will choose the following action:\n\n``` Action: ACTION_USE ```\nThis action aims to utilize bullets against the nearby threats while ensuring that the resources are actively being used to reduce the immediate risk to the city.
