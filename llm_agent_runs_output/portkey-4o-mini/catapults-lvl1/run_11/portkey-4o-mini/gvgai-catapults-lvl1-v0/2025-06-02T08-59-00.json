The adjacent tiles include water to the east (1, 2), which must be avoided, and a moving floor (1, 7) further along on that row.\n2. **Goal Position**: There are multiple goal sprites on the map, specifically on (14, 7) and (14, 14). Navigating towards any of them will be essential for winning.\n3. **Obstacles**: There are many walls ('*') surrounding the avatar, but moving in the direction of cells with (0), (1), or (2) could be possible strategies depending on current orientation.\n4. **Safety**: Ensuring the avatar's safety is critical, as moving positions into water or getting crushed by a wall should be avoided at all costs.\n\nSince the last state had the avatar stationary and there was no action taken, a careful approach is necessary.\n\nLet's move **UP (ACTION_UP)** to see if that opens further options toward navigating and potentially rearranging positions safely without immediate threats:\n\n```Action: 4```\n\nMoving up allows for analysis of potential future paths and avoids immediate threats like water. My expectation is to check if there are new strategic options after this move."

    "content": "Given the current state of the map and the position of the avatar, we need to determine the next action based on available movements. \n\nThe avatar is located at (1, 1). The immediate environment has walls to the north (0, 1), west (1, 0), east (1, 2), and southeast (2, 2). \n\nThe goal is located at (7, 7) on the map, which is quite distant from the avatar's position. However, there are pathways available in the direction of the southeast as there's an eastward (1, 2) and southward (2, 1) space.\n\nSince the currently available movements include:\n\n- LEFT (1, 0) is blocked by a wall\n- RIGHT (1, 2) is an open floor that can be moved into\n- DOWN (2, 1) is an open floor and also can be accessed, \n- UP (0, 1) is blocked by a wall.\n\nThus, the most logical action that allows movement is to proceed south which will keep the avatar alive and allow us to navigate closer towards our goal.\n\nThe selected action is:\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action represents a move down, which is strategically sound since it keeps the avatar safe while advancing towards the goal."
