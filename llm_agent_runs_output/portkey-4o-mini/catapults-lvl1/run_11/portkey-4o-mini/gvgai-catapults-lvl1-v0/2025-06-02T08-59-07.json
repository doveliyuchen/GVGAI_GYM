The goal is to navigate the avatar towards the goal sprites 'g' located at (5, 12), (11, 14), and (14, 7). There are several water obstacles represented by 'e' that must be avoided.\n\nThe strategy involves careful navigation around walls and water, utilizing the catapult to help clear paths where necessary, and managing the avatar's positioning for optimal advancement towards the goal.\n\nGiven the options available and the current position of the avatar, it is essential for the avatar to first change orientation towards the right (east) to align with the intended movement direction.\n\nHowever, I'm currently unsure if an immediate movement can be executed toward the goal if the avatar is still facing east. Since the avatar is on 'eastfacing floor', I will first attempt a right movement to see if it can move further toward the goal directly.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis should allow the avatar to attempt moving right, expecting to progress towards the path leading closer to the rows with goal sprites while evaluating any interaction with further obstacles or catapult mechanics."
