The nearby sprites feature walls, water, and goal sprites.\n\nTo strategize, I notice:\n- Directly below me in (2, 1), there is water (marked as 'e') which is dangerous and will instantly eliminate my avatar if I move down.\n- Moving to (1, 2) right is safe as it\u2019s a floor (marked as '.').\n- To progress toward the goal, I aim to reach (5, 12) where one of the goal sprites is located.\n\nTo refine my position towards advancing while avoiding danger, my plan is:\n1. Move east to (1, 2).\n\nI will execute this as my first action.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action seems to align with my strategy of safely progressing towards reachable areas while plotting a course towards the goal."
