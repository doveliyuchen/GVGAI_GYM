There are numerous obstacles, including walls and water, that we need to navigate carefully to reach the goal.\n\n### Current Status:\n- **Avatar Position**: (1, 1)\n- **Facing Direction**: east (indicated by '@')\n- **Goal Position**: (14, 7)\n- **Obstacles**: Water (e) and walls (*)\n\n### Initial State Check:\n1. The avatar has the option to move but must avoid moving into walls or water.\n2. Moving towards the goal successfully will involve strategic direction changes and positioning.\n3. There are walls directly blocking the path to the right (east) for some distances, so navigation must be taken into account.\n\n#### Next Strategy Move:\nCurrently, the avatar is facing east. The next actionable goal would be to turn and attempt to make progress toward the right where there are spaces available, while avoiding water on the way down.\n\n##### Action Decision:\n1. Since the avatar is facing east and there's a path available to its right (east), I will move right to check if the path remains clear.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action intends to proceed east, and I expect to see progress towards the goal while avoiding obstacles."
