Upon analyzing the surrounding layout, the goal floor ('g') is present at (12,7) and (14,7), and there are water hazards (represented by 'e') nearby.\n\n### Current Location Analysis:\n- My current position (1,1):\n  - Can only move left to (1,0) (which is a wall, '*') or down to (2,1) (water, 'e'), and upward brings back to the wall.\n  - I cannot move right (1,2) (to water, 'e').\n\n### Strategy Execution:\nSince I can't move left, right, or down without hitting water or a wall, the only movement available that could possibly change my orientation is to move up towards the north, but that area will also be blocked by walls immediately.\n\nThe action I think I can take is to rotate to see if there's any potential path that hasn't been evaluated yet.\n\nHowever, since my movement is restricted, I should continue analyzing if there's nothing that I can do from my current position that aligns with the overall strategy.\n\nAs a result, I will perform the only action possible to adjust my orientation while attempting to search for a possible move.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action represents moving upwards. Although it likely results in no movement due to walls, it's necessary to exhaust the options and potentially see the environment for later turns."
