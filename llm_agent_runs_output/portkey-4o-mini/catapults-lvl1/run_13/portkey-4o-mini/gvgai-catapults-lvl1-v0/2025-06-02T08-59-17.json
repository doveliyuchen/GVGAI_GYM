The surrounding environment consists of walls (*) and water (e), which means careful navigation is essential. There is also a goal (#) at (14, 7) that needs to be reached.\n\nBased on the game rules and strategies outlined, my immediate goal is to move the avatar closer to the goal while avoiding water and walls. The primary movement options from (1, 1) would be to move right to (1, 2), which is a water tile and would result in my avatar's death, or to move downward to (2, 1) where there is more water. Instead, to make progress towards the goal and avoiding any immediate danger, I should consider moving:\n\n1. **Rotating towards DOWN** (as downward movement is necessary to explore further safely).\n2. After the rotation, I will then try moving down again to see if I can navigate through safely.\n\nLet me take the first step by trying to face a direction that allows me to eventually move down to explore more:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis is an action to face downward and then to analyze the new position. The expectation is to reach a safe area or discover new paths towards the goal."
