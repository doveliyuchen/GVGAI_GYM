To effectively analyze the situation and plan towards the goal, it's essential to consider the surroundings of the avatar.\n\n1. **Observation of Surroundings**:\n   - The avatar can move in four directions: left to (1,0), right to (1,2), down to (2,1), and up to (0,1).\n   - The immediate left to (1,0) is a wall ('*').\n   - The immediate right (1,2) is a floor ('.').\n   - The down direction (2,1) is water ('e'), which would eliminate the avatar if moved into.\n   - The up direction (0,1) is also a wall ('*').\n\n**Next Steps**: The only available movement option is to the right (1,2), which is free and doesn't lead into any traps. This action will not only allow the avatar to keep progressing but will also set us up to potentially shoot the wall directly after.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar to the right towards an open space, allowing for future strategic options while moving towards the goal."
