Current positions indicate an abundance of citizens ('&') to transform.\n\nCurrently, my avatar is in a safe spot with several citizens around, which I can convert to blessed citizens. Additionally, nearby is an input point (column 31, row 12) leading to more citizen spawns.\n\nBased on the game mechanics and the necessity of avoiding cursed transformations, a prudent move would be to progress leftwards (ACTION_LEFT) to check the immediate area for actions to transform citizens into blessed beings or to keep a safe distance from any curse-triggering bolts.\n\nThus, the chosen action is:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action keeps me aligned with the strategy as it aims to extend options for citizen interactions while remaining cautious of any potential threats nearby."

Since the avatar cannot move down due to the wall, lateral movement is essential.\n\nBased on the strategy:\n1. I will first check if moving to the left or right increases the number of citizens under my control or saves them from being transformed.\n2.
