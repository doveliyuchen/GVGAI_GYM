    "content": "Given the current state of the game:\n\n- The Avatar (marked as 'a') is located at (12, 5).\n- There are citizens (marked as '%') on the screen, and they can potentially be transformed.\n- The main objective is to transform these citizens into blessed entities (marked as 'l') while preventing the appearance of cursed sprites (marked as '&').\n\n**Current Surroundings:**\n- The Avatar is positioned near several citizens and outputs. There are blessed entities in close proximity as well.\n- There is an output point at (12, 0) where citizens can be transformed into blessed entities.\n- There is no immediate threat of cursed sprites around, but there's a demon at (1, 24) which needs to be considered for future moves.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Since the goal is to manage the transformation of citizens, I will first focus on moving toward one of the citizens (which is surrounded by the blessed entities) to ensure it can be transformed.\n   \n**Action Plan:**\n- Move **LEFT** to (12, 4) to reach the citizen before it can be affected adversely by the nearby demon or other dynamics in the area.\n\nNow I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should help in approaching the citizen to prepare for transformation while keeping away from threats."
