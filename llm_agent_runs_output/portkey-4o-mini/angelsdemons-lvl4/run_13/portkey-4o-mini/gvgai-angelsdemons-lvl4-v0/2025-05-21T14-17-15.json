Moving **DOWN** from (12, 4) would not be advisable as it will move you to an output tile (*), which will not provide direct interactions. \n2. Moving **UP** from (12, 4) to (11, 4) would put you on a space with a wall which is not ideal.\n3. Moving **LEFT** to (12, 3) is also not possible due to the wall. However, moving **RIGHT** to (12, 5) is possible.\n\nGiven there's a wall placement below and the goal of controlling the citizens, moving to (12, 5) is the best option to create movement paths for nearby citizens on the next turn.\n\nI'll execute:\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis move is expected to help in positioning closer towards citizens for potential transformations and allow for further strategic plays in the next turn."

    "content": "To understand the current state, we see that the avatar ('a') is located at (row=12, col=5). Surrounding this position, there are various sprites, including citizens ('%') directly adjacent. Our objective is to manage the transformations of these citizens while preventing the number of cursed sprites from exceeding one.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- **Adjacent Entities**: \n  - Left (row=12, col=4): '#'\n  - Right (row=12, col=6): '%'\n  - Up (row=11, col=5): 'b'\n  - Down (row=13, col=5): 'd'\n\nThe immediate right (col=6) has a citizen which can be an opportunity to bless that sprite. Since our current position has not changed, and there are no other actions that can be taken without risking a change in position, we need to take action to either move toward that citizen or engage in other mechanics.\n\n### Strategy:\nFollowing the suggested strategy, I will attempt to interact with the citizen to potentially bless it. Therefore, I will move right since this allows me to engage directly with the citizen:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to transform the citizen at (row=12, col=6) into a blessed sprite, which is crucial to the win condition. I expect that this will align with the strategy of maximizing our score and controlling cursed transformations."
