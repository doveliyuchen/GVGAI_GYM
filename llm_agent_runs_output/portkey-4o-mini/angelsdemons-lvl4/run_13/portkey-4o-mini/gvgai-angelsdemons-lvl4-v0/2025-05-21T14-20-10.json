    "content": "Given the current game state, your avatar ('a') is positioned at (9, 11), surrounded by walls to the left, and some empty spaces downwards. Furthermore, there are citizens represented by '%' that are below your current row, which implies potential interactions that could help you work towards the win condition.\n\nSince your avatar did not change position after any last action, let\u2019s analyze the nearby surroundings for possible next steps. Below the current position are several citizens that can be interacted with, so a downward move would enable interaction.\n\nBased on the strategy mentioned earlier, moving downwards allows you to potentially start converting the citizens to blessed versions or interact with objects more effectively.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should allow you to make progress toward managing citizen interactions, thus aligning with the strategy of resource management and carefully navigating within your current constraints."

    "content": "To determine your next action, it's crucial to analyze the current state and your avatar's position on the map. Your avatar is located at (10, 11), and there are several key entities close by:\n\n- Row 12, Column 5, 6, 11, and 12 have citizens represented by '%'. There are also outputs ('*') at (12, 0) and input ('i') at (12, 31).\n- Immediate surrounding might be blocked due to walls or boxes, so movement to the left (to (10, 10)), right (to (10, 12)), down (to (11, 11)), and up (to (9, 11)) needs to be evaluated.\n\nYour previous action needs to be reflected upon, and since the position of the avatar hasn\u2019t changed, you may consider further rotation or movement.\n\nYou have citizens around you, the primary objective is to interact with them to bless or save them, hence moving down toward (11, 11) where a wall ('#') exists might be limiting.\n\nGiven the need to avoid being attacked by the surrounding enemies (like demons or bolts) while also trying to manage your transformations of the citizens, a movement in a safe direction to avoid any immediate threats is necessary.\n\nAttempting to go **right (to (10, 12))** could provide a better strategic position to interact with citizens while reducing risk, as there's no curse mechanic threatening immediate danger in that space.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right opens possibilities for interactions while maintaining control of cursed sprites, which aligns with the core strategy to survive and manage the transformations effectively."
