Moving west into the empty space is a safe option, providing a way to reposition the avatar without risk of interacting with enemy sprites.\n\n### Decision:\nTo avoid the bolt and stay safe while setting up for the next move, moving west is the best action.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI am moving left into an empty space, expecting to evaluate the position further and devise a more strategic move without immediate risk of encountering an enemy."
