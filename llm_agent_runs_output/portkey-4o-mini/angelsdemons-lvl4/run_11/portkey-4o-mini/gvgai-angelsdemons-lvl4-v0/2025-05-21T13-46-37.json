There are several citizens (%), which is beneficial, as the goal is to manage and transform them into blessed entities.\n2. The avatar is surrounded by a lot of sky (b), which means it has movement options.\n3. The surrounding citizens at rows 12, 8, 14, 15, 21, 27, and 28 can potentially be interacted with to achieve the game objectives.\n\n### Strategic Move:\nGiven there are multiple citizens nearby, it would be ideal to move the avatar to interact with them in a manner that allows for transformation into blessed citizens. Additionally, the goal involves efficiently managing the flow of citizens.\n\n### Decision:\nSince the avatar is currently located at (12, 9) and the best course of action to potentially interact with a citizen would be to move left to (12, 8).\n\nTaking this into account, I will choose the action to move left and interact with the citizen:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to (12, 8) is a necessary action as it allows the avatar to prioritize interactions with the citizen while also monitoring the presence of curses nearby to mitigate risks."

By doing so, the avatar can potentially help transform this citizen or manage the flow better.\n\nThus, the action to take is: \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis moves the avatar right toward the safe area, ensuring protection from potential hazards, while keeping in mind to watch out for bolts and demons that could appear at any moment."
