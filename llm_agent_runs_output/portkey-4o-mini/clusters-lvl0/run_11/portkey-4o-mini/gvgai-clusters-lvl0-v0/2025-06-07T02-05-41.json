(empty floor)\n  - (5, 8) -> '$' (hole)\n  - (7, 8) -> '.' (empty floor)\n- (6, 10) has a '%' corresponding to a 'redblock', while (6, 6) has more boxes that might be useful for further actions.\n\n### Actions and Their Expected Outcomes\n1. **Moving LEFT (Action 1)**: \n   - If the avatar moves left to (6, 7), it will interact with the blue box ('#'). This may transform it into a block depending on adjacent blocks.\n   \n2. **Moving RIGHT (Action 2)**: \n   - Moving right to (6, 9) would place the avatar on an empty floor, a neutral move; no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Moving UP (Action 4)**: \n   - Moving up to (5, 8) is risky because it would move the avatar into a hole ('$'), resulting in point loss.\n\n4. **Moving DOWN (Action 3)**: \n   - Moving down to (7, 8) would also place the avatar on empty floor; again, no benefit achieved here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most strategically sound action is to move LEFT (Action 1) to access the blue box and potentially transform it, aligning with the game objective to eliminate boxes. \n\nThus, the chosen action is:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to facilitate a transformation of the blue box, which contributes toward winning by clearing the active boxes on the map."

The avatar can move RIGHT to (7, 5), which is also an empty space.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\nTo effectively eliminate boxes on the screen, I should move closer to either the blue or red boxes to maximize interactions leading to transformations. Since the blue boxes (which lead to higher score through interactions) are at (2, 3) and (2, 4), moving towards those would be optimal. However, I currently can't access them directly. \n\n### Planned Move:\nI will move DOWN to (8, 4), which keeps me in the lower row but plans future moves to maneuver towards one of the active boxes.\n\n```Action: 3```\n\nThis move allows me to keep exploring the level while considering future interactions. I anticipate that by staying flexible in the lower section, I'll be able to rotate and plan for upcoming interactions with boxes."
