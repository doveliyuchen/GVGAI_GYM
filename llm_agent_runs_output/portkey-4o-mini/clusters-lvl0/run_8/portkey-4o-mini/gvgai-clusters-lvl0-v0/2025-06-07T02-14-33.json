A **DOWN** move (to (5, 6)) keeps you on empty ground but again not closer to the box.\n4. An **UP** move (3, 6) isn't beneficial since you're blocked by walls and maintaining your position.\n\nSince moving left seems to keep you in the correct direction while staying safe, I will proceed with that action.\n\nThus, I will choose to move left. \n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nI expect that moving left will help to explore options to push boxes toward an advantageous position."
