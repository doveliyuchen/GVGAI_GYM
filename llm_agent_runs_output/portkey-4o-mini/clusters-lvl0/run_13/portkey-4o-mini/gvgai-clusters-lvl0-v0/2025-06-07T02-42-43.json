However, moving right to the blue box will engage with it.\n\n2. **Strategic Decision**:\n   - The most immediate action is to either engage with the blue box or move to an open floor space.\n   - Immovable objects (walls) limit potential exploration.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo optimize the current situation, interacting with the blue box seems to be a good approach as it may allow for further transformations. Thus, I will choose to move right.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should lead to engaging with the blue box, which might be transformational, aiding in clearing boxes from the level towards achieving the objective. I expect this move to be productive in progressing towards a win condition."
