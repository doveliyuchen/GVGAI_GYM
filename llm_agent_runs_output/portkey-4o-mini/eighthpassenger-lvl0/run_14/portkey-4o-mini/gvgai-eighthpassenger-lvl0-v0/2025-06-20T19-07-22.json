Our objective is to survive and ultimately reach the exit at (2, 26). \n\nSince the avatar's position has not changed from its previous state, and considering the presence of the pursuer directly below, we need to reassess our movement options to avoid immediate danger. The adjacent tiles to the avatar are:\n\n- (11, 3) \u2192 e (empty, above)\n- (11, 4) \u2192 e (empty, above-right)\n- (12, 2) \u2192 . (empty, left)\n- (12, 4) \u2192 & (empty, right, possible crouch mechanics)\n- (13, 3) \u2192 e (empty, below)\n\nIn this scenario, moving down into tile (12, 4) would bring us into the pursuer's line of sight or immediate danger, so it\u2019s best to move out of the way.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nMoving upwards to (11, 3) is the safest option as it provides distance away from the pursuer while allowing for options to escape or continue maneuvering around the obstacles.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action should effectively create distance from the pursuer while also potentially allowing further movement options, which aligns with the strategy of avoiding enemies and navigating through the environment effectively."
