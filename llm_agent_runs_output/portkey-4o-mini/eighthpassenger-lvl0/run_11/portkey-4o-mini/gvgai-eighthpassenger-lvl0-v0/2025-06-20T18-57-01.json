To evaluate the best action, I see that:\n\n- **Directly to the left (12, 1)** is empty (.)\n- **Directly to the right (12, 3)** has a pursuer (%)\n- **Above (11, 2)** is empty (e)\n- **Below (13, 2)** is empty (e)\n\nCurrently, there is a pursuer directly to the right, creating a risk if I move in that direction. Since the strategy emphasizes stealth, I want to avoid drawing attention, particularly now that there is enemy presence close.\n\nConsidering this, the safest action is to move **up** to (11, 2), maintaining a stealthy position and avoiding the pursuer on the right.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nBy moving up, I can observe the situation from a better vantage point while remaining hidden, and it aligns with the strategy to stay away from enemies."
