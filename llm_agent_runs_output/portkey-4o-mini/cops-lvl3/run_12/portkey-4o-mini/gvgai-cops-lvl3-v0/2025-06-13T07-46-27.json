The avatar hasn't moved recently, so I need to evaluate my options carefully to progress towards the goals.\n\n### Actions to Consider:\n- Moving up to (12, 12) puts us directly on the jail, which could allow for strategic resource use.\n- Moving left to (13, 11) or right to (13, 13) might lead to areas with different sprites (though both of them are empty).\n\n### Decision:\nSince the jail could provide added resources, it would be logical to take action to move the avatar onto the jail.\n\n**Action:** Move UP to the jail.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up to the jail could open the opportunity to interact with it, potentially clarifying next steps for resource management.

There are **jails** (marked by `%`) and **resources** (like keys) to collect. \n3. The avatar's next potential goal could involve reaching one of the jail doors (`&`) above, particularly at positions (11, 6) or (3, 7).\n4. The avatar can move up, down, left, or right, but it must avoid walls (marked by `b`).\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nSince the avatar is at (14, 5) and we are considering reaching one of the jail areas, moving **up** will get the avatar closer to the zone of interaction with the jail doors at (11, 6).\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nMoving **up** is a sound decision as it aligns with the strategy to seek resource collection and explore jails. It will position the avatar closer to doors that may lead to spawning useful transport and gathering keys. I expect to find either a jail interaction area or further pathways to collect resources in the next state."

The immediate surroundings consist of floors ('.'), walls ('b'), and several key features, such as jail doors ('&'), which could potentially lead to resources or enable further actions.\n\n### Current Analysis:\n- **Avatar Position**: (14, 13) is adjacent to wall tiles (above, below, left, and right) and there are no collectable resources or enemies nearby.\n- **Nearest Goals**: The closest jail door is located at (11, 6), which is a bit far and would require movement towards the upper rows. There are also enemy types like greenthugs ($) located at (8, 1) and (9, 1) but these are also distant.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince your avatar has not moved since the last state, you should try to explore towards the jail doors which could contain keys or other resources essential for progressing. Thus, moving `UP` towards (13, 13) seems to be the most effective action to start your exploration.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will choose to move **UP** to (13, 13).\n\n```Action: 4```\nThis action positions me closer to potential resource gathering points and possible interactions with game elements (like jail doors)."

I can attempt to **move left towards the jail door ('&')**, which allows access to the area beyond it.\n2. As per the rules, if I move left (towards the jail door), and the avatar does not change, I may need to rotate and try again.\n\nGiven the strategic advice, interacting with the jail door will potentially lead to resource collection or further gameplay advantages.\n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left towards the jail door is strategic to access its contents and possibly progress in the game. I expect this action will lead me to sample new resources or enable further actions in the game."

Since there is no immediate obstacle below (the next row is empty), moving down could provide access to nearby items. \n2. **Evaluation of Enemies**: There are no immediate enemies in the surrounding area, allowing for a safe move.\n\nGiven that the avatar hasn't moved from its last position and to align with the strategy of resource collection, I will take action to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will move the avatar down to (row=14, col=6), which is an open tile.
