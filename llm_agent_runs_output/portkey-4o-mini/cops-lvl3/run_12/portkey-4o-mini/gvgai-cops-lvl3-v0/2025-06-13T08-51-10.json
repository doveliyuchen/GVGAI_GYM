However, if you are not carrying any, it would be feasible to explore further by moving towards positions that might provide more resources or enemy interactions.\n\n#### Action Analysis:\n- You could move down to (15, 11), which is a wall and would stop your movement.\n- You could move left to (14, 10), which is a floor space (.), allowing exploration.\n- You could move right to (14, 12), which is a jail (%). This would be beneficial if you have villains to deposit.\n- You could move up to (13, 11), which is a floor space (.), providing another exploration route.\n\nGiven that no actions from the last condition have changed your position, I will prioritize an exploration move that could maximize interactions and resources retrieval.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move **LEFT to (14, 10)** to open up more options in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move allows for further exploration in the next turn, potentially leading to more opportunities for resource collection."
