Since we know from the last state that the avatar did not change position, applying a rotation movement (ACTION_UP or ACTION_LEFT) won't take the player anywhere either.\n\nConsidering my current options, it's crucial to find an alternative method, perhaps wait or prepare to take a different action once a potential movement path opens up.\n\nI'll select the Action 0: \n``` \nAction:0 \n```\nThis action is inactive and serves as a placeholder until a viable next move is determined.

Moving to (14, 12) (the left action) will allow me to explore a pathway while getting closer to the area where I can collect resources or find a key.\n2. Utilizing the depot could provide beneficial resources but would take me away from immediate engagement with the boss.\n\nConsidering the need to navigate towards the boss while optimizing resources effectively, I will choose to move left to (14, 12).\n\n```Action: 1```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of moving towards resource and avoiding unnecessary engagements with the enemy.

I'll be able to collect resources or navigate upwards after this, ensuring progress towards defeating the boss promptly."

The focus should be on leveraging the resources available while avoiding enemies, and I have to move to achieve the objective of defeating the boss.\n\nCurrently, my direct goals can include:\n1. Assessing the immediate area for potential moves.\n2. Collecting keys or resources while avoiding thugs.\n3. Finding a strategic position to confront the boss later.\n\nSince the available actions are directional and I need to perhaps rotate to align with a suitable path, I'll take the action to see if I can effectively navigate. \n\nI'll move **left** (to (row=13, col=11)), as it opens potential paths and doesn't put me in immediate danger:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow me to assess the new position to identify further strategic moves towards the boss and resource collection."
