The map reveals a significant challenge with many walls (`b`), thugs, and some interactable objects such as jail doors (`&`) and depots (`#`). \n\nTo decide on the next action, we must consider our immediate objectives and the overall strategy outlined.\n\n1. **Immediate Objective**: Your avatar is surrounded by walls and there are some jail doors above at (row 11, col 6), (row 12, col 2), and more options to the left. The closest depot with an item (-possibly key) is at (row 13, col 13) but it might be better to open up more options.\n\n2. **Strategy**: \n   - According to the strategy, you need to avoid confrontations with thugs, particularly since the boss character is in the vicinity.\n   - You must manage resources by collecting keys and avoiding immediate threats.\n\n3. **Analysis of Movement**: \n   - You can only move left onto an empty cell (but there's an `&` just above), or exit vertically, with the vertical space being more valuable for evasion and collection strategy.\n\nThus, the safest and most strategic action in this situation is to **move UP** into an empty space above (into the cell at row 13, col 13), which allows further navigation with less confrontation risk.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis should help keep your avatar safe while progressing up the map towards potentially useful resources and avoiding immediate threats."

This could lead to possible interactions with keys or strategizing for future moves. However, as it doesn't change my position since the jail is present there, moving to (14, 12) has to be the first action.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action is necessary as it reflects my intent to explore the area below my current position and prepare for further strategic moves.

Surrounding me are the wall on the right (14, 14), a jail door to the left (13, 12), and floor tiles in vertical proximity.\n\nSince my position hasn't changed from the last state and I need to act differently, my most strategic move is to engage with that jail door at (13, 12) directly, as interacting with doors can potentially open paths for progress.\n\nThus, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nI expect to interact with the jail door to either gather resources or find a way to advance further in the game."
