Collecting keys to manage doors and the villain resources efficiently.\n2. Planning movements to engage with or avoid enemies when necessary.\n3. Focusing on defeating red thugs first when encountered for maximum score.\n\nFrom the current position, moving towards the jail door will be my immediate goal, as it could allow me to utilize the spawn point for resources and potentially interact with any nearby enemies.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the jail door is two steps to the right, the most efficient action to take next is to move right.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will bring me closer to the jail door, which is a critical resource point for spawning villains.
