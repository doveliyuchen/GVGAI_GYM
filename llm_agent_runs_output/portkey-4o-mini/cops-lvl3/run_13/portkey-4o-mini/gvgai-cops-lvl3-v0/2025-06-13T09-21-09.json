Engaging with these thugs might yield resources.\n\n3. **Movement Options**: The avatar can move LEFT (towards row=14, col=12), RIGHT (towards row=14, col=14 which is a wall), UP (towards row=13, col=13), or DOWN (to row=15, col=13 which is also a wall).\n\nGiven these options, the LEFT move (to (row=14, col=12)) is the only viable action that can be executed since it allows the avatar to position themselves to maneuver towards the enemies and further enhance their resource collection strategy.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action is expected to change the position of the avatar, allowing for potential further engagements with remaining thugs and opening pathways to jails and resources on the next moves."
