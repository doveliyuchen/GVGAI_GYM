Since the priority is to boil the pasta before serving, I need to determine the next action that will allow me to progress effectively towards boiling the raw pasta.\n\nTo start, I am currently located at (7, 2).

This is an essential step since preparing the pasta will be my next focus.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action brings me to the raw pasta, allowing me to initiate the correct combination for my dish more effectively."
