The immediate surroundings include an empty floor tile where several actions can be taken. \n\n### Objective Analysis\nFrom the proposed overall strategy, you want to create a \"plate in place\" which involves manipulating the available ingredients. \n\n### Available Ingredients\n- There is raw pasta ('%') at (7, 3) directly above your avatar.\n- There is also a tuna ('*') at (7, 5) directly above your avatar as well.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation\nLooking at your current strategy and the ingredients nearby, the next logical move would be to collect the raw pasta first to eventually cook it. \n\n### Suggested Action\nTo move closer to the raw pasta at (7, 3), the appropriate action would be to move up. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up to collect the raw pasta is a step towards preparing the final dish, and it aligns with your strategy of gathering essential ingredients without making incorrect combinations that could lead to penalties."
