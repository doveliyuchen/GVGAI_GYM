The closest boiling water is located at (2, 3).\n\nHere\u2019s a brief analysis of my options:\n- I can attempt to move left, right, up, or down. However, going left (to (7, 1)) or up (to (6, 2)) leads to walls, which would be ineffective actions.\n- Moving down (to (8, 2)) or right (to (7, 3), where the raw pasta is located) allows for potential interaction.\n\nSince I cannot interact with the boiling water directly, I need to figure out a way to navigate towards it.\n\nTo ensure progress, I will take the action to reach the raw pasta first and prepare for future combinations once I acquire boiling water.\n\nThus, I will:\n``` Action:3 ``` \nThis action will move down to (8, 2), which is a valid space. This first step will avoid backtracking and open more possibilities for further actions."

Surrounding elements are as follows:\n\n- At (row=7, col=1) there's a free floor (.), \n- At (row=7, col=3) there's a raw pasta (%).\n\nYour goal is to optimize the collection and combination of ingredients to create dishes while avoiding penalties.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven your current position, there are two potential moves:\n1. Move left to (row=7, col=1) to an empty space. \n2. Move right to (row=7, col=3) to collect the raw pasta.\n\nCollecting the raw pasta at (row=7, col=3) would be a beneficial action as it adds to your ingredients without any immediate risk of negative scoring.\n\nSince your avatar was last positioned at (7, 2) and you are not collecting items directly yet, the next action should be to move right in order to collect the raw pasta item immediately.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action of moving right will allow you to collect the raw pasta, a crucial step toward creating a dish. I expect this aligns well with the strategy of combining ingredients effectively."
