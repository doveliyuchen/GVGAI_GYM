The immediate area consists of walls (`b`) surrounding the avatar, with a few important items located nearby. Here's a summary of what we find:\n\n- **Ingredients and accessible items around the avatar**:\n  - `boilingwater @` is located at (2, 3).\n  - `rawpasta %` is at (7, 3).\n  - `tomato &` is present at (2, 10).\n  - `tuna *` is at (5, 5).\n  \nNext, considering the strategic approach established earlier, the avatar needs to collect ingredients in the correct order and navigate through the environment without making any wrong moves. \n\nSince the avatar is currently not adjacent to any useful ingredients, the next logical step is to position the avatar closer to the `rawpasta` (7, 3) as it's essential to combine it with `boilingwater` first to create `pastainplace` in a following turn.\n\n### My Action Plan:\n1. **Move upwards** to (8, 3) to bring the avatar closer to the `rawpasta`.\n\nNow, I will execute the corresponding action.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should correctly position the avatar closer to the `rawpasta`, aligning with our overall strategy to prepare ingredients efficiently for combining."
