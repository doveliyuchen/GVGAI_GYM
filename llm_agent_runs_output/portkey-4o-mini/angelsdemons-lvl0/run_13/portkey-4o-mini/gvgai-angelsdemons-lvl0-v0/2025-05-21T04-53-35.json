Keep **cursed citizens below the limit of 1** to avoid losing the game.\n3. Interact safely with citizens without being affected by bolts.\n4. Aim to manage the citizens while avoiding the demon (&) and bolts (o).\n\n### Nearby Key Elements\n- At (12, 11) where the avatar is positioned, I see:\n  - **Citizens** represented as `%` located at (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 12), (12, 18), (12, 19), and (12, 24). These are potential targets for transformation into blessed citizens.\n  - The **output** (`*`) is at (12, 31), which may be a location to drop off or finalize citizens after transformation.\n  \n### Current Threats\n- There are **bolts**:\n  - (1, 9): A bolt is present that could potentially affect citizens but is far from the avatar\u2019s current position.\n  - It\u2019s important to keep an eye on this since if a bolt hits a citizen, they could turn cursed.\n\n### Plan of Action\nMy primary focus will be to move toward the citizens to transform them while ensuring I do not come into contact with the bolts. The safest course of action is to head down towards one of the available `'%` citizens positions.\n\nGiven that my last action must have been a directional movement, I will choose the downward movement now to reach the citizens:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action should ultimately bring me closer to the available citizens, helping facilitate their transformation while avoiding immediate hazards.
