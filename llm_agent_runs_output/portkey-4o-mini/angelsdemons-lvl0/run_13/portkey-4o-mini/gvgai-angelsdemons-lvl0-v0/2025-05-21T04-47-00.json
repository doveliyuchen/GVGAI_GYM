This indicates there is a citizen nearby who can potentially be transformed or directed toward the output.\n   \n2. **Citizen Management**: It\u2019s crucial to maximize the conversion of citizens to blessed states while avoiding changes that would lead to cursed sprites. The avatar's immediate task should be to interact with the citizen or to position itself favorably to help achieve a transformation.\n\n3. **Immediate Goals**: The output located at (12, 30) could be a target for citizens if they are transformed correctly. Therefore, the avatar should either move towards the nearest citizen to influence its transformation or create a pathway for citizens to reach the output.\n\n### Current Actions:\nGiven the outlined strategy, the best action from the avatar's current position is to move right (ACTION_RIGHT) toward the output. This action might serve to position the avatar more favorably for the next move, either influencing nearby sprites or allowing citizens to continue to the output without obstruction.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will move the avatar closer to the goal of maximizing conversions while facilitating easier citizen movement towards the output in subsequent turns."

The first suitable move is to the left toward the first group of citizens present at (12, 5).\n\n### Selected Action\nI will execute the movement to the left of my avatar:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis will position my avatar closer to the citizen sprites for potential interaction and transformation, aligning with our strategy for maximizing scoring opportunities."

The objective centers around controlling citizen transformations while avoiding curses and threats from demons represented as `&` and bolts represented as `f`. \n\nGiven the last state, your avatar has not moved and is positioned among several citizens. The goal should be to secure the citizens and convert them to blessed states if possible. \n\n### Current Situation\n- Your avatar is positioned at (12, 12).\n- You have various citizens immediately adjacent at (12, 11) and around.\n- There are outputs `(13, 31)` that can potentially help in scoring if you can get blessed or transformed citizens nearby.\n\n### Strategic Action\nConsidering the avatar's current position and the immediate surroundings, I'll make the following assessment:\n\n1. **Citizens Nearby**: Two citizens to interact with \u2014 at (12, 11) directly to the left, and there's another at (12, 14) (if we move right).\n2. **Transformations**: The goal is to keep the cursed sprite count low.

We should look to guide citizens to the angel when possible for conversion to \"blessed\" states.\n3. **Wall Utilization**: There are walls nearby which can be used to direct citizen paths strategically to avoid threats and optimize conversions.\n\n### Decision\nI'll choose to **move left** to interact with the citizen at (12, 11) and potentially guide or transform them, adhering to the strategic guidelines of prioritizing citizen management.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is aimed at potentially converting a close citizen or managing the citizen count effectively while adhering to the escape strategy."

Your main objectives are to manage the citizens effectively, avoiding transformations into cursed sprites, while maximizing points by guiding citizens into blessed transformations. \n\nSince your avatar's position has not changed and it is currently placed next to a number of citizens but also surrounded by openings (including a potential interaction with the output), the next action must be carefully considered.\n\nHere\u2019s what can be deduced about your next move:\n\n1. You are adjacent to several citizens and the output point.\n2. Your primary concern is that there are no cursed sprites on the board, and your upcoming action should aim to convert citizens into blessed sprites or guide them towards salvation.\n\n### Available Action Decision:\nGiven that you're positioned at (11, 18) and can either move to (11, 17) or (11, 19), moving **RIGHT** (to column 19) will provide you the possibility to engage with the citizens nearby and potentially help them convert or escape, as column 19 contains more citizens rather than walls or hazardous elements. \n\nTherefore, the optimal action here is:\n\n```Action: 2```\n\nThis action should allow for better management of citizen transformations while getting closer to the potential output goal."

Transform citizens into blessed sprites to reduce the number of cursed sprites.\n2. Stay clear of demon sprites (at rows 1, especially at (1, 7) and (1, 8) which may cause harm).\n3.

The avatar has options to move into empty spaces to navigate around obstacles or towards potential citizen encounters.\n3. Since the avatar\u2019s position hasn\u2019t changed from the last known state, we might need to execute a movement action, optimizing its position to ensure efficient handling of upcoming interactions.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nSince the avatar can either move up, down, left, or right into empty spaces:\n- **Action 1 (ACTION_LEFT)** will position the avatar towards column 18, which is still an open space and keeps the avatar close to the citizens above and below.\n\nThis action allows for further strategic positioning amidst citizens and outputs, aligning with the overall strategy of citizen management.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThe expected outcome is to maintain or enhance the positioning for upcoming actions while aligning with the goal of managing citizen interactions and outcomes effectively."

The goal is to manage the citizens while avoiding cursed transformations, aiming to potentially collect them with the avatar.\n\n### Strategy Recap\n\n1. **Manage Citizens**: The goal is to convert as many citizens to blessed as possible.\n2. **Avoid Cursed Transformations**: Be wary of any threats, although currently, there don't seem to be immediate dangers in the vicinity.\n3. **Use Output Effectively**: The output is at (12, 31) where I can potentially deposit citizens and score. \n\n### Current Analysis\n\n- The citizens are crowded around positions (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 10), (12, 11), etc., which means that they can be guided either to the output point at (12, 31) or potentially transformed into blessed citizens using angels nearby.\n- My immediate vicinity is safe, with walls below. \n\n### Action Decision\n\nSince my avatar's direction hasn't changed, I should try moving left into position (12, 23) which is empty. This gives me a chance to gain a better view of the situation and potentially prepare for guiding citizens to the output or utilizing walls for transforming them later.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is intended to reposition and analyze further for the best method to engage with the citizens effectively."

Since the avatar needs to act differently than the last movement, a right move to (12, 23) seems consistent with potential citizen management and scoring opportunities.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nMoving right keeps the avatar productive in managing citizens without leaving their vicinity and thus aids in avoiding any risk of accumulating cursed sprites.\n\n```Action: 2``` \nThis is expected to align with the strategy of maximizing citizen management and avoiding risk effectively."
