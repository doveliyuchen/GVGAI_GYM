The immediate goal involves managing the nearby citizens effectively.\n\n4. **Evaluating Interactions**:\n   - If the avatar interacts with the `%` citizen at (12, 13) or any of the other citizens, we must ensure that such interactions do not lead to cursed transformations. In terms of transformations, we would ideally want to move towards one of the citizens to start guiding them towards `salvation` or prevent any potential cursed transformations caused by bolts.\n\n5. **Previous Action**: Since the initial state does not provide previous actions, let's take a fundamental approach initially.

This will be the first step in managing sprite interactions effectively.\n\n```Action: 1```\nMoving left to (12, 9) allows me to interact with a citizen, which is aligned with the objective of transforming citizens and avoiding cursed sprites.
