The output point `*` is at (12, 31).\n- The immediate area around the avatar has solid walls and cannot facilitate side movements to reach the output directly.\n- The portal/input point `i` is at (12, 0), which could be a potential area to spawn more citizens.\n\n### Current Action Plan:\n1. The avatar can't move left due to walls (`d`).\n2. Moving right to (11, 31) won't assist in reaching any key objectives or reducing the risk of interactions with cursed sprites.\n3. Moving down to (12, 30) or up to (10, 30) could potentially allow further actions.\n4.
