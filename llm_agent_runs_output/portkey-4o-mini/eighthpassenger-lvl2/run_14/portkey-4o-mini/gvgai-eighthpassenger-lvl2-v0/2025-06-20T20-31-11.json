There are areas with closed doors (denoted by `#`), specific tunnels (`d`), and pursuers (`%`).\n2. The exit is denoted by `$` located at (row=7, col=14). \n3. The area is filled with enemies (aliens `@`) primarily in row 12 and several at row 1.\n\n### Strategy Recap\n1. Avoid enemies, especially aliens (`@`).\n2. Use available tunnels (`d` and `s`) to hide from pursuers and aliens.\n3. Activate switches (`*`) to open doors and create movement options.\n4. Prioritize reaching the exit (`$`) while maintaining a higher score.\n\n### Plan of Action\nWithout a direct mention of the avatar's position, the initial action will be to attempt to move either `left` or `right` and observe the outcome. Based on the map layout and suggested strategy, let's take a potential action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action means moving **RIGHT** toward a more open space and checking if I am able to head towards the exit without engaging the aliens or other enemies.
