Our avatar can crouch to stealthily navigate around potential threats, and we also have the option of utilizing the paths opened by the switches (notably located at row 7, column 17).\n\nThe move options available are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

I need to avoid moving directly down as it will bring me into contact with the alien sprite, resulting in a score penalty.\n2. Moving left or right could allow me to maneuver around and look for alternate paths. However, the map in this region is fairly open, with a lot of walls (e) surrounding me and not offering many options for movement.\n3. Moving up would also allow me to navigate without risking contact with enemies immediately.\n\nFor this turn, I will take the **ACTION_LEFT** to reposition my avatar away from immediate danger and reassess potential future movements without getting cornered by the threats nearby.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nI expect this action will help me look for a safer path towards the exit while avoiding the aliens."

You need to evade the pursuer while also seeking a way towards the exit (`$`) located at (7, 14).\n\nFollowing the game's strategy of careful movement and positioning, I should take action to transition to a safer position while maintaining momentum towards the exit.\n\nAnalyzing the available actions:\n1. **Up to (10, 1)** - this position is not effective since it's not moving toward cover or safety.\n2. **Down to (12, 1)** - this would lead directly into the enemy (`%`), which is a loss condition.\n3. **Left to (11, 0)** - this is a wall (`e`), so no movement possible.\n4. **Right to (11, 2)** - this remains in danger as it is still beside the pursuer.\n\nThus, the only sensible move is to crouch before making a lateral move to avoid detection, while also providing options for subsequent movements towards the exit. Hence, I will switch to a crouching position and prepare to make further tactical decisions.\n\nChoosing to perform an action that changes the avatar's position safely while avoiding the pursuer's range of action helps in letting me plan for the next optimal move.\n\n``` \nAction: 0 \n```\n\nThis is a preparatory action; we will observe the next movements of the sprites and reassess the situation afterward to execute a forward move toward the exit.

Using crouching to avoid detection could be beneficial.\n\n3. **Strategic Move:**\n   - Since the avatar is at (11, 1) and there\u2019s an immediate danger from the pursuer at (11, 2), the best course of action appears to be to either move away from the pursuer or crouch.\n\nGiven that the last action focused on avoiding detection by the pursuer, and since the enemy is one block to the right, I will take a cautious approach and choose to **move left** to (11, 0).
