The presence of a key close by (at row 10, col 10) and the immediate option to collect a small goal (at row 10, col 11) suggests focusing on these items for the next move.\n\nI will take the action to **move right** towards the key since it's the logical choice to collect an item that will help with unlocking doors later and also leads to a collectible.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nMoving right to collect the key is a strategic decision to enhance my capabilities without immediate combat risk, and I expect this will effectively position the avatar for further exploration."
