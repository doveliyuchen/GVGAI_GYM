Collecting keys will be crucial for unlocking potential goals.\n3. **Enemies**: Several enemies exist within the environment, including normal monsters `$` at positions (1, 10) and (6, 10), as well as a monster at (7, 9). Engaging with them should be approached cautiously.\n4. **Walls**: The level has many **walls** (`w`), which restrict movement, particularly in the top rows.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nBased on the primary objectives of the game (collect keys and reach goals), the primary focus should be on either collecting the key at (10, 10) or attacking the nokey at (10, 6) to obtain a key. Since my avatar must initially navigate the layout, I should also be mindful of potential enemy encounters.\n\nAs I do not see my current position as having been provided, I assume a position adjacent to either the nokey or the large goal. If I am at (10, 6) (on the nokey), I should attack to get a key; otherwise, if I am at (10, 10), I should collect the key. \n\nGiven I must choose an action without knowing my current position directly, let\u2019s consider the action to go downwards towards the nokey position to engage with it.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action allows me to target the nokey sprite, given that in the previous state, my avatar should shift to this important interaction efficiently. If I was at (10, 6), I\u2019ll engage successfully and prepare for future key collection."
