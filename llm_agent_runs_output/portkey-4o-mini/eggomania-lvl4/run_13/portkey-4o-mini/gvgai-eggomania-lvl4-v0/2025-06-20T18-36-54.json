There are also several walls ('%') surrounding the avatar, which restricts movement options.\n\nAt this moment, the avatar has the potential to take the following actions:\n1. **Use an explosive egg (ACTION_USE)** if it has any available.\n2. **Move left (ACTION_LEFT)** to (12, 4) or\n3. **Move right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (12, 6).\n\nHowever, the broken eggs indicate that I would lose if they are not dealt with, and the chickens pose a significant threat.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The critical issue in the current state is the existence of the broken eggs. \n- I do not have any data indicating my explosive egg count; thus, I assume I must collect more eggs before attacking.\n- The priority now is to collect more explosive eggs, and the available options do not involve immediate danger.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince I am aware of broken eggs and want to avoid getting killed while also potentially collecting more explosive eggs to use later, I should navigate the area to gather resources.\n\nTo start, I will move **right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (12, 6), which is empty and may provide new insights on my immediate surroundings for further actions.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis action should allow me to assess further interactive resources while maintaining safe positioning with potential future actions planned against the broken eggs and chickens."
