Collecting these will help prepare for defense against chickens.\n2. **Avoid Threats:** Fast chickens are present in row 1, which makes it crucial to stay mobile to avoid being cornered.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven that the avatar is stationary (since there\u2019s no action recorded previously), I will move left (Action 2) to potentially retrieve explosive eggs or reposition to avoid the threats.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is anticipated to help me move towards explosive eggs, enhancing my resource stock and maintaining a safe distance from the threats."

My first action should be to assess the surrounding area for resources and threats.\n\nIn my current position:\n- The nearest explosive egg resources are at (row=6, col=21) and (row=11, col=26).\n- There are no immediate threats from chickens since the nearest chicken is at (row=1, col=15) and (row=1, col=16), which are quite distant.\n\nTo optimize my strategy and collect resources effectively, I will consider moving towards the explosive eggs while maintaining a safe distance from any potential threats. Moving right, however, doesn't lead me directly towards the resources but could allow me to reposition better.\n\nAfter evaluating my options and considering the mechanics of the game (especially the rotation mechanics and potential chicken movement), I will proceed with moving right.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving right will allow me to change my positioning and access new areas, enhancing my ability to collect resources while avoiding threats. My expectation is to see new surroundings that either provide more resources or a clear path away from chickens."

There are no immediate threats from chickens in your vicinity, as the closest enemy is a slow chicken at row 1, column 8 and a fast chicken at row 1, column 15, which are far from your position. \n\nYou should focus on collecting resources while avoiding potential threats and keeping an eye on your surroundings. The surrounding area contains several eggs (denoted by 'e') you can collect, particularly in the row above (row 11 has two eggs at columns 26 and 27) and in the row below (row 13 has multiple walls and no eggs). \n\nAccording to the strategy:\n1. **Prioritize Resource Collection**: It's sensible to move towards the nearby eggs, which are beneficial for your ammo.\n2. **Movement**: You need to determine an appropriate action to move toward the nearest eggs, located at row 11, column 26 and 27.\n\nSince you are currently positioned at (12, 1) and want to gather eggs in row 11, moving upwards to row 11, column 26 (or 27) is the priority. The best action would be to move left towards column 26 as there's an egg there.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action reflects the strategy of resource collection while also maintaining safety from threats.
