Their proximity poses a threat, mainly due to the fast chicken ('@').\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the avatar's position and the presence of nearby resource eggs, a strategic approach would be to move right to (12, 2) to collect the egg. This will also keep me away from immediate collisions with chickens since there aren\u2019t any chickens in the immediate right vicinity.\n\nI will take the action to move right to collect the egg. \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nFeedback: This action will allow me to collect an explosive egg while avoiding the immediate threat of the chickens above me. I expect to increase my resources and maintain a safe distance from the threats."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, let's summarize some key points:\n\n- **Avatar Position:** The avatar ('a') is located at (12, 2).\n- **Enemies Present:** There are fast chickens ('@') at (1, 13) and (1, 14) and slow chickens ('#') at (1, 9) and (1, 10).\n- **Resources:** There are several explosive eggs ('e') available throughout the map.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. **Collecting Resources:** The avatar has easy access to various 'e' located at (3, 9), (8, 20), (8, 21), (9, 20), (9, 21), (10, 23), (11, 23), and there are also broken eggs ('*') which can be transformed into something useful.\n2. **Enemy Proximity:** The fast chickens are relatively far from the avatar's current position, allowing for some flexibility in movement without immediate threat.\n3. **Avoidance and Attack:** We need to consider maintaining a distance from the chickens while collecting resources, especially explosive eggs for future confrontations.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed and no attack is imminent, I will focus on collecting explosive eggs from the nearby locations that are safe.\n\nThe best course of action to efficiently gather resources would be to move towards the explosive egg at (3, 9).\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` \nAction: 2  \n```\n\nThis action will move the avatar left to (12, 1), allowing further navigation toward the explosive egg without encountering walls or enemies directly. After this move, I hope to assess the situation to plan the next step effectively."

    "content": "In the current state, the avatar ('a') is located at row 12, column 1. According to the map, there are several resources (eggs) nearby, specifically at row 11, column 23 and row 12, column 23. The strategy suggests focusing on collecting explosive eggs while avoiding contact with the chickens and utilizing walls to manage the chicken's movement.\n\nGiven that there's no immediate threat of a chicken nearby and multiple eggs are present to gather, the most logical action would be to move toward the egg at row 12, column 23.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move to the right since my current position is (12, 1), and moving right towards (12, 2) is free space, with the goal to eventually position myself nearer to the egg at (12, 23).\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action allows me to strategically position towards the resources while ensuring I remain safe from any potential threats. I expect that collecting the eggs will contribute significantly to resource management, as discussed in the strategy."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar (denoted as 'a') is located at coordinates (row 12, col 2). The immediate area contains various resources (eggs) and walls, but no threats such as chickens in close proximity. Your main goal is to gather resources for effective gameplay while avoiding collisions with enemies.\n\n### Map Analysis:\n- The surrounding area has several 'e' (explosive eggs) at (row 3, col 9), (row 3, col 14), (row 3, col 15), (row 9, col 20), (row 9, col 21), (row 11, col 23), (row 12, col 23).\n- You're positioned a bit far from the nearest egg located at (row 3, col 9).\n- There are walls and obstacles obstructing paths, particularly in the upper rows.\n\n### Strategic Objective:\nTo win efficiently, you should focus on progressing towards the nearest explosive eggs to bolster your resources, as collecting these will help in combating any enemy threats that might appear later.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. Move left (to (row 12, col 1)), which does not yield immediate resource gain.\n2. Move right (to (row 12, col 3)), which could keep you in a safe position and allow for observation of nearby resources.\n3. Use an explosive egg if you have one, which currently seems unnecessary given the surroundings.\n4. Take no action, which would not be beneficial either.\n\nSince your avatar position does not change from the last action (you did not specify one), I will opt for the directional action that doesn't lead you towards walls yet moves you closer to your objective.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving right to (row 12, col 3) will help assess the environment further, giving you a better strategic view on the availability of resources and any movements by potential chickens. I expect that this aligns with the strategy of gathering resources efficiently."

Let's consider the strategic suggestions and assess immediate actions:\n\n### State Overview:\n1. **Avatar Position:** (12, 3)\n2. **Nearby Resources:**\n   - Explosive egg (row 12, column 23)\n   - Explosive egg (row 12, column 3, adjacent to wall)\n   - Various empty spaces (indicated by '.')\n\n3. **Walls:** There are walls cutting off several paths which may hinder direct movement.\n4. **Enemies:** No enemies are currently in the immediate vicinity.\n\n### Next Steps and Strategy:\n- **Action Opportunity:** You can move to collect explosive eggs safely since there are no chickens currently threatening your avatar.\n  \n### Assessment:\n- The avatar should either collect an explosive egg or navigate towards safety.\n- Since the player hasn\u2019t moved from the previous position and needs to take an action, I will focus on moving towards the nearby explosive egg.\n\n### Consequential Action:\nI will use the action to move to the right, as going in this direction can lead the avatar toward the explosive egg at (12, 23). \n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis decision aligns with the strategy of resource management by collecting explosive eggs while ensuring safety, as no enemies are immediately present."

Looking at the map, I observe that there is an explosive egg on (11, 23) and multiple eggs scattered downwards along the column leading to (10, 20) and (9, 20). \n3. I should move towards the egg located at (11, 23). \n\nI will take the action to move left to position (12, 3) next.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will allow me to close in on the explosive egg while avoiding immediate threats from the chickens.
