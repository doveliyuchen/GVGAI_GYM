There are no chickens currently visible, which allows me the opportunity to focus on collecting resources. \n\nWith my avatar's position remaining the same, it makes sense to take a step toward finding resources. Specifically, I will move towards the egg at (3, 21) on the next action.\n\n```Action: 2``` \n\nThis leftward movement will hopefully allow me to progress towards collecting an egg and aligns with the strategy of resource management while positioning myself for future interactions with any emerging threats."
