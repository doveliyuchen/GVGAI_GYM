It might be best to avoid direct approach.\n  \n- **Resources**:\n  - There are multiple eggs (both 'e' & '&') nearby that can be collected.\n  \n- **Walls and Structuring**:\n  - The space is well-structured with walls that can be used strategically to navigate around threats.\n\n### Strategic Actions:\n1. **Collect eggs**: Gaining explosive eggs will put you in a better position to combat chickens.\n2. **Avoid unnecessary combat**: Steer clear of fast chickens unless you are ready to fight effectively.\n3. **Stay safe**: Move towards the only direction where there's no immediate danger.\n\n### Movement Decision:\nFrom the current position (12, 1) the options are:\n- Move left (to (12, 0), a wall).\n- Move right (to (12, 2), empty space).\n- Use an egg (not currently applicable).\n- Do nothing (ACTION_NIL does not help).\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven the need to advance and not being able to interact with walls or eggs in my immediate move, the best action after analyzing is to:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis will move the avatar to position (12, 2) where it is safe and clears path towards collecting eggs nearby. \n\n### Expectation:\nThis action aligns with our strategy to gather resources and avoid combat, thus maintaining a safe pace in the game while positioning for future advantageous moves."
