Additionally, it should focus on moving towards coins and strategizing the elimination of boxes.\n\nGiven the current situation, the avatar can consider moving towards the coin at (1, 4) as a priority because it is relatively safe compared to risking proximity to the piranha.\n\nConsidering the avatar is currently not adjacent to any hazards or the piranha, moving up would bring the avatar closer to the coin without immediate threat.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar upward to (2, 4), positioning it closer to the coin, consistent with the strategy of maximizing coin collection while avoiding hazards."

In this situation, if I don't move away from the piranha, I will be defeated.\n\nTo ensure safety, I can either move left to (9,0) which is a wall or upwards to (8,1) which is accessible since it is empty ('.'). Since moving left isn\u2019t an option due to the wall, my only safe move is upwards.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to move away from the piranha and into a safe position. I expect that this aligns well with the strategy of avoiding hazards and ensuring my avatar's safety."
