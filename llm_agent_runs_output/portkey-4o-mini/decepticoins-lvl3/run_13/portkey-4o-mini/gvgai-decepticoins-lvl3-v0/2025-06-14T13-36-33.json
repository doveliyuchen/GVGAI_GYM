This means that the piranha is in range to attack if I don't move away from its vicinity.\n- The immediate goal is to navigate safely while also focusing on collecting boxes and coins, and avoiding the danger posed by the piranha.\n- The closest collectible item in this state is a coin at (1,4), but reaching it will require navigating away from the current position.\n\n### Move Options\n- Moving **DOWN** (Action 3) to (9,1) puts me next to the piranha, which is dangerous.\n- Moving **UP** (Action 4) goes to (7,1), still staying safe and moving away from the piranha.\n- Moving **LEFT** (Action 1) would move me to (8,0), which is blocked by a wall.\n- Moving **RIGHT** (Action 2) would put me in (8,2), which is also blocked by a wall.\n\nConsidering the threat from the piranha and determining to avoid confrontations, the best course of action is to move **UP** to position (7,1).\n\n### Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar safely away from the piranha and keeps options open for future moves while following the strategy of careful navigation."

This proximity means that movement options need to be calculated carefully to prevent getting caught by the piranha.\n- The adjacent spaces below the avatar (row 9) contain potential threats, with 'e' denoting the piranhas directly below the avatar in the same column.\n- The surrounding walls constrain movement, so the safest immediate action should be to either move left or right into open space.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven the avatar's current state and location:\n- **Moving directly down into row 9** would result in an immediate encounter with the piranhas, leading to a loss.\n- **Moving left (to (8, 0)) or right (to (8, 2))** are both valid options.
