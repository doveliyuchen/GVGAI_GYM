Depending on the avatar's surroundings, we should move towards the nearest butterfly (`@`) while being cautious of unvisited cocoon sprites (`#`). \n2. Moving into spaces that result in collision with a butterfly will lead to penalties, so calculating the safest path is key.\n3.

The avatar cannot move here.\n- **DOWN (8, 3)**: This position is a floor (`.`). The avatar can move here, but this does not bring the player closer to a butterfly.\n- **LEFT (7, 2)**: This position is a floor (`.`); the avatar can move here, but again it does not help in reaching the butterfly quickly.\n- **RIGHT (7, 4)**: This position is a floor (`.`) and does not lead to any immediate butterfly targets.\n\n### Best Choice:\nSince moving up is blocked by a wall and moving left or right does not yield any significant advance towards the butterflies located mainly in row 1 and row 2, while moving down is equally strategic but further from the butterflies, I will move **LEFT (7, 2)** hoping to position myself better for future moves towards a butterfly.\n\nGiven that this move can allow for repositioning and possible better subsequent actions, I will take the LEFT action. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action provides a cautious approach and aligns with map awareness strategy while avoiding any immediate collision with a butterfly.

The crucial elements include our avatar's position and the surrounding sprites.\n\n### Key Information:\n- Our avatar ('a') is currently located at (9, 13).\n- The immediate surroundings include:\n  - Walls ('$') surrounding our avatar on many sides.\n  - The nearest butterflies ('@') are in rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. \n- There are cocoon sprites ('#') present in rows 1 and 2, which we cannot leave unaddressed to avoid losing the game.\n\n### Strategy Recap:\nGiven the requirement to eliminate all butterflies and the negative impact of colliding with them, we need to devise a methodical approach. We should:\n1. Avoid touching the butterflies unless we can eliminate them.\n2. Ensure that we address the cocoon sprites to prevent loss.\n\n### Analyzing Immediate Moves:\n1. **Potential Moves from (9, 13)**:\n   - Up (8, 13): Results in a wall ($) \u2014 **blocked**.\n   - Down (10, 13): Results in a wall ($) \u2014 **blocked**.\n   - Left (9, 12): Results in an empty space (.) \u2014 **valid move**.\n   - Right (9, 14): Results in an empty space (.) \u2014 **valid move**.\n\nSince both left (9, 12) and right (9, 14) are options, we will need to pick one. Moving left (to (9, 12)) maintains proximity to the wall, allowing for potential next moves upward to manage the cocoon above and leftward directions.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI choose to move left to (9, 12).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move allows me to navigate towards the open space while planning to confront the cocoons more effectively in subsequent moves."

Avoid contact with butterflies while eliminating them.\n2. There are two cocoon sprites present in the level at (1, 1) and (1, 2). If any cocoon remains unaddressed after the game ends, it results in a loss.\n3. Coconuts can be used to strategically manipulate the butterfly count.\n\n**Next Moves Analysis**:\n- As I cannot move left, right, up, or down without encountering walls (blocked paths), the next move should ideally consider moving in a way that allows the interaction with butterflies.\n\nGiven that there are several nearby butterflies, I have to navigate my avatar closer to them while ensuring I'm moving in a direction that optimally allows for avoiding collisions. \n\nFrom the current position of my avatar (8, 5), the only available action is to move **up** (7, 5), since all other directions lead to walls or do not result in useful movement. \n\nThus, I will choose:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will strategically position me closer to possible interactions with the cocoon and butterflies above it, aligning myself to plan a response in the next turn."
