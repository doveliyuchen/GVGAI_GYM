Around your position, there are butterflies represented by '@' in various positions, and you are strategically trying to eliminate them to prevent their population from increasing via cocoons ('#').\n\nTo begin, the key objectives based on the analysis are:\n1. Focus on eliminating butterflies directly by moving towards them.\n2. Avoid letting butterflies reach cocoons to prevent cloning.\n\nAnalyzing the immediate surroundings:\n- You have multiple butterflies located at (row=7, col=6), (row=7, col=7), (row=8, col=6), (row=8, col=7), (row=8, col=20), (row=8, col=21), (row=4, col=20), (row=4, col=21), etc.\n- Given your current position (8, 14), you have a clear route to engage with butterflies at (8, 6) or (7, 6) and (7, 7).\n\nBased on the strategy to prioritize eliminating butterflies:\nI will move left to (8, 13), to position myself closer to the butterflies. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action moves me closer to the butterflies, and I expect to either encounter a butterfly or prepare myself for the next move towards engaging one in subsequent turns. This aligns with my strategy to manage the butterfly population effectively."
