However, to efficiently interact with butterflies nearby, the avatar may need to maneuver around the map, which mostly has a wall barrier in the first few rows.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nGiven that the avatar is at (7, 25) and appears to be surrounded mostly by empty spaces and a wall to the left, the most straightforward action is to move left to initiate a path towards the upper rows where butterflies are situated.\n\nI will take the action of moving left:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move will begin the journey towards engaging the nearby butterflies."

My expectation is that this will help remove barriers towards engaging butterflies effectively."

In the surrounding area, there are several butterflies ('@') positioned at (2, 19) and (2, 20), and there are some cocoons ('#') located in rows 1, 2, and 3 at various columns. \n\nTo achieve the win condition, I need to eliminate all cocoons while ensuring that all butterflies exist at the end of the game. Given the avatar's position and the surrounding items, an effective immediate action would be to first assess my ability to reach a butterfly or cocoon conveniently.\n\nSince (5, 18) is adjacent to (5, 19) (which is empty) and (5, 17) (which is empty), I should focus on maneuvering towards the nearest butterflies, which are located above me in row 2.\n\nTo enhance my position and to move closer to the butterflies:\n\n1. I could move up to (4, 18), but that doesn't get me closer to any targets.\n2. I could move down to (6, 18), but there are no targets there either.\n3. Left (5, 17) also does not lead to any useful positions.\n4. Right (5, 19) moves me into an empty space without significant advantage.\n\nInstead, calculating my options further shows that the only good action at this point, given the player perspective, is to **move up.** This would align me more closely towards the target area of the existing butterflies in row 2.\n\nThus, I will execute:\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis should help enhance my position, optimizing my next set of movements towards achieving the win condition. I expect to navigate upward toward the butterflies toward column 19 and 20 more effectively in subsequent actions."

There are two cocoons nearby at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 2). There are butterflies at (2, 19) and (3, 19) that are nearby.\n\nGiven that the initial position of your avatar hasn't changed from the last state, it\u2019s crucial to initiate movement towards an open space that may lead you to more interactions. There\u2019s no obstacle directly above, below, left, or right, providing flexibility.\n\nI will choose to move **up** to position (3, 18) since it does not bring me closer to any cocoon but allows continued exploration for potential butterfly engagement.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is aimed at exploring upward, paving the way for further movement towards the butterflies and potential interactions."
