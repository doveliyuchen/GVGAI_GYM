The strategy suggests prioritizing the elimination of butterflies while managing cocoons carefully. Since moving left (to (9, 3)), right (to (9, 5)), up (to (8, 4)), or down (to (10, 4)) has specific implications, let\u2019s analyze the immediate actions available.\n\n1. **Left (9, 3)**: The cell is empty (.). No butterflies or cocoons present, not because it directly helps eliminate a butterfly.\n  \n2. **Right (9, 5)**: The cell is also empty (.). Again, does not help eliminate a butterfly.\n\n3. **Up (8, 4)**: The cell is empty (.).\n\n4. **Down (10, 4)**: The cell is empty ($).\n\nYour avatar has no immediate movement towards butterflies from (9, 4) without a previous rotation indicated from prior actions. Therefore, you need to be strategic about how to move to access butterflies. \n\nSince your position hasn't changed, consider moving up (8, 4) to explore new areas and potential routes towards butterfly elimination. \n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up is strategically viable as it opens up potential new directions since both left and right remain empty. Plus, it keeps your options open for the next move towards neighboring areas where butterflies are present."

The closest butterflies are located at:\n- (row=4, col=16)\n- (row=8, col=16)\n- (row=9, col=16)\n\nMy next action should involve moving towards the butterflies while avoiding dead ends and planning for future interactions.\n\n### Suggested Action\nSince moving left (to row 8, col 6) and down (to row 9, col 7) presents no threats, I will choose to move **up** to (row 7, col 7), as this opens up new pathways upward and potentially towards eliminating butterflies in the next few moves.\n\n``` \nAction:4\n```\nThis move should help maneuver towards the upper area without risking contact with butterflies or cocoons at this stage.
