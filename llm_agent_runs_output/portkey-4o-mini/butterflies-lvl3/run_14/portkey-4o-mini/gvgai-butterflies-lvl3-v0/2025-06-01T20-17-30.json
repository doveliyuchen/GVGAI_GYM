Moving strategically to a position that could allow for eliminating butterflies safely near the cocoon (`#`) is key while also keeping distance to avoid contact with them.\n- Since there are multiple butterflies in various areas, the avatar needs to seek a position to lure or deal with them without colliding.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- The avatar can move **left** to (8, 8), **right** to (8, 10), **up** to (7, 9), or **down** to (9, 9). All available directions lead away from immediate danger since no butterflies are close enough to be a direct threat.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\nMoving **up (to 7, 9)** keeps the avatar in a more centralized position away from butterflies yet close enough to take action on nearby ones in the next turns. This can keep an eye on their positions while also ensuring the cocoon\u2019s safety and possible control.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis move allows me to maintain distance from the butterflies and reassess the situation on the next move, which is aligned with the objective to strategize avoiding contact while trying to control the butterfly count."

The avatar is located at (8, 1) next to a wall on the left, with plenty of space to the right and below.\n\n### Strategy Recap\nThe primary objectives are:\n1. Eliminate as many butterflies as possible while avoiding contact with them.\n2. Ensure the cocoon remains safe.\n\n### Butterflies Nearby\n- There are butterflies located at coordinates:\n  - (1, 10)\n  - (1, 11)\n  - (2, 10)\n  - (2, 11)\n  - (2, 19)\n  - (2, 20)\n  - (7, 23)\n\nThe nearest butterfly is at (2, 10). The avatar (8, 1) cannot directly interact with the butterfly but can move towards positions that allow for strategic interactions.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe available actions do not directly indicate a move towards any butterfly that we can successfully eliminate while keeping the cocoon safe. Given the wall to the left and open space towards the right and downward, moving downward might help us reach a better position to interact with butterflies.\n\n### Action Decision\nI'll move down from (8, 1) to (9, 1) to explore more options and potentially prepare a path towards capturing or eliminating butterflies in the next turns.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nMoving down is expected to provide more flexibility and lessen immediate threats from butterflies while scouting for potential targets."

Thus, moving up towards the cocoon will give us a strategic advantage while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\n**Feedback**: The action moves the avatar up toward a cocoon, avoiding butterflies and positioning strategically to manage the game effectively.
