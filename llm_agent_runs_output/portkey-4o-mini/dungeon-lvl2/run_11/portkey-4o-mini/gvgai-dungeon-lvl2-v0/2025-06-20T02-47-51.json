The optimal path is typically to scout adjacent spaces for any immediate resources while remaining cautious of hazards.\n\n### Next Action Selection:\nSince the avatar is stationary (if we did not move last turn), we should consider moving in a direction that leads towards either a key (if we want to unlock anything) or ideally towards the exit.\n\nGiven the layout around the avatar, let's first examine its immediate neighbors:\n- (4, 14): 'k' (key)\n- (5, 13): '.'

Move towards the right (to (2, 4)), as this opens up more space for exploration.\n2. After evaluating the next step, I can make more informed decisions based on the entities around me.\n\n### Action Decision\nI will proceed with the action of moving RIGHT as my first move:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action enables exploration towards undefined options that may lead towards resource collection or an exit strategy, aligning with the advice to thoroughly explore and manage resources effectively."
