Moving vertically towards the exit is important, but since I cannot move directly down towards the lock without a proper key, I should instead move horizontally to collect a key.\n\n### Decision\nMoving left to (6, 11) to collect another key seems like a sound choice, as it increases resources while keeping my avatar safe. \n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left not only contributes to key collection but also strategically positions me closer to additional resources on this row. I expect this aligns with the strategy to gather keys while avoiding immediate hazards."
