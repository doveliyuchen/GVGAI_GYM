The **immediate objective** should be to collect resources (keys and gold) and avoid hazards.\n2. **Health preservation** is crucial; hence moving around fireholes and other dangerous traps must be carefully evaluated.\n3. **Path Planning**: The avatar should move towards spots that maximize resource collection while minimizing exposure to hazards.\n\n### Actions Available:\nThe available actions in the upward direction would suggest trying to access the gold or key on the next moves.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the next logical step is:\n\n- **Move Right** to position `(6, 15)`, which is safe and within the grid, while also getting closer to the beneficial areas (like collecting gold).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThe expectation is to avoid hazards and start resource collection smoothly."
