This would allow for further movement towards the exit (next possible moves towards columns 10, and then upwards towards row 19 if deemed safe).\n\n### Expected Outcome\nMoving right is a strategic choice that keeps various options open for subsequent moves without encountering immediate hazards. \n\n**Action Decision:**\nMoving right to (row 18, column 9) before considering any further navigational strategies should be the first step.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should successfully translate into an advantageous position while ensuring the avatar doesn't encounter a wall or trap."
