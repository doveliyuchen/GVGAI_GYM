The restrictions cause a limitation, as movement options are narrow.\n\n### Evaluation of Next Actions:\nThe only logical action that will enable movement toward potential interaction with obstacles or found resources is moving down or to the left, which aren\u2019t open, thus:\n\nGiven that the left and down options are walls, and the right may need the avatar to rotate before moving it again, we will keep evaluating.\n\nSince the avatar's position is unchanged through potential proposed movements so far, and considering it\u2019s surrounded, I shall attempt to rotate right as logical first action since that opens potential for movement to exploration.\n\nI will proceed with the next action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy in terms of assessing movement options.

The immediate surroundings include walls (`l`) to the left, right, and below, making it essential to move thoughtfully to avoid hazards and maximize score collection.\n\n### Strategy Execution\n1. **Resource Management:** \n   - I am prioritizing the collection of gold and ensuring I have sufficient keys for potential doors (though I do not see any locks nearby).\n  \n2. **Hazard Awareness:**\n   - Be mindful of movement to avoid walls and traps while aiming for gold.\n  \n3. **Path Planning:**\n   - As (6, 16) is a wall on the left, my next logical move would be to explore adjacent positions where gold is collectible without moving into hazards.\n\nGiven that the position hasn't changed from the last action and I need to choose a movement that can reposition my avatar effectively:\n\nI will move **UP** to (5, 16).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will allow me to explore upward, moving towards potential pathways where I can gather resources more effectively while avoiding hazards."
