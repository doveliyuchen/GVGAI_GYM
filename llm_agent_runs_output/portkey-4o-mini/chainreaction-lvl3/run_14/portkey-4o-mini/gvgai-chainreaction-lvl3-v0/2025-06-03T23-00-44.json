Surrounding the avatar, we must consider the obstacles, hazards, and objectives nearby:\n\n- (8, 8): Wall (`&`)\n- (8, 10): Floor (`.`)\n- (7, 9): Goal (`@`)\n- (9, 9): Wall (`&`)\n\nThe immediate options for the avatar are to move up to (7, 9) to reach a goal or to move right to (8, 10). Given that heading up (to (7, 9)) will directly allow the avatar to reach the goal (`@`), it seems the best course of action.\n\nHence, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up to the goal, achieving a direct objective and aligning with the strategy of making progress toward clearing the level."

The immediate actions we can consider are moving the avatar left (to (7, 8)), right (to (7, 10)), up (to (6, 9)), or down (to (8, 9)).\n\n### Current Layout Analysis:\n- **Left (7, 8)**: There is a floor tile (.), so the avatar can move there.\n- **Right (7, 10)**: There is a goal tile (@), which means moving there would be beneficial as it contributes to clearing a level target and could increase score.\n- **Up (6, 9)**: There is a floor tile (.) allowing movement.\n- **Down (8, 9)**: There is a floor tile (.), allowing movement.\n\nBased on the immediate options, it makes the most strategic sense to move the avatar to the right towards the goal tile (7, 10).\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to (7, 10) places the avatar on a goal tile, which helps in progressing towards the completion of the level and aligning with the strategy of clearing goals for score."
