There are various obstacles, goals, and boulders on the grid that will affect your movement and overall strategy. Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis to determine the next best action:\n\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: (7, 4) - The avatar is surrounded by several entities, including:\n   - An `@` goal at (7, 10)\n   - A `$` (masterBoulder) at (7, 3)\n   - Some holes (`#`) at (4, 9) and (4, 11)\n   - Walls (`&`) and other terrains are present throughout the map.\n\n2. **Possible Actions**:\n   - **LEFT (ACTION_LEFT)**: This would move the avatar to (7, 3) where the `$` (masterBoulder) is located.\n   - **RIGHT (ACTION_RIGHT)**: Move to (7, 5), which is a floor (empty space).\n   - **DOWN (ACTION_DOWN)**: Move to (8, 4), which is also a floor (empty space).\n   - **UP (ACTION_UP)**: Move to (6, 4), where it is a normal boulder (`%`).\n\n3. **Choosing an Action**:\n   Since the goal is to remove target boulders while also moving towards the goal (`@` at (7, 10)), it seems prudent to keep the options open while minimizing negative interactions. Moving left to (7, 3) could engage the `masterBoulder`, but if you already have 0 avatar left, it could be dangerous, given the win/loss conditions of removing master boulders or losing all avatars.\n\nInstead, moving **RIGHT** to (7, 5) would allow for safer movement across the board without immediate danger from obstacles or master boulders.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\n**Feedback**: Moving right opens up more movement options without engaging with potentially hazardous boulders just yet, aligning with the overall strategy of managing interactions wisely to reach the goal."

Moving to the left towards (7, 4) seems to open up more options (as it\u2019s an empty space).\n2. Alternatively, moving down to (8, 5) will remain within safe territory, still allowing movement towards next objectives.\n\nSince the last action may not have resulted in any movement (since I didn't act yet), I should execute an action to progress further.\n\n### Available Action\nBased on the strategic evaluation, I will choose to move **left** to make progress. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis should help me explore additional areas, and I'm looking forward to possibly locating the nearest goal on the next move."

The avatar is near a row with several empty floor spaces, the hole in (4, 9), and boulders in (3, 3).\n  \n- **Strategic Focus**: We need to move the avatar towards the goals while avoiding the hole to prevent score loss.

To the immediate left (3, 1) and right (3, 3) are free spaces, while above (2, 2) is a box and below (4, 2) is empty. There's also a normal boulder to the right at (3, 3).\n\n2. **Goals and Hazards**: The nearest goal is down at (7, 10), with obstacles that need to be navigated around, especially since there are holes at (4, 9) and (4, 11).\n\n3. **Potential Actions**: \n   - Moving left to (3, 1) would bring us to a free space.\n   - Moving right to (3, 3) puts us next to a normal boulder.\n   - Moving up to (2, 2) will hit a box, and down to (4, 2) is also free.\n\n4. **Strategic Considerations**: Moving towards the right to (3, 3) makes sense as it opens up the possibility to push the normal boulder further into the layout. This could potentially create an advantage towards clearing out sections and moving toward the goal. \n\nContinuing this logic, if I decide to move right into that space, I could then analyze the next position further.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my action will be:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, to position (3, 3), where it can interact with the normal boulder in future moves, aligning with the strategy of boulder management and moving towards the goals."

Yet, the presence of the normal boulder there suggests a potential push which could lead to advantageous transformations later.\n\nHowever, considering that the objective is to continuously make meaningful progress towards the goal while managing the boulders and ensuring that the avatar can keep moving, moving downward (to 4, 2) may open more routes towards the eventual goal while not making immediate contact with a boulder.\n\nThus, the best strategic move given the current state is to go down.\n\n### Action Selection:\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action will help move the avatar closer to more open paths toward the goal while still keeping options open for future turns."

The proximity to boulders and holes needs to be carefully watched.\n   \n2. **Current State Review**: Since the avatar did not move from its last state (presumably from previous input), it indicates that the last action either caused a rotation or resulted in no movement. The player needs to choose a directional action that will attempt to navigate without leading to collisions with non-movable walls or hazards.\n\n### Next Action Decision:\n1. The goal is still a few rows up, and there are multiple paths, but careful moves are required in the presence of walls and hazards.\n\nAssessing the potential immediate actions:\n- **Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: Moving left (to 7, 9) is a clear space.\n- **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: This brings the avatar to (7, 11) which is also a free space.\n- **Up (ACTION_UP)**: Moving up to (6, 10) is also clear.\n- **Down (ACTION_DOWN)**: This leads to (8, 10) which is free as well.\n\nTo maximize the next move towards strategic play and to avoid lingering in your position without moving, I will make the decision to move **up** towards a new row while monitoring for any immediate interactions that provide a better chance to work towards the goal.\n\n```Action: 4```\n\nThis action expects to reposition upwards while avoiding walls or immediate hazards as a turn is taken.

I need to analyze the area around my avatar to determine the best action to take while adhering to the game's rules. \n\n### Nearby Layout Analysis:\n\n- **To the left (col 9)**: This position has a `.` (floor), which is clear.\n- **To the right (col 11)**: This position has a `&` (wall), which means I cannot move there.\n- **Above (row 1, col 10)**: This position also contains a `b` (box floor), meaning I can move there.\n- **Below (row 3, col 10)**: This position has a `.` (floor), which is clear.\n\nSince my avatar's previous position will not change significantly, I'll attempt to move my avatar either above (row 1, col 10) or below (row 3, col 10) on my next move.\n\nGiven the available actions, it looks like I have the option to move either up to row 1, col 10 or down to row 3, col 10.\n\n### Decision Making:\nMoving up to (1, 10) is unblocked but leads me to a box floor, which means I could get stuck. Conversely, moving down to (3, 10) is also a viable option since it is clear and keeps my avatar closer to potential action (goal positions at (3, 2) and (7, 10)).\n\n### Chosen Action\nI will choose to move down. \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of advancing towards my goals while avoiding potential blocking from the box on row 1. My expectation is to reposition my avatar closer to a more favorable scenario while maintaining an option to act towards the goals ahead."

The goals you need to reach are represented by `@`, which can be found at positions (3, 2) and (7, 10). The state of the grid shows you surrounded by various obstacles and potential paths.\n\nTo determine the best action, let's analyze the surrounding positions:\n\n1. **Direct Path to Goal**: The first goal (3, 2) is west of your current position. However, there are a couple of boxes (`b`) and a normal boulder (`%`) to navigate around.\n  \n2. **Other Goal**: The second goal (7, 10) is directly below you at (7, 10), but there seems to be no immediate obstacle to it.\n\n3. **Available space**: Moving further down (to (4, 10)) is also an option with no obstacles.\n\nTo align with the strategy of planning moves carefully, avoiding hazards, and utilizing available paths to reach a goal, the next logical move is to move down toward (4, 10), as it brings your avatar closer to a goal without immediate risk.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```  \nThis action is expected to navigate a clear path, helping progress toward the available goal at (7, 10) directly below."
