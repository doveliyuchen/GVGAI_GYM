There are several interactive elements around you, particularly boxes and boulders, as well as goals and holes that you need to navigate.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The immediate area around the avatar in row 8 includes walls (row 7, col 7 and row 8, col 7), and it also seems to have empty floor tiles with some boxes located above (e.g., row 7, col 10; row 6, col 4 and col 13).\n- There are target boulders (indicated by '%') located at (row 3, col 3) and (row 3, col 8).\n- There are holes on the floor at (row 4, col 9) and (row 4, col 11) that need to be avoided.\n\n### Potential Movements:\n1. **If I move LEFT (ACTION_LEFT)**: The avatar would move to (row 8, col 2). However, there is nothing immediately beneficial in this direction since it is a plain floor tile.\n2. **If I move RIGHT (ACTION_RIGHT)**: The avatar would move to (row 8, col 4). This also leads to a plain floor tile but opens the possibility to explore further right.\n3. **If I move UP (ACTION_UP)**: The avatar would move to (row 7, col 3). This is again a plain tile but allows looking for more strategic routes.\n4. **If I move DOWN (ACTION_DOWN)**: The avatar would move to (row 9, col 3). However, this direction leads to a wall and isn't a valid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince moving DOWN is invalid, moving LEFT doesn\u2019t seem to lead to any advantage, and both moving UP leads to more open space to explore whereas moving RIGHT keeps options to further explore the right side open. \n\nConsidering the strategy to maximize movement and possibly maneuver toward goals, I will choose to move **UP** (ACTION_UP) to explore more options in the upper row.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to put me in a better position to either manipulate boxes or further explore adjacent spaces while being cautious of the boulders and holes."
