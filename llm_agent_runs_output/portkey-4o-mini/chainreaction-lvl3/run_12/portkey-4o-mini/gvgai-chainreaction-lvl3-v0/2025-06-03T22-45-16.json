The goal (`@`) is located at (row=3, col=2) and (row=7, col=10), indicating that we may need to move towards these areas at some point.\n3.

The immediate actions are:\n\n- Moving **UP** to (7, 4) will take the avatar closer to the master boulder at (7, 3).\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** does not present any obstacles but maintains the avatar's distance from the main action area (goals and boulders).\n- Moving **DOWN** to (9, 4) would bring the avatar to the bottom wall row which does not seem beneficial.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nGiven that moving **UP** places the avatar closer to useful objects without hitting walls or holes, it is the most advantageous move.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nFeedback: I chose to move UP in order to better position the avatar for potential interactions with the master boulder directly above, aligning with our strategy of planning moves that lead to transformations and progress towards the goal."

The primary target for gameplay is to convert normal boulders ('%') into master boulders ('$') or target boulders while avoiding obstacles like holes ('#') or walls ('&').\n\nIn this instance, the boulders are positioned as follows:\n- Normal boulders ('%') are located at (3, 3), (3, 8), and (6, 4).\n- Master boulders ('$') are at (3, 14) and (7, 1).\n\nThe goal ('@') is located at (3, 2) and (7, 10).\n\n### Next Move:\nCurrently, I can see a normal boulder nearby at (3, 3). The immediate goal is to potentially push or interact with the boulders and work toward transforming them.\n\nConsidering the distances, my next action should pivot towards interacting with nearby boulders efficiently. Since my avatar is facing down (since the action would happen if positioned correctly), I can push boulders more effectively via the actions available.\n\nThus, I will decide to move **DOWN** to (6, 5). This action does not directly interact with boulders but positions me closer to the normal boulders nearby.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down to explore for available normal boulders and set up for potential next interactions aligns with the strategy of securing advantageous positions."
