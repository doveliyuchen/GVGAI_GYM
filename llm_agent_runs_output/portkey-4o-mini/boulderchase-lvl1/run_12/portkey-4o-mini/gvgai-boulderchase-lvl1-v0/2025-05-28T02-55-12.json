Moving left to (11, 2) is safe as it is just empty background but does not lead to a resource.\n2. Moving up to (10, 3) will also leave me in an empty background, giving me potentially more options in the next turn since I can then either go left to (10, 2), right to (10, 4), or further up to (9, 3).\n\nThe only productive move seems to be moving up as it opens more paths rather than just moving left.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nI expect this action to provide me with more options in the next turn, supporting a strategic approach to resource gathering and avoiding enemies."

The immediate surroundings consist of a boulder ('@') at (11, 4), a diamond ('%') at (11, 5), and various empty dirt cells.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- **Current Position**: (11, 3)\n- **Next Cell (11, 4)**: Contains a boulder ('@'), which is a hazard. \n- **Next Right Cell (11, 5)**: Contains a diamond ('%'), which is desirable.\n\nGiven that moving right is blocked by a boulder, I can only move down to (12, 3) which is a wall ('b') or move left or up to try and find a clearer path. However, the surrounding cells are walls or boulders, meaning a left or up move will also not provide immediate access to resources or paths.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nSince the main objective is to reach the exit after collecting diamonds while avoiding hazards, and my current position does not allow for a positive change, I must determine whether to perform an action that gives me a chance to move or rather assess the strategic path that will allow me to eventually find the exit while still potentially collecting diamonds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt this stage, I will choose to take the action to move **up**, as it provides a new perspective of the environment and might open new paths.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action should allow me to understand better the surrounding map while adhering to my strategy of finding a way to avoid hazards and encounter resources."
