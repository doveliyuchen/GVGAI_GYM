You are surrounded by background dirt on either side (col 4 and col 6) and other items are mostly below you.\n\nTo proceed with the strategy of resource management and avoiding enemy encounters, I suggest the following actions. First, there are diamonds around your position that can be collected. However, since you have no information regarding your current diamond count, we must be cautious not to collect too many.\n\nThe available transformative actions are:\n- I could move **left** to (9, 4) where there is dirt but I can't collect anything.\n- I could move **down** to (10, 5) where there is a boulder.\n- I could move **right** to (9, 6) where there is also dirt.\n\nSince I\u2019ve learned that action 0 does not affect anything, I will move **down** to (10, 5). \n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nMoving down could potentially lead to new paths to explore for diamonds or safe routes to collect resources while stepping away from potential threats like crabs on row 2."

It's important to survey what's immediately present to determine the best course of action.\n\n### Observations:\n- Diamonds are present at (1, 22), (2, 20), (2, 24), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 19), and so on.\n- The exit door is located at a dedicated exit location (b), which we should eventually try to reach.\n- The player must keep their diamond count below 9 to exit the level. \n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Collect Diamonds**: The avatar should attempt to collect diamonds while ensuring there\u2019s still room to move towards the exit.\n2. **Combat Strategy**: Avoid combat with enemies unless beneficial for eliminating them (for example, dropping boulders on them).\n3. **Movement**: The avatar will likely need to navigate through spaces with minimal enemy encounter while calculating approaching allies and enemies.\n\n### Potential Movements:\n- Given the immediate surroundings, right now, the best diamond opportunity seems to be (5, 9) which is down the row; thus if we go **down** towards the diamond, we can attempt to collect the diamond without engaging enemies directly.\n\n### Action Execution:\n``` \nAction:4 \n```\nThis action moves the avatar down, allowing it to position itself towards the diamond while evaluating other options for future turns. My expectation is to align with the strategy of collecting diamonds while being cautious of nearby enemies."
