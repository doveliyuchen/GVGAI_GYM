There are several relevant enemies and bullets spread throughout the map, which makes careful positioning essential.\n\n**Analysis of Immediate Surroundings:**\n- Enemies:\n  - The closest enemy is a `chaseEnemy` at (row=1, col=1) and (row=4, col=4). This enemy actively chases my avatar if it gets too close.\n  - I see a `dirEnemy` at (row=2, col=14), which will shoot projectiles when I get within range.\n  - There are also a few random enemies and other spawners scattered across the map.\n\n**Current Strategy Overview:**\n1. I should prioritize either moving to avoid the `chaseEnemy` or eliminating immediate threats nearby.\n2. My goal is to stay clear from enemies while maximizing my chances of destroying them with my cannon.\n\n**Next Move Decision:**\nConsidering that I'm currently located at (row=10, col=4), I will aim to move closer vertically to improve my engagement options against the enemies while being cautious of my route.\n\nI will choose to move **UP** to (row=9, col=4) as my first step.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move brings me closer to the potential spawning areas of enemies on the upper rows, allowing me to engage once I properly assess the situation. I expect to see either enemy spawns in my vicinity or a chance to shoot down an enemy from a strategic position."
