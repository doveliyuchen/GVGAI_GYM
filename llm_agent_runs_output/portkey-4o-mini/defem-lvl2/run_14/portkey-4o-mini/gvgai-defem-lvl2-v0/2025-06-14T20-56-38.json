Staying mobile will make it harder for enemies to target or damage me.\n- **Cannon Use**: Given that I have access to a cannon nearby, I can also take a moment to activate it, though I can't see immediate threats from its location right now.\n- **Prioritize Threats**: The closest immediate threat is the chase enemy directly south (row 10, col 2). To avoid being chased and cornered, moving left toward an open area could be beneficial.\n\n### Action\n1. Since my avatar's position hasn't changed recently and considering the \"rotation then move\" mechanic, I need to move my avatar to a safer location away from threats.\n2. The best move is to go left (col 7), which should both distance me from the chase enemy and allow for potential strategic movement options.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will help position my avatar away from immediate threats while keeping space to navigate further in the game."
