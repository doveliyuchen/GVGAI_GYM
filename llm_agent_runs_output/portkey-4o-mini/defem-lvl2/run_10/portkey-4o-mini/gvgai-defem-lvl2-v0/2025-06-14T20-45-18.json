Several enemy types are present on the map, particularly:\n   - **Chaser** enemies represented by '@', which are particularly dangerous as they will pursue my avatar.\n   - Other enemies such as '$' and '%' which also need to be dealt with.\n\n2. My avatar is currently positioned in the middle and I have some distance from certain enemies but need to be aware of chasers potentially moving towards me.\n\nSince my last position hasn't changed after a possible directional action (I am still at row 6, col 9), I need to first move and avoid being pursued or cornered by my enemies. Also, it\u2019s essential to maintain a good distance from the chaser enemies while taking control of the battlefield.\n\n**Analysis of Available Directions**:\n- Moving **LEFT (col 8)** could put me closer to some chasers.\n- Moving **RIGHT (col 10)** or **UP (row 5)** may be safer options.\n- Moving **DOWN (row 7)** does not yield any immediate threats and keeps me safe.\n\nTherefore, I will move **DOWN** to (row 7, col 9).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down keeps me away from immediate threats and allows for a better positioning strategy against the various enemies. I expect that after this action, I will have a clearer view of the enemy movements and can respond accordingly on my next turn."

There are also several directional enemies. \n3. **Spawn Points**: The spawn points, such as 's' (defined at multiple locations across the map), can produce chaser enemies if not dealt with.\n\nGiven that the avatar needs to minimize the threat, especially from the chaser enemies that will actively pursue, it is crucial to maintain distance while finding bullets and planning shots.\n\n### Current Strategy Suggestion:\n1. **Avoid Nearby Threats**: Move away from the right side where a chaser is not currently present, while also needing to check for nearby bullets.\n2. **Action Decision**: Move UP (to (6,7)) to avoid being cornered with the current threats while also staying near enemies spawn points for potential engagements later.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action will allow the avatar to reposition safely and potentially collect more bullets while avoiding immediate threats.
