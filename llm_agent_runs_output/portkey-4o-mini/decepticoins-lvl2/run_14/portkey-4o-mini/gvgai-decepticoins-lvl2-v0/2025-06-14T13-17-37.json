The avatar cannot move left (due to wall), can move right to (3, 6).\n2. There is a coin nearby at (5, 29) that can be useful to collect later.\n3. The avatar needs to navigate carefully, as the overall goal is to clear boxes and avoid hazards.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nSince moving left or down is blocked, I can either:\n- Move right to row 3, col 6.\n- Execute a movement to explore more area.\n\nBased on the current state, the best immediate action is to move right to row 3, column 6 to explore more of the level.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to move right and potentially uncover more pathways or collectibles while staying safe from hazards.

The immediate surroundings consist of a mix of floor tiles (.), holes (0), boxes (@), and the walls (w).\n\nThe key observations are:\n- There are two holes (0) adjacent to the avatar at (row=8, col=15) and (row=8, col=17), which are dangerous areas where stepping results in losing the game.\n- To the left at (row=8, col=17) is a box (@) that can potentially be moved to aid in navigate the level.\n- The primary goal is to clear all boxes, and the only available box is at (row=8, col=16).\n\nGiven the situation and the avatar's surroundings, a strategic response would be to move to the left (position (row=8, col=17)) to step on the box. This will help in clearing the box and also aid in future movements, considering that adjacent to this position is a hole.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move left:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is expected to facilitate box interactions while avoiding danger from the holes immediately next to the current position."

However, since the objective is to clear all boxes and the next logical way to achieve that is to use the box.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action is to move left towards the box.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy to explore the environment and utilize the box effectively while keeping the avatar safe from the walls and potential threats."
