The immediate strategy is to avoid monsters and attempt to navigate towards the gems or gold.\n\nBased on the possible actions:\n\n- Moving **Left** to (row=13, col=8) will keep you on an empty tile and move towards open space.\n- Moving **Right** to (row=13, col=10) also lands you on an empty tile but moves you slightly further away from the direction where the goodies are located.\n- Moving **Up** to (row=12, col=9) lands on an empty space as well, offering further paths to explore.\n- Moving **Down** to (row=14, col=9) keeps you on an empty tile but is not progressing towards any items.\n\nSince I need to analyze the paths and avoid monsters, I will choose to move **Left** to explore the open space while repositioning strategically.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will help in analyzing the situation further and potentially prepare for collecting items in future turns after assessing the area ahead."

Moving **left (ACTION_LEFT)** would lead to (14, 5), which is empty but does not lead towards any goodies.\n2. Moving **right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (14, 7) is also empty, similar to action left.\n3. Moving **up (ACTION_UP)** to (13, 6) is also an empty space with no significant interaction.\n4.

Among the four directions available, all are the same in terms of offering no immediate success.\n2. Since there is no risk of monsters at the avatar's current location, and any direction leads only to further empty spaces, maintaining and checking any next strategic path seems vital.\n\nLet's opt for a movement that may lead toward future strategic exploration:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will maintain a line of movement downwards potentially promoting access to more items while keeping future options open."
