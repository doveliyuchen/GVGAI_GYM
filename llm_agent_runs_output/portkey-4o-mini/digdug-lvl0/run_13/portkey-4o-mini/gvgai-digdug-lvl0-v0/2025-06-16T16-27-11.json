(empty space)\n\nFrom the analysis, the avatar can only move up, left, or right since moving down is blocked by a wall.\n\n2. **Goal:**\n   - The main goal is to gather all the goodies while avoiding the monsters. The remaining goodies in close proximity include several gems and gold in our current vicinity:\n     - Gems at:\n       - (row 4, col 9) -> '#'\n       - (row 5, col 3) -> '#'\n       - (row 5, col 18) -> '#'\n       - (row 6, col 4) -> '#'\n       - (row 7, col 2) -> '#'\n     - Gold at:\n       - (row 2, col 18) -> '$'\n       - (row 3, col 9) -> '$'\n       - (row 4, col 4) -> '$'\n       - (row 7, col 12) -> '$'\n       - (row 10, col 11) -> '$'\n       - (row 10, col 12) -> 'b' (monster guarding, can be dangerous)\n\n3. **Next Move Strategy:**\n   - The preferable move would be to collect nearby goodies while avoiding any monsters. Since monsters can harm the avatar, we need to prioritize safety and movement towards items while not moving into a dangerous location.\n\nGiven the available actions, I will move **UP** to (row 12, col 8), which is a safe move to an adjacent empty space.\n\n```Action: 5```\n\nFeedback: Moving up to (row 12, col 8) keeps the avatar safe while positioning closer to potentially valuable items in the subsequent moves. I anticipate assessing the next options after this move to continue towards gathering gems or gold while avoiding monsters."

Surrounding the avatar, we see the following relevant sprites:\n\n- Directly to the left (14, 7) and right (14, 9) are walls ('&'), creating a barrier.\n- Above (13, 8) is a resting sprite ('r'), which does not pose a threat.\n- Below (15, 8) is a wall ('&').\n- Above (13, 8) to the left (13, 7) is a floor ('.').\n- Above (13, 8) to the right (13, 9) is also a floor ('.').\n\nEssentially, the avatar cannot move left or right due to walls, and cannot move down due to another wall below it. The only available movement is to interact with the boulders or use the shovel if it possesses one.\n\nTaking this into account, since the avatar is currently stationary and needs to take action, there are no viable move options. Without the shovel or other collectibles available at its current position, the action that best suits the situation is to take a closer look at the options.\n\nSince no movement can occur and the only action possibility is to interact (if able) with an existing object, the best course to make a decision about the next move is simply to indicate no action is necessary at this time.\n\n``` Action:0 ```\nThe feedback on this action is that it highlights the current inability to change the position due to obstacles, which prevents any immediate movement in the game environment.
