The area around the avatar at (13, 15) is likely clear of immediate threats since I have a wall (represented by '&') to my left and I know there are no monsters or dangerous items nearby based on the given sprite mapping.\n2. The exit is at (1, 5), which is in a different row and requires navigating through the map while optimizing paths to collect goodies along the way.\n\n### Current Actions:\n- The moves available that could potentially yield progress are Up (to row 12, col 15), Down (to row 14, col 15), Left (to row 13, col 14), and Right (to row 13, col 16). However, the left (col 14 is a wall), right (col 16 is empty), and down (row 14 col 15 is empty) options seem promising, while moving up could lead to limited options as row 12 also has walls adjacent.\n\nTo optimize movement and increase the chances of collecting goodies while minimizing risk, I will move **Right** to (13, 16).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right to (13, 16) places my avatar in an empty cell, allowing future exploration options without confrontation. This aligns with my strategy of navigating safely while keeping an eye for collectibles toward the exit goal."
