The closest monster is at (13, 22).\n\nFor effective movement and to satisfy the strategic rules:\n- I see that the avatar is currently standing vertically aligned to several collectible items.\n- We want to move towards collectibles while navigating around any nearby monsters.\n\nLet's analyze the actions:\n- Moving left or right will not yield any collectible items.\n- Moving down to (14, 8) keeps the avatar clear of danger, and there are no collectibles directly in that direction; thus this option can be avoided in search of goodies.\n- Moving up to (12, 8) also does not result in collecting cookies, but could open up additional routes to explore near other goodies.\n\nI determine the best action is to move **up**, towards (12, 8), to evaluate the next move opportunities that may arise from that position.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action would allow us to get to (12, 8), and we can reassess the surrounding area for the next turn effectively. It aligns with the strategy to strategically navigate while preserving the option to collect nearby goodies."

This move does not result in any immediate threat from monsters and keeps the opportunity to explore the neighboring paths open.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis allows me to continue exploring and gathering resources while remaining cautious of surrounding monsters."
