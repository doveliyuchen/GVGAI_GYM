A right move towards the monster seems risky unless planning to engage directly, which we want to avoid at this point.\n\nI will check for movement options:\n1. **Left (Action 2)**: \n   - Move to `(13, 7)`, still not approaching any collectible.\n  \n2. **Right (Action 3)**: \n   - Move to `(13, 9)`, which moves towards a safe area and can help assess options.\n  \n3. **Up (Action 5)** and **Down (Action 4)**: \n   - Both will take the avatar out of the row with the monster.\n\n### Decision:\nA right move might be better to assess surroundings, but with no beneficial tiles there, it\u2019s best to retreat temporarily to avoid confrontation without gains.\n\nGiven the above considerations, I will execute:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nMoving left to avoid direct confrontation but staying aware of options to strategize for collecting goods or fighting monsters later.

Based on the map, moving towards the collectables while trying to outmaneuver the enemies seems like the best course of action.\n\nSince the avatar's position has not changed based on action inputs, I will need to execute a movement action explicitly to ensure progress.\n\n### Next Move:\n- I will move **down** from (13, 3) to (14, 3), as moving down does not place the avatar in immediate danger while setting the stage to approach the gem at (5, 3) later on.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move is expected to keep me away from immediate threats and position me closer to areas with gatherable goodies."

Moving towards empty spaces should help in planning future moves to collect goodies (gold or gems).\n\n### Chosen Action\nMoving to the right (row=13, col=8) is safer since it keeps the avatar away from the direct threat of enemies.\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow the avatar to explore new space while minimizing risk.

You will need to focus on getting your avatar ready to navigate toward collectibles. Since you are not currently adjacent to an interactable item, I will proceed with a simple directional movement.\n\n```Action: ACTION_UP```\n\nThis action is chosen to move upward (the only valid option to explore new potential locations) and hopefully put you in a position to plan further moves towards goodies without encountering walls. My expectation is that moving up will either allow a position change or give insight into future options to gather goodies."

The only available adjacent positions are up and down, where both positions are free spaces (`.`).\n\n### Strategy Application:\nThe immediate strategy would be to explore the surroundings to collect more resources or navigate to other items (gold, gems). Moving either up or down could potentially lead to new paths, but for now, both directions are suitable since they are free spaces.\n\nGiven that moving down also keeps the option to explore further available and could potentially lead toward areas that might yield items (gold or gems), I will choose to move **down**.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will allow me to explore further beneath my current position, keeping in line with the strategy of resource gathering. I expect this to bring me closer to more lucrative areas."
