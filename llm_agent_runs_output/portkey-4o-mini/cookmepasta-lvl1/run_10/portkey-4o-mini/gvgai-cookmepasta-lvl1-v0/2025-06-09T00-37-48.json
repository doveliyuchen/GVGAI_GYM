Interactions and movements:\n   - The goal is to collect the key and possibly interact with boiling water and raw pasta to create a pasta dish.\n   - The key (`#`) is directly above in the current column but at the coordinates `(9, 5)`, which is blocked by walls on both sides.\n  \n### Action Decision:\nGiven that the avatar is currently at position `(9, 12)` and must first move to (or interact with) the key `(9, 5)`, I can choose to move left, but since `(9, 5)` is actually a wall, the next actionable movements require an alternative approach.\n\nSince I cannot move to the left due to being blocked by the wall, I should instead consider moving `UP` from `(9, 12)` to `(8, 12)` (which is a blank space). By doing so, I will have more opportunities to explore other movements in subsequent turns.\n\n### Executing Action:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis move enables me to strategically reposition the avatar and potentially access new elements in future moves, thereby aligning with my goal of progression and interaction with required game mechanics."

There are also opportunities to move right or up, but those directions are blocked by walls.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince the avatar is currently positioned adjacent to an empty space to the left and might need access to the key and boiling water, moving left seems to be the most strategic option. It allows the avatar to explore more space while keeping potential pathways open for further actions.\n\nI will proceed with the left action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should help the avatar explore more of the map while keeping options available for the next moves, aligning with the strategy of managing the path efficiently."

Therefore, opening up movement options by going left seems like a prudent first step.\n\nI will take the LEFT action, so:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move opens up more room for exploration, and I can plan my next move based on new surroundings."
