Collect ingredients necessary for cooking, specifically focusing on gathering boiling water (to make pasta) or any ingredients nearby since there is access to (row=9, col=1) which is empty, potentially preparing space for further movements.\n2. No explicit obstacles block the left movement currently, while downward might lead to moving into more ingredient spaces.\n\nGiven that the avatar hasn't moved recently and will simply rotate if a directional command is issued, I will choose to move **down** to (row=10, col=3) to check further below since there may be more opportunities to access resources or ingredients.\n\n```Action:3``` \n\nThe expectation with this action is that it will position the avatar strategically for upcoming moves or to find ingredients that can lead to the successful completion of a dish."
