Given that the `boilingwater` is directly to the left of your current position, I will choose to move left.\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\nThis action will allow your avatar to position itself next to the boiling water, which might be useful for upcoming ingredient combinations. My expectation is that this aligns with the overall strategy of optimizing resource use and preparing for effective combinations."
