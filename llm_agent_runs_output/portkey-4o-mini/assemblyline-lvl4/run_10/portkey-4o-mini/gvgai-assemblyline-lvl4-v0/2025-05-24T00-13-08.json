The crucial information is the position of the avatar (`a`), which is located at `(12, 12)` on the grid.\n\n### Current Map Observations\n- The avatar is situated on an empty floor (represented by `.`).\n- Surrounding the avatar is a wall (`w`) to the left, right, and below, but directly above the avatar, there is another sprite `*`.\n- The relevant items to transform (the `potatoes` shown as `e`) are present along rows 1, 2, 3, and so on, but particularly they can be collected from multiple rows above and need to be transformed into the `potatofull`.\n- There are also assembly sprites located down at row 3, e.g., `$` at positions (3,10), which might be important for the required transformation acknowledging that collecting assemblies will contribute to scoring.\n\n### Possible Actions Based on Game Strategy\n1. **Plan Your Moves**: The avatar is currently blocked on sides due to walls and needs to collect potatoes (`e`) and possibly interact with the assemblies.\n2. **Utilize Levers**: If accessible, these can change the game\u2019s environment, but there seems to be no lever directly adjacent to the avatar.\n3. **Manage Transformations**: As mentioned earlier, transformations are essential; we should first focus on collecting potatoes.\n\nGiven that the immediate action can be a movement up to the assembly sprite or potato sprite; the objective remains to collect necessary items effectively.\n\n### Decision\nThe avatar must first move up since it has a `*` sprite directly above it at position (11, 12). Since this will result in a potential rotation without moving straight away, I need a second upward action to actually move into it. \n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n``` Action:5 ``` \n\n### Feedback\nThis action expects to move the avatar upwards to where the `*` sprite is positioned, which may potentially trigger another interaction or lead to a favorable position next turn.

The goal of the game is to collect assemblies, transform potatoes into the final product \"potatofull\", and deliver it at the goal sprite ('g').\n\nBased on the game layout, there are several important aspects to consider:\n- There are potatoes located at (1,21), (2,21), (3,21), (4,21), (5,21), (6,21), (7,21), (8,21), (9,21), (10,21), and (11,21).\n- The goal sprite is positioned at (3,16).\n- There is a vortex ('v') at (2,3), which can be used for movement.\n\nTo proceed with the game, we need to make sure to collect potatoes and begin the transformation process. However, the avatar is currently at (12,2), with no immediate potatoes in the adjacent positions. \n\nConsidering these observations, the next action should focus on moving toward the potatoes. I will move right (into free space) to ensure my avatar remains actively progressing in the game.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is intended to move the avatar one step to the right, which should help in repositioning towards the rest of the game objectives."
