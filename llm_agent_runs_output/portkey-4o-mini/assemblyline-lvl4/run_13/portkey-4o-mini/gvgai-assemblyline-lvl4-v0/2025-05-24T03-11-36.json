The current position of the avatar is at row 10, column 6, which is marked as 'a', and we are potentially looking to transform the 'potato' located in various positions nearby.\n\n### Action Evaluation:\n1. The avatar is currently positioned at `(10, 6)`.\n2. The nearest 'potato' is at `(1, 21)`, `(2, 21)`, `(3, 21)`, `(4, 21)`, `(5, 21)`, `(6, 21)`, `(7, 21)`, `(8, 21)`, and `(9, 21)`.\n3. There are transformation points represented by `@`, `#`, and `*` nearby which will be essential for achieving the goals to transform 'potato' into 'potatoeyes', 'potatoeyesnose', and finally 'potatofull'.\n\n### Movement Strategy:\nTo start the transformation process, moving left to either `(10, 5)` or continuing up/down to reach a transformation point would be essential. Given that the only significant action nearby seems to be the potential to leverage the `@` (assembly points) in line with potential lasers and the surrounding layout, moving will provide more options.\n\nSince the current strategy necessitates either making an effective step toward an assembly or directly towards a potato, let\u2019s consider moving left since `(10, 5)` does not raise immediate hazards.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis will move the avatar left to `(10, 5)`. I expect that this aligns well with the overall strategy of exploring the layout further and eventually targeting the nearby transformation points and potatoes."

The goal is located at (3, 16), which may require moving towards this direction and interacting with items along the way.\n\n### Current Objective\nThe most immediate goal would be to retrieve the potato to start the transformation process. The potato is located at (1, 21), but the path is blocked by walls and various assemblies.\n\n### Action Strategy \nGiven that the avatar's initial action was last assessed without a directional change and given the layout of the nearest potato, it would be prudent to first establish movement towards the nearest open path rather than initiating any potential lever use right now.\n\n**Next Action**: Move `DOWN` towards (12, 2).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\n### Feedback/Expectation\nThis action will move the avatar down into an area that may provide further options, facilitating potential horizontal movements towards the potato or interaction with the assembly systems, which is critical for progressing towards transformation and ultimately achieving the goal."
