The immediate surroundings consist of walls ('w'), empty spaces ('.'), potato sprites ('e'), a vortex ('v'), and various assembly and lever elements.\n\nSince my previous action did not change my position, I must consider different strategies.\n\n1. **Understanding Potential Goals**: The target seems to be transforming potatoes into higher forms, as well as reaching the goal ('g') located at (row=3, col=16).\n2. **Lever Interactions**: The lever on the left (located at row=11, col=5) may grant access to transforming the potatoes or clearing the path.\n\nTo make progress, let's try to interact with the lever directly to see if it triggers any helpful mechanics or transformation. Thus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis interaction should allow me to understand the results of manipulating the lever and potentially set off a series of beneficial interactions to progress towards my goal."

The avatar is represented by 'a', and we need to locate the avatar position and determine possibilities for action.\n\nGiven this map:\n- The avatar 'a' is situated at (row=11, col=5).\n- The nearby entities to consider are:\n  - At (11, 4), there is an assembly type '@'.\n  - At (11, 6), there is a blank space (floor).\n  \nThe goal is to guide the avatar through a series of actions to win the game by reaching the transformation states of the 'potato' sprites and ultimately reaching the goal.\n\nSince the avatar is at position (11, 5), I will consider using the nearby assembly at (11, 4). To do that, I might need to move LEFT first.\n\n### Action selected\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\nThis action might allow the avatar to interact with the assembly or move closer to a more strategic position to proceed. The expectation is that moving left will facilitate interaction with the assembly type or explore further available actions effectively."
