After using the lever, we can reassess our position and plan our next moves based on the new state of the game.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nTo start with, I will use the lever in hopes that it effects a change that allows more movements or interactions which may be crucial in maximizing our score and transforming the potato.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing the lever seems critical as it may open up new paths or trigger necessary mechanics to proceed with the transformations.

The objective is to collect and transform the potato ('e') into its final form ('potatofull') and deliver it to the goal ('g').\n\nThe strategy to proceed involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Analyze the Avatar's Position**: The avatar is currently positioned at (12, 1), surrounded by walls except on the left where it can move to (12, 0) or the right where it has the option to go to (12, 2) which is still a wall. Therefore, the only initial move options available are either to interact with surrounding items or to move left.\n\n2. **Identify the Next Action**: There is a potato ('e') located at (11, 21), but the avatar needs to find a viable path to reach and transform it. The current path does not directly lead to the potato given the walls in the game layout.\n\n3. **Consider the Interactions**: The avatar can interact with items, such as the lever ('h') located at (11, 1) to potentially open new paths or activate elements needed to progress in the game.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position does not change significantly after the last action, it is essential to utilize the first action effectively to enhance the possible moves.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best immediate action for the avatar is to **use the lever** at (11, 1) to explore the outcomes of that interaction.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nUsing the lever seems logical as it may lead to the opening of new paths or manipulate the environment in a beneficial way. My expectation is that this will allow me to create a more advantageous path towards the potato and ultimately towards the goal."
