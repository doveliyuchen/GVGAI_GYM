Thus, the most pragmatic action involves interacting with the nearest potato to maximize progress.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n1. The avatar is close to multiple 'e' (potato) sprites located at:\n   - (1, 21)\n   - (2, 21)\n   - (3, 21)\n   - (4, 21)\n   - (5, 21)\n   - (6, 21)\n   - (7, 21)\n   - (8, 21)\n   - (9, 21)\n\n2. The nearby assembly points ('#' and '@') can also be valuable for transforming the potato into a higher point state, alongside accessing the goal ('g') directly below the avatar at (3, 16).\n\n### Possible Actions:\nTo optimize movement, I need to check the surroundings first to ensure the avatar can move downwards toward an 'e' without hitting walls.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action involves moving downward, which is paramount as it would bring the avatar nearer to a potato (e) while also keeping in line with the ultimate aim of reaching the goal ('g'). \n\n### Feedback on Action:\nMoving down will allow the avatar to interact with potatoes in the next row and contribute toward necessary transformations and ultimately reaching the victory goal. I expect to see an 'e' at (11, 19) after this action, and hopefully be able to move towards transformation thereafter."

This requires:\n1. **Collecting Potatoes**: The nearest potatoes are at `(row=10, col=21)` and `(row=9, col=21)`.\n2. **Reaching Assembly Points**: The assembly points are to the left of my current position, but I need to collect potatoes first.\n3. **Time Management**: Keep an eye on the timer to ensure I act efficiently.\n\n### Movement Analysis\nSince I need to collect a potato, moving towards the nearest potato in the column is critical. The nearest potato is directly above me at `(row=10, col=21)`.\n\n1. My current position is at `(11,19)`, and I should move to `(10,19)` and then left to `(10,21)` to interact with the potato.\n2. The left action can cause a rotation, which would need to be followed up by another left action if I do not move immediately.\n\n### Selected Action\nI will perform the action to move **LEFT** (to position `(11,18)`), then I will check if I am still able to successfully collect the potato.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should bring me closer to the potato, and I expect to be able to collect it in subsequent moves to execute my strategy effectively."

The relevant context includes:\n- There are potatoes 'e' nearby in rows 1 to 10 (columns 21, 21, 21, etc.).\n- There are assembly points '@' at (11, 10) and two above at (10, 10) and (10, 11).\n- The goal 'g' is located at (3, 16).\n- There are vortex 'v' sprites that could potentially be used for navigation.\n\n### Analyzing Position and Potential Moves\nCurrently, the avatar is directly next to two assembly points. This proximity to assembly points allows for potential transformation of potatoes if they are carried to these spots. The closest potato appears to be at (3, 21), which I could interact with, and the goal g suggests a strategic need to transform items quickly to achieve scoring and win conditions.\n\nGiven that movement is necessary from this position (11, 12), I can look at the available actions:\n- **Up (11,11)** - This is a direct interaction with the assembly point '@' but does not lead to scoring.\n- **Down (11,13)** - This position is empty, and moving here may open up other interactions.\n- **Left (12,12)** - This would rotate the avatar but does not seem to lead to progress.\n- **Right (11,14)** - This leads directly into walls.\n  \nTo maximize efficiency, I should first consider transforming a nearby potato or aligning my avatar closer to the goal while checking for any other potential movements that the vortex might provide.\n\n### Proposed Action\nConsidering the above analysis:\n1. I will attempt to move **downwards (to 12, 12)** to check if this opens pathways to any potato or assembly item, or emits a vortex interaction.\n\n### Action Selection\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis downward movement is anticipated to either lead closer to a potato pick-up or maintain optimal positioning near an assembly point."

Since the adjacent assembly points `@` allow for interaction (presumably transformation), moving towards one of them and preparing for interaction should be the goal.\n\n### Proposed Action\nSince the avatar is currently oriented towards and adjacent to an assembly point on the right (row=11, col=12), the logical action would be to use the `ACTION_USE` command to start the transformation process.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should activate the assembly mechanism to potentially transform a potato into further states and contribute toward the win condition.

In the current map, the avatar is not directly identified, but I note the presence of entities like potatoes (marked as 'e') and assembly points (marked as '@', '#', and '$') along with the goal 'g'.\n  \n- The map is predominantly surrounded by walls 'w', leaving limited paths to navigate. However, there are several potatoes and assembly points scattered throughout various rows, which are essential for progressing towards the goal.\n\n### Suggested Action\nTo begin, the first strategic step should be to locate the closest potato and then consider subsequent actions based on interactions with the assembly points or other relevant entities in the environment. \n\nSince the avatar must prioritize collecting a potato, I would suggest moving towards the position of the nearest potato.\n\nAssuming I am positioned at a location from which I can move toward the potato at row 1, col 21, the action should be **ACTION_DOWN (action number 4)** if needed to reach the bottom row where more potatoes are present.\n\nIf I can't move down (due to walls or other blocks), I would choose an alternative movement to ensure my avatar takes an action that progresses toward collecting the required items.\n\n### Final Decision\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aims to navigate towards essential items and aligns with the strategy to prioritize collecting potatoes for assembly and ultimately reaching the goal."
