Since looking down or moving towards the assemblies seems viable, I can initiate movement by moving either left or right to check for available interactions.\n\nConsidering the surroundings and ensuring that the position changes to either move closer to the potato or the assemblies, the first action will be:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right (to (11, 7)).
