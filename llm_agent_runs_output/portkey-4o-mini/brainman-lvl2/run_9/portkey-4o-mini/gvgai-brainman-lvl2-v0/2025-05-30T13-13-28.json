Additionally, there's a boulder located at (4, 3), which I might utilize later to clear obstacles or interact with other sprites if necessary.\n\nSince the current strategy emphasizes avoidance of detrimental gems (located at several places in the lower rows), my immediate focus is on safety and potential point collection.\n\nNext steps:\n- I should try to collect the key before heading to the exit because it may require unlocking a door, or it may allow for better scoring options. However, there are some gems nearby (at (1, 8) and (2, 9)) which I must avoid.\n\nTo safely navigate towards the key without going closer to the gems:\n- I will move **LEFT**, allowing me to check the path.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will help in determining if the path is safe while getting closer to the key without encountering hazards.
