The level above (row 4) is important because it leads to the exit at (4, 14). There is a door above at (5, 13) that can be opened if keys are collected.\n\n### Plan of Action\nThe immediate goal should be to access the adjacent floor to collect keys. The avatar can move closer towards the location of the nearest key which is located at (2, 2) or (2, 6).\n\nGiven my current state at (5, 7), my best option is to move **Up** (to (4, 7)) to navigate towards the upper row where both keys are located, which might also open additional paths towards collecting more resources or reaching the exit.\n\nLet's proceed with this first action.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving upwards positions the avatar to possibly interact with more sprites and better manage the next steps towards collecting keys and reaching the exit while avoiding obstacles."
