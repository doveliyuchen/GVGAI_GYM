The nearest & is located at (1, 8) and (2, 9), which means movement towards them should be avoided.\n\n3. **Doors**: There are doors (represented by '$') to the left at (5, 13) and at (7, 10), which will need keys to unlock or bypass.\n\n4. **Exit**: The exit (denoted by '%') is at position (4, 14), which will require strategic planning to reach, potentially while avoiding hazards.\n\nSince the avatar is currently at (7, 5) and there are no immediate available actions that would reposition the avatar, we should make a move. I will move the avatar down to explore and collect items, as the upward and leftward movements are limited due to walls and hazards.\n\n**Action**: I choose to move **down** to (8, 5).\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis should allow us to either continue checking for collectibles or identify a path towards the exit while avoiding hazards effectively."

Collecting keys and gems is crucial to score points and unlock doors.\n2. The avatar must navigate and avoid harmful gems (green `&` and red `b`).\n3. The avatar must reach exits without being defeated.\n\nGiven the avatar's position, two possible actions are:\n- Move left to (row=7, col=6) which is an empty space (not beneficial).\n- Move right to (row=7, col=8) which is another empty space (not directly beneficial).\n- Moving down to (row=8, col=7) would potentially allow interaction with a door that could lead to further progress.\n\nChoosing the most strategic action to advance:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar downwards, aiming for the door at (row=8, col=7). The expectation is to discover more opportunities for collecting keys or gems or moving towards an exit. This aligns with the strategy of utilizing items and unlocking doors to progress in the game."

Given the focus on avoiding hazards like the green gem, I should not move in that direction.\n2. The doors at (row=7, col=0) and (row=7, col=10) can be relevant for my movements; however, I currently don\u2019t have keys to open the door at (row=7, col=10).\n3. Since the avatar is to the left of the door at (row=7, col=0), it makes logical sense to move left first.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed and to further analyze the situation, I will move to the left to position myself better and find a way to avoid hazards.\n\nThus, I will execute the action:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is in line with the strategy of exploring the area and managing to avoid immediate hazards while assessing the next steps from this safer position."

Looking at the map, there are several interactions and items close by:\n\n- To the west (left) are empty spaces where the avatar can move.\n- To the east (right), there are doors '$' at (row 7, col 10) and (row 8, col 6).\n- To the north (up), at (row 6, col 5) is an empty space.\n- To the south (down), at (row 8, col 5) is also an empty space.\n\nThe objective is to navigate and collect as many keys and gems as possible while avoiding hazards. In this case, your position does not need immediate movement since there are walls to the immediate left (col 4) and right (col 6), so no meaningful action can be taken moving left or right.\n\nLet's choose a downward movement to explore further since there are empty spaces; the goal is to reach new areas on the map and possibly find more gems or keys.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows for movement downwards, opening opportunities to explore row 8. I expect to find more gems or keys, enhancing our strategy for collecting items and reaching exits swiftly."

Additionally, the objective is to explore and collect items and avoid hazards while making progress towards exits.\n\nFollowing the suggested strategy of exploring and collecting keys and gems while being mindful of potential hazards, I can either move up or down to progress.\n\nSince no immediate action leads to a collection of gems or items, I will choose to move **up**. This action will allow me to potentially see further into the next row and identify any more collectable items or paths towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move up allows me to explore more of the space above and could open up new opportunities for collecting items or moving towards the exit."
