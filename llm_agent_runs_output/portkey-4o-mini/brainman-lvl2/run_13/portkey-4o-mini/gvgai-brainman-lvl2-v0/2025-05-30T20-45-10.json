While generally avoiding hazardous interactions, collecting the key is beneficial as it's a resource that can be used later.\n\n### Selected Action\n``` Action: 1 ```\nCollecting the key to enhance resource management fits well with the strategy of prioritizing item collection and is a meaningful step towards reaching the exit effectively."
