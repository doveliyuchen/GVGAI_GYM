There are also keys (`*`) at (2, 2) and (2, 6) that can be collected to unlock doors.\n3. The exit (`%`) is located at (4, 14).\n\nNow let's analyze the potential actions:\n\n- **Up (5, 6)**: Moves to a floor space (empty).\n- **Down (7, 6)**: Moves to a floor space (empty).\n- **Left (6, 5)**: Moves to a floor space (empty).\n- **Right (6, 7)**: Moves to a floor space (empty).\n\nAll these moves avoid harmful gems, but we also need to consider key collection. \n\nSince we are not currently moving towards a door or approaching the exit with the present actions, I would suggest moving in a strategic direction to either gather a key or to advance towards the exit while also avoiding hazardous gems.\n\nChoosing to move **down (7, 6)** would allow for potential movement towards the exit route as it keeps options open for the next moves while avoiding immediate hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action provides a clear path and potentially sets you up for future turns, aligning with the strategy of preparing for the exit."

(open space)\n\nThe path is clear up, down, left, and right. I can rotate the avatar direction and move from here. Although moving down to (8, 6) would take me directly to a door, I first need to collect keys to open it. The nearest visible key is located at (2, 2) nearby.\n\nThough the immediate goal is to progress toward the door, it is essential to gather keys beforehand. Thus, the most strategic move right now is to be aware of the entire layout while collecting more items as I navigate.\n\nI will move to explore the nearby open space (8, 6) first so I can simultaneously assess opportunities to collect necessary keys or avoid harmful items in subsequent moves.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to advance towards the door and verify my surrounding conditions further.

I need to analyze further before deciding on the next steps. \n\nAction: `0`\nI've chosen not to move to avoid any potential harm or inefficient action that could worsen my situation.
