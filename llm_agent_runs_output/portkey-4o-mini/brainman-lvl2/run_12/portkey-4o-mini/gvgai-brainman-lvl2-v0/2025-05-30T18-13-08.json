The exit is located at (4, 14), which is accessible but requires movement towards the exit while navigating around obstacles.\n\nUpon reviewing the immediate state, the avatar is currently surrounded by an empty space to move around. Given that doors require keys to open and the presence of boulders can serve to move or redirect the avatar, the primary goal here would be to collect any essential items that will assist in reaching the exit. In this case, the collectible items nearby include a key located at (1, 7), which is crucial for unlocking doors later.\n\nGiven the above observations, moving left, down, up, or continuing right will not result in immediate changes without proper planning. Since the avatar's last action did not move it closer to a key or towards the exit:\n\nI will choose the action that moves towards collecting a key, opening up more movement options and opportunities to ultimately reach the exit.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action will move the avatar left to (5, 5). The expectation is to explore more opportunities and avoid getting stuck or cornered, all while respecting the game's strategy."
