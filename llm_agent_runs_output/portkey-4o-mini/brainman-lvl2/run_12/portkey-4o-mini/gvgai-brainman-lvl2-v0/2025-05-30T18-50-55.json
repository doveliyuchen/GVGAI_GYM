To the left (7,8) is a `door ($)`.\n2. To the right (7,10) is another `door ($)`.\n3. Up (6,9) is a `green (b)`.\n4. Below (8,9) is a `&`, which means it might also be utilized for potential moves or as a key.\n\n### Plan:\nGiven the objective is to reach the exit, it is crucial to examine the closest route. \n\n### Action Analysis:\n- **Left (7,8)**: Attempting to move left towards the door does not directly lead us to the exit.\n- **Right (7,10)**: Moving right also leads to another door.\n- **Up (6,9)**: This moves towards a green object, which we want to avoid.\n- **Down (8,9)**: Possible path but it moves into floor `&` which can have implications depending on further movement. \n\nSince our avatar position does not change, it\u2019s best to try moving left towards the door to see if we can open or progress.\n\n### Action:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis left move might help us assess our path better, while avoiding direct obstacles.

Moving up (to 6,8) or down (to 8,8) offers potential routes towards progressing toward the exit as both directions are clear, whereas left and right also lead to empty spaces.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nGiven the options and the goal to keep exploring towards the exit, the upward direction offers a path that leads back toward the upper rows closer to the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up and allows exploration of what's available in the next row while maintaining the goal of avoiding hazards.
