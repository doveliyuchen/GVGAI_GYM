Thus, moving towards areas of the map that potentially contain keys or gems is essential.\n\n3. **Avoiding Walls and Hazards**: The avatar should carefully navigate through the maze while avoiding walls. Walls may hinder progress but can also serve as a barrier against hazardous interactions.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven the above considerations, moving **DOWN** to row (7, 6) offers an opportunity to explore more and potentially access other pathways or items without immediate adverse consequences.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action of moving down is intended to explore further and opens up additional options, aligning well with the strategy of familiarizing with the map."
