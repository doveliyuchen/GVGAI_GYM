The avatar can move to interact with the surrounding boxes.\n2. Moving up will change the state of the blue box to a blue block, which will contribute to the score.\n3. Moving down will simply land on a green box, which isn't immediately favorable since it doesn't help eliminate boxes.\n4. Moving left (6, 1) or right (6, 3) also provides additional interactions with empty floor or the red box.\n\n### Current Strategy\nGiven the immediate options, the best move for the avatar is to go **up** to (5, 2) which allows the avatar to interact with the blue box and eliminate it, contributing to the overall goal.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action will transform the blue box into a blue block, aligning with the strategy of eliminating boxes efficiently.
