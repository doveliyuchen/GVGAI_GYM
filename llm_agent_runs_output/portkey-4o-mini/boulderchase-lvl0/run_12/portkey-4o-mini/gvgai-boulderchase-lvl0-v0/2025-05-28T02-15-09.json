The exit door is not currently visible, so we should prioritize gathering resources (diamonds) moving toward areas where they may be present.\n\n### Collection Opportunities:\nLooking at the full map and based on the layout:\n- There are diamonds located to the left `(row=3, col=5)` and further down multiple positions down the column leading to `(row=4, col=18)`.\n- This path toward the left seems promising, as it also leads toward rows that feature numerous diamonds.\n\n### Planned Action:\nGiven that our previous action resulted in no movement (as we started at a specific coordinate), we should now make a move to the left, which would move the avatar to `(row=10, col=8)`.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nThis move will bring the avatar one space closer to potentially collecting more diamonds to the left in the following turns, while keeping us safe.\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\n\nThis action is meaningful as it aligns with our strategy to collect resources efficiently while navigating safely through the environment."
