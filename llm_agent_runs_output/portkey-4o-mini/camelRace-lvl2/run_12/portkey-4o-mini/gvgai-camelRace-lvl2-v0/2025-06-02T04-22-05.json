The sprites 'randomCamel' are present at coordinates such as (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3), which move towards the goal. Therefore, it's critical to navigate around them effectively.\n\n### Strategy for Movement:\nGiven that the objective is to quickly reach the goal while avoiding collisions with camels, the ideal movement is to find a clear path toward the closest goal position. The fields immediately next to the goal are critical as they can lead to direct interaction with other sprites and any obstacles.\n\n### Selected Action:\nSince the avatar's exact position isn't provided, but based on the strategy\u2014my focus will be to make it to one of the usable path options toward the goal. The character must ensure not to stand still and act continually to navigate the map effectively.\n\n```Action: 3```\n\nThis action (ACTION_DOWN) is chosen with the expectation that it positions me toward the lower levels where the goal resides, thus hopefully clear from obstructing camels while working toward the goal. If the avatar does not move down successfully or remains in the same position, I will need to reassess the environment and provide a different action next."

The immediate columns (33 to 45) have no walls or sprites that would prevent the avatar from moving.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **Check for Obstacles:**\n   - I need to ascertain that there's nothing in the way by considering if I can move to the right. \n\n2. **Execute Movement:**\n   - Since the avatar was stationary last turn, the most logical move is to try to proceed right.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\nAfter assessing the area, moving right towards the goal is my best option, helping me pursue victory swiftly.

Given the current barriers, reaching that directly is not possible without careful maneuvering.\n3. **Immediate Action:** The next logical move is to first avoid the `fastR` by moving up from `(1, 35)` to `(0, 35)` or down if there's space and strategic advantage.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince the current position does not allow for movement to the goal due to fastR obstacles, moving **up** is a clear logical choice to avoid collision and prepare for a better path towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should increase my chances to maneuver around the sprites effectively while avoiding immediate collisions."
