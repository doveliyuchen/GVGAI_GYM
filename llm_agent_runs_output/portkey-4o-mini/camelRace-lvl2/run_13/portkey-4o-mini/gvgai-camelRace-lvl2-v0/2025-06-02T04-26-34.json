The expectation is to navigate the avatar closer to the goal while avoiding getting blocked by camels or walls. Also, moving towards the right now will enable a more strategic planning for subsequent moves."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I need to assess my position and determine the best action to take towards reaching the green door (goal).\n\n### Current Player Position\n- Based on the provided map, my current player (`a`) position is not defined in the grid explicitly. Therefore, I will assume I am in a place that allows maneuverability and not too close to camels or walls.\n\n### External Conditions\n- The goal is located at (1, 46).\n- Fast and medium camels are noted around my potential starting area, and I need to avoid getting caught by them.\n\n### Strategy\nTo reach the goal while avoiding camels, I will:\n1. **Determine My Direction**: Identify a pathway that leads me towards the exit, being mindful of any nearby camels that could block or hinder my movement.\n2. **Plan Movement**: Given that I have not provided my current coordinates and cannot change the position, I should rotate towards the possible direction that leads me to the goal without encountering obstacles.\n\nIn this context, my actions would involve rotating towards the goal and, if not moving after the rotation, applying the same action again. \n\nIf I assume that my last action was an upward movement from (for instance) (7, 45) to (7, 46) right above the goal node where my goal is located:\n\n### Decision\n- Knowing that the goal is below, I will rotate and move down towards the goal directly:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis downward action is expected to lead towards the goal without hindrance, considering that previous wall interactions may have capped available movements. I expect this action to move me directly towards the winning condition."
