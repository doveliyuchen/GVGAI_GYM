Therefore, the best approach without deeper insight into current positioning would typically be to move towards the goal if possible:\n\n**I will attempt to move right towards the goal.**\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis move is strategic in that it attempts to close the gap toward the goal while potentially outmaneuvering the camels. If I didn't move left in previous turns, I should be able to make a worthwhile advance!"

If the player makes a movement, they might get blocked or even lose points if a camel reaches the goal first.\n- The player goal is to reach (1, 46) without letting a camel reach there first.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n1. The camels are close and could potentially block the avatar's path to the goal. If I remain at my current position (1, 1), I'm at immediate risk from the camels.\n2. I should consider moving away from the camels first, to create distance and clear a path.\n\n### Next Action\nGiven the proximity of the camels, moving right (to (1, 2)) might not be advantageous. Moving left is also not possible. Thus, I will attempt to move by going up to (0, 1).\n\nConsidering this analysis, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should reposition me to (0, 1), creating distance from the camels and allowing me to further evaluate my options towards reaching the goal."
