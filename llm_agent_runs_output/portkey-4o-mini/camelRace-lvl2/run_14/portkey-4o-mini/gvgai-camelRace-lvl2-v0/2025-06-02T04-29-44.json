The avatar's ability to block or outmaneuver the camels is crucial.\n\n### Analysis of the Current State:\n- The avatar is not explicitly mentioned in the current state description. Assuming it's somewhere in the map, the focus is on strategizing based on the position of the camels.\n- There are camels towards the left side of the map (particularly at (1, 4) and (1, 5) with multiple moving camels also present in later rows).\n- The goal at (1, 46) is towards the right side of the map, which is a considerable distance away from the camels.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- Given that the camels are currently positioned more towards the left side and there are several blocks preventing direct access to the right, it's vital to ensure movement towards the goal while avoiding direct paths to faster or unpredictable camels.\n- Observing and managing interaction with the environment (like walls) effectively can guide movement choices.\n\n### Decision:\nSince the avatar's position is crucial and we aim to navigate closer to the goal without losing valuable movement opportunities, I will move the avatar to the right towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to bring the avatar closer to the goal while remaining vigilant of the camel movements."
