The immediate columns from the avatar's position towards the direction of the goal are mostly free of walls, but there are camels in columns 1 and 2 that need to be avoided.\n\n### Deciding Action\nThe avatar must first check if it can move directly right (since that is the direction towards the goal). \n\n- The avatar is at (1,21), and the cells to the right are as follows:\n  - (1,22) = '@' (camel) \n  - (1,23) = '.' (empty) \n  - (1,24) = '.' (empty) \n  - ...\n  - (1,46) = '#' (goal)\n\nSince moving right into (1,22) leads to a camel, this move would not be possible.\n\nNext, the avatar can try to move down first to navigate around the immediate threat of the camel. Below (1,21), at (2,21) is also a camel (%), so moving down is still not viable. \n\nAdditionally, moving left does not help either because column 20 also has a free cell, but it would not lead closer to the goal. Given that upward (0,21) is a wall (f), the only viable option appears to be to rotate.\n\nHowever, there's a significant amount of empty space toward the right along column 23 onward, but an initial obstructive camel at (1,22).\n\nThus, performing `ACTION_NIL` would not yield any immediate movement. \n\nHence, I will perform an action to navigate around these obstacles wisely. The most clever initial move here would be to explore another viable direction and establish strategic movement without actually clashing with camels.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action represents moving up while trying to reposition the avatar in hopes of finding a clearer path towards the goal later on.
