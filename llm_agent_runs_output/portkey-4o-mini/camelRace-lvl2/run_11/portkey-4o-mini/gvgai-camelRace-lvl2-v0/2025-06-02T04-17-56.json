    "content": "Given the current state of the game, our first step is to identify the avatar's position (represented by 'a') and the positions of the goal ('#') and enemy NPCs ('@', '%', etc.).\n\nHowever, I need to define the avatar's position. Still, the map provided does not include the avatar's position explicitly. I will assume the avatar is at (1, 41) based on the positions of NPCs (representation '@') and the goal '#' at (1, 46).\n\nWith the goal in mind, the avatar must reach (1, 46) before any enemy NPC can do so. Currently, the avatar is five columns away from the goal, and to the left, there are two enemy NPCs represented by '@'. The enemy NPCs are at (1, 41) and (1, 42). \n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Current Position**: Assumed avatar at (1, 41). The goal is at (1, 46).\n2. **NPCs**: Two NPCs at columns (1, 41) and (1, 42).\n3. **Wall Obstacles**: The surrounding walls generally create barriers that restrict movement, but at this point, movement to the right toward the goal is not blocked.\n4. **Action Options**: The possible actions are to move left, right, down, up, or to do nothing (nil).\n\n### Next Move Consideration:\nThe optimal move is to move right (to (1, 42)) to close in towards the goal. This also allows the player to potentially reach the goal first since the enemy NPCs need to be at least 4 moves away, as they also must avoid the walls.\n\nI will take the action to move right:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis move is expected to allow me to close the distance to the goal while potentially setting up strategy for subsequent turns based on the positioning of the enemy NPCs."

Since the enemy camels can also move, strategic navigation while keeping an eye on their positions is crucial.\n\n### Current Status and Strategy:\nGiven this information, the immediate strategy involves moving towards the goal while avoiding any potential collisions with the enemy camels.\n\n#### My Action:\nThe most strategic movement from the current situation is to navigate towards the right to approach the goal.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should enable the player to make significant progress towards the goal position at (1, 46)."

The goal is represented by the green door ('#') located at several spots in the map (rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). \n\n**Enemy NPCs:**\nThere are enemy camels represented by '%' in various positions:\n- At (1, 1)\n- At (2, 1)\n- At (3, 1)\n- At (5, 3)\n- At (5, 4)\n- At (6, 3)\n- At (6, 4)\n\nGiven the layout, there are multiple possible paths toward the green door, but we need to prioritize avoiding the enemy camels to prevent them from reaching the goal first.\n\n**Available Actions (with potential outcomes):**\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Likely not effective as it would push the avatar against a wall at the current row.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Moving right toward (1, 44) where two fast camels (@) and the goal (#) are located makes sense as there are less wall obstructions in that direction.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: This won't help navigate closer to the goal since walls are present downward.\n- **ACTION_UP (4)**: Moving up won't be beneficial either as it might cause wall collisions or routing further from the goal.\n\n**Analysis of Last Move:**\nAssuming the avatar hasn't moved from the previous turn, the logical next step is to move right to avoid collision with walls and progress efficiently toward the goal. \n\nThus, the action to perform is:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis move aligns with the strategy to reach the goal swiftly while navigating around enemy camels and avoiding obstacles."
