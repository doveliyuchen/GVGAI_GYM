There are several important factors to consider for the next move:\n\n1. **Chickens**: There are slow chickens ('@') at (1, 9) and (1, 10). They can potentially attack you, so maintaining distance from them is essential.\n  \n2. **Explosive Eggs**: The map features explosive eggs ('*') at (3, 8), (3, 9), (9, 6), and (9, 7) that you can collect. Gathering these resources is crucial for managing your ability to eliminate chickens.\n\n3. **Walled Areas**: The walls ('$') form barriers and could be used to navigate around chickens safely while collecting eggs.\n\nGiven that your avatar is currently at (10, 5) and has not moved (thus indicating the need to act), a strategic move would be to head towards one of the explosive eggs while avoiding any encounters with chickens. The most accessible explosive eggs are at (3, 8) and (3, 9), but that area also contains a potential risk of encountering chickens.\n\nHere's a recommended action to ensure resource management while keeping distance from the chickens:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move you left to (10, 4) while providing enough space from the chickens to strategize your next move. I expect this aligns with the strategy of avoiding chickens while focusing on resource gathering."

This aligns with the strategy of resource hunting and maintaining distance from potential threats."

The objective is to defeat all chickens while managing resources effectively, as previously discussed.\n\n**Key Observations**:\n1. There are explosive eggs ('*') within reach at (row 10, col 8) and (row 9, col 8).\n2. The nearest chickens are not currently visible in the immediate vicinity of the avatar, which suggests a safer opportunity to collect resources.\n3. The area to the right contains two explosive eggs and is relatively unobstructed.\n\nGiven these observations, the next action should focus on moving toward the explosive eggs to collect resources, thereby improving the ability to defeat chickens later.\n\n**Action Decision**:\nI'll move to the right to the location of the explosive eggs at (row 10, col 3).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aims to position the avatar closer to the valuable resources needed for defeating chickens. I expect to successfully collect eggs or at least prepare for future movements in the maze."
