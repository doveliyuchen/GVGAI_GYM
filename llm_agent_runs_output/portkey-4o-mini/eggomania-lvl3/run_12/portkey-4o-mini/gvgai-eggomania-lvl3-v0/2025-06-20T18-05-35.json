Looking around in the vicinity of (10,1), there's no visible egg present nearby. This means we may need to explore further to find a path toward resources while avoiding the walls and chickens.\n3. **Motion**: Since the avatar has been stationary, we should first try moving in one of the possible directions.\n\n### Next Move:\nI will choose to move **RIGHT** to (10,2), which is an open space, and explore further for resources or paths.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action should allow the avatar to progress towards potential resource areas while avoiding immediate threats.

They are a significant threat and should be avoided since the (10, 2) position currently lacks explosive eggs.\n- **Resource Collection**: The immediate need is to collect more resources. The closest eggs are located in row 4 (two eggs) and row 5 (two more eggs).\n\n### Strategic Movement:\nTo maximize resource collection while avoiding immediate threats, I will move down towards row 4 where the eggs are located.\n\nSince there are walls blocking left or right movements from the current position in row 10, the possible action is to move down.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action should lead me to assess whether there are options to collect the eggs when I reach the next row and to keep a safe distance from the chickens above.
