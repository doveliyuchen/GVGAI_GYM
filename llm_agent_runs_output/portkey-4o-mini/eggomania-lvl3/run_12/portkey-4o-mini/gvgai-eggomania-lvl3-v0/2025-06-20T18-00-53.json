Currently, I need to evaluate my actions based on the positioning of the chickens and the surrounding environment.\n\n### Observations:\n- **Chicken Threat**: The chickens are quite far, but they can move towards me, and I need to utilize my explosive eggs wisely (which I currently don't have as none are indicated in the current state).\n- **Walls**: There are walls surrounding my current position, and nearby are paths where I could potentially find eggs.\n- **No Immediate Resources**: I must move toward the areas where eggs are likely to be found.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move Toward Potential Egg Locations**: To gather explosive eggs, I need to move towards accessible locations, aiming for rows that are shown to have multiple items, particularly where there are eggs.\n2. **Avoid Threats**: I must keep a safe distance from the chickens while I search for resources.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe most strategic move right now is to begin progressing horizontally to collect resources and avoid potential encounters with the chickens. The nearby egg locations are in the 8th and 7th rows.\n\nI will opt to move **LEFT** to explore towards potential egg locations.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to reposition towards areas where eggs may be found, following the strategy of resource management and avoiding chicken threats."

They are far enough to not pose an immediate danger, but they can become a threat in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n1. To ensure survival, I need to gather explosive eggs while also ensuring I am not allowing the chickens to close in on me.\n2. I should prioritize collecting the eggs positioned to the right (10, 8) and (10, 9).\n\n### Choice of Action:\nTo start, I will attempt to collect an egg which is right next to the avatar at (10, 8).\n\n``` \nAction: 1\n```\n\nCollecting the explosive egg will allow me to increase my resources and maintain the upper hand against the approaching chickens."
