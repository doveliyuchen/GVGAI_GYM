If there's no movement indicated afterward, a follow-up step will be necessary to ensure I continue toward exploring for potential resources or moving towards areas with fewer threats.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the right movement:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis action is expected to help me further explore the area and potentially find useful resources without immediate threat from the chickens."
