It's currently surrounded by walls on rows 11 and 12 (both marked with '$'), limiting movement options.\n\n2. **Nearby Entities**: \n   - There are explosive eggs ('*') at (8, 9) and (8, 10), (9, 9) and (9, 10), and (10, 8) and (10, 9). Collecting these could provide valuable resources.\n   - Directly adjacent to the avatar, there is empty space at (10, 4) and (10, 2), but vertical movement is blocked by walls.\n\n3. **Enemy Presence**: Chickens ('@') appear at (1, 11) and (1, 12), meaning they are far from the current position of the player. \n\n### Proposed Action:\nWe should first aim to move towards the explosive eggs while ensuring we have a clear path away from potential threats. The current best move is to use the available 'ACTION_RIGHT' to move from (10, 3) to (10, 4), approaching one of the explosive eggs.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis move maintains our safety by not approaching the chickens while still advancing towards valuable resources. I expect this is effective in managing resources and preparing for the next moves."
