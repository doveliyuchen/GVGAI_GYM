(empty)\n   - (8, 31), above (7, 31): 'p' (wall)\n   - (8, 31), below (9, 31): 'p' (wall)\n\nThe only empty position nearby is (8, 32). Therefore, moving to the right is the only immediate step.\n\n### Next Action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nBy moving right, I open up more potential moves to gather passengers or adjust levers in subsequent turns. This aligns with the strategy to explore and manipulate the pathways while avoiding obstacles."

According to the provided map, the avatar is located at (row=8, col=32).\n\n### Current State Analysis\n- Surrounding area:\n  - (row=8, col=31) is a lever (`*`), which can potentially be pulled to change the belts or joints.\n  - (row=8, col=33) is a joint (`b`), specifically a right joint that may also impact movement.\n\n### Strategy\n- The immediate task is to make a move that either pulls the lever or potentially moves towards the right joint.\n- Since the avatar's position does not change (it stays at (8,32)), the first action should either be to pull the lever or to evaluate further movements towards the joint.\n\n### Available Actions\n1. **Action: Pull the Lever (`*`) at (8,31)** - This action may change the functionality of the joints or other mechanics, allowing us to further interact with passengers or avoid hazards effectively.\n2. **Action: Move Towards the Right Joint (`b`) at (8,33)** - Moving might also be beneficial.\n\nGiven the current threats (surrounding walls and death hazards), it makes sense to utilize the lever first for potential strategic advantage.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe best action to take now is to pull the lever, which might help reconfigure future movements of the suitcase or other sprites.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action pulls the lever, hopefully improving positioning and enabling upcoming strategic plays without causing the avatar to remain stagnant or at risk."

The best approach now would be to rotate the avatar to get a better angle or position for the next move.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven that the avatar's position has not changed recently, we will execute a leftward movement to see if that provides a new pathway or rotation towards future actions.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis left movement should help reposition towards collecting passengers or interacting with levers or suitcases in a more advantageous way, in line with securing passengers and avoiding score loss from hazards."

The feedback is that the strategic focus needs to pivot towards leveraging nearby levers for future mobility or the suitcase's mechanics, as the avatar currently cannot shift through walls."
