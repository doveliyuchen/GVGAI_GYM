However, based on the existing layout, moving left or right at this position does not progress toward a goal because it hits walls or empty spaces.\n  \nFrom the current position of the `avatar` (7, 32):\n- **Up (6, 32)**: This is also a `p` (wall) \u2014 blocked.\n- **Down (8, 32)**: This is a `p` (wall) \u2014 blocked.\n- **Left (7, 31)**: This is a `p` (wall) \u2014 blocked.\n- **Right (7, 33)**: This is a `p` (wall) \u2014 blocked.\n\n### Rotation Expectation\nAs the `avatar` position is aimed toward moving up where the nearest passenger lies at (6, 9), but cannot move in any direction due to walls, the next action should rotate the avatar towards the upwards\u2019 direction.\n\nTherefore, according to the mechanics:\n1. Rotate the `avatar` upwards (which is the intended direction to reach the `passenger`); however, as there's no space available, this action should be re-evaluated.\n\nGiven the context, I will take a deliberate action to rotate instead, as there's nowhere to navigate successfully:\n\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\n\nThis action denotes moving **upwards**, and while it might not succeed due to walls being present, the intention is to reassess the layout for further moves once rotated.

    "content": "Given the current state of the game environment, the avatar is positioned at (row 8, col 33). The immediate surroundings and the possible actions should be considered carefully to proceed effectively.\n\n### Analyzing the Current State:\n1. The avatar (`a`) is at (8, 33).\n2. There's a wall (`p`) around in various positions, which restricts movement in certain directions.\n3. Notably, there's a passenger (`l`) directly below the avatar at (6, 9), and levers and joints are available, which can be utilized to manipulate the environment, including moving the `suitcase` for possible passenger interactions.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- **Left (2, 33)**: This would move the avatar to an empty space.\n- **Right (8, 34)**: This would move the avatar into another wall.\n- **Down (9, 33)**: This leads to a wall, an invalid move.\n- **Up (7, 33)**: This is another wall, thus also an invalid move.\n\nNone of the directional movements seem beneficial or productive given that they would either lead to a wall or simply remain in the same position.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nSince the last movement did not change the position, I need to explore where a change can happen without unintended consequences. An appropriate action at this stage would be to rotate towards a direction to seek out any new actionable opportunities for movement or leverage.\n\n### Selected Action:\nSince moving in the immediate surrounding directions is not viable, I will choose to rotate towards a direction to assess any potential next moves effectively without producing an immediate effect that leaves me stranded. Let's rotate right first.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect this action will allow the avatar to reorient and prepare for an appropriate move in your next turn. It is essential to analyze the influence of this rotation on available subsequent actions."

If you were to attempt to move left, it would be the only possible action since all other pathways around you are blocked.\n\nBased on these observations, I recommend the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to the empty space allows for more flexibility in subsequent moves. My expectation is that this aligns with avoiding obstacles and positioning for future actions in the game."
