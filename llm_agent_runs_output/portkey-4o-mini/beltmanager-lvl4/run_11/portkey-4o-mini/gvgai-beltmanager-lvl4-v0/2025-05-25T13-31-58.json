The goal is to collect passengers while maneuvering safely around obstacles and leveraging the available levers for additional paths.\n\nThe avatars possible movement actions are:\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)** : Move left to (row=9, col=31), an empty space.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)** : Move right to (row=9, col=33), an adjacent wall.\n- **ACTION_UP (4)** : Move up to (row=8, col=32), which is an empty space.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (3)** : Move down to (row=10, col=32), which is also an empty space.\n\n### Chosen Action\nGiven the current avatar position and the locations of the obstacles and the nearby passengers, I will proceed with **ACTION_UP (4)** to move to (row=8, col=32).
