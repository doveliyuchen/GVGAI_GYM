Our immediate surroundings include:\n\n- To the left (3, 15): a smoke (which can provide temporary invulnerability)\n- To the right (3, 17): a death smoke (which is dangerous)\n- Above (2, 16): a box (b)\n- Below (4, 16): a wall (*)\n\nGiven that the primary objective is to navigate safely and ultimately reach the exit (which is located at (11, 24)), I see the following effective strategy based on the current state:\n\n1. We can use the smoke to position ourselves safely before encountering any threats from the death.\n2. Since our last move doesn't change because there's a wall directly below, we need to ensure we are not blocked by walls.\n\nTo initiate this, I will take the action to move left, which should allow us to pick up the smoke (since it's safe), ideally improving our defense against the death sprite.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action of moving left allows me to access the smoke while staying safe, aligning well with our strategy to use it wisely and avoiding danger from death sprites."
