Understanding the surrounding tiles is crucial for planning the next move.\n\nLooking at the immediate surroundings of the avatar at (3, 17):\n- Up (2, 17): `%` (death smoke)\n- Left (3, 16): `d` (death smoke)\n- Down (4, 17): `*` (wall)\n- Right (3, 18): `$` (death ground)\n\nFrom this analysis, the avatar cannot move up or left to cells with death smoke, and the cell directly below is a wall. The only allowable move from the current position is right to (3, 18), which is a death ground but not lethal in this specific case since it doesn't impose immediate danger like the other options.\n\nTo adhere to the strategy:\n1.
