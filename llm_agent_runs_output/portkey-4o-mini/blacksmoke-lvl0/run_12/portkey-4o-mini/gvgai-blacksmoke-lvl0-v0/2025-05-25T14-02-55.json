The exit is located at **(row=11, col=24)**. \n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n1. **Avatar's Position**: At (3, 17), the avatar can potentially move or interact with nearby entities. \n2. **Nearby Hazards**: \n   - To the **left** at (3, 16) is the `death smoke` entity marked by '%', which will be hazardous if the avatar moves close to it without any protection.\n   - To the **right** (3, 18) is a `$`, indicating a safe ground.\n   - Above (2, 17) is also safe (`$`), and below it at (4, 17) is also a `$`.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Moves:\n- **Up ((row=2, col=17))**: Safe (a `$`).\n- **Down (row=4, col=17)**: Safe (a `$`).\n- **Left (row=3, col=16)**: Dangerous (a `%`).\n- **Right (row=3, col=18)**: Safe (a `$`).\n\nGiven the available options, the safest moves that allow continued navigation towards the exit would be either **up** or **down** as both lead to safe squares.\n\n### Action Selection:\nGiven our objective is to navigate toward the exit safely, moving **down** increases the score potential while keeping us clear of hazardous sprites.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move **down**:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to facilitate progress while avoiding immediate dangers."

There are walls surrounding the avatar, specifically to the left at (3, 16) and right at (3, 18). \n2. Below the avatar at (4, 17) is a wall, and above it at (2, 17) is an area that's open.\n3. To the right of the avatar, at (3, 18) is a `'$'`, which is a harmless area that could be navigated.\n\nConsidering the current state, the most viable move is to evaluate the elements above the avatar, as moving up would open a new path. We will choose to move up first and see if that leads to better options.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action aims to rotate the avatar up towards (2, 17) and allows exploration of new areas while avoiding unnecessary threats."

The presence of the 'smoke' (% symbol) to the left (row 3, col 16) could be useful for shielding from hazards if encountered. \n\nSince the avatar is positioned near a wall and there is no immediate movement possible without hitting obstacles, the best action here would be to approach the smoke:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nI expect this action to rotate the avatar towards the smoke and attempt to move left.
