Therefore, the action here would require reevaluation to avoid death.\n\n3. **Strategy Alignment**: \n   - Since resource management suggests collecting items (like smoke if it's available) and ensuring safe navigation, staying put might be the best option at this point to assess further potential actions.\n\nSince a directional action (up, down, left, or right) will not yield a beneficial outcome due to surrounding death elements, let's evaluate the situation:\n\n- The only action that could potentially give me time to assess or changes the situation without immediate penalty is to create smoke if possible, which might not directly apply here. The better option is **to do nothing in this scenario** until other resources (like shovels or keys) become available. \n\nThus, I will opt for:\n\n``` Action: 0 ``` \n\nFeedback: Choosing to remain idle allows us to assess the situation further as moving will result in certain death, contrary to the strategy of safe navigation."

The immediate surrounding of the avatar includes death smokespawn ('d') and death ground ('$'), but there are also some boxes ('@') nearby that may be moved or interacted with as necessary for progression.\n\nWe will analyze the potential actions to see if they align with the recommended strategy while accounting for the avatar's current position.\n\n### Action Plan\n- **Action UP (ACTION_UP)** would lead to (2, 21), encountering a death sprite. Not viable.\n- **Action DOWN (ACTION_DOWN)** would lead to (4, 21), which is an empty space ('*'), thus a safe option. \n- **Action LEFT (ACTION_LEFT)** would lead to (3, 20), which is also an empty space ('%'). \n- **Action RIGHT (ACTION_RIGHT)** would lead to (3, 22), safe space ('$') but doesn't progress toward the exit.\n- **Action USE (ACTION_USE)** is only viable if an object exists to be used at the current position.\n\nGiven the analysis, the optimal first step is to explore moving DOWN to ensure we have more room to navigate the area.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving down is a safe and effective choice, opening up more possibilities for subsequent actions toward reaching the exit."

Therefore, the avatar will need to remain in its current position and take an action other than movement.\n\n### Selected Action:\nSince no movement is possible, the best action in this scenario, according to game mechanics regarding surroundings, is to **use the shovel** to interact with the environment in an attempt to change the state.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing the shovel may help in creating a path or destroying an encountered wall or obstacle, in line with the overall strategy of solving puzzles."
