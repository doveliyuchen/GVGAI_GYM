The area between the avatar and the goal is clear of hazards (fire or water), but there are several obstacles (boxes '@') that will require strategic movement to navigate around.\n\nBased on the goal's position and the overall game mechanics:\n\n1. The first step is to move directly **upwards**, since this is the most straightforward path to the goal.\n2. I need to ensure that my movement allows for the avatar to progress towards the goal without colliding with any hazardous elements.\n\nExecuting the following action:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action is to move UP, which I expect will take the avatar one step closer to the goal, provided there are no obstacles in the way."
