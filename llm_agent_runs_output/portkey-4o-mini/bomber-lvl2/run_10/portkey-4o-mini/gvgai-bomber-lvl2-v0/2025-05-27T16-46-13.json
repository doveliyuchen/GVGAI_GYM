If I go further up, I can reach (7, 9), which is also clear.\n3. Continue moving up to (1, 9) directly, as there are no obstacles blocking this vertical path.\n\n### Step Towards the Goal:\nTo begin moving towards the green door (`#`), the first action is to move up from (9, 9) to (8, 9).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up should begin the progress towards the goal, aligning with the strategy of moving through clear paths."

There are walls '$' blocking many pathways, and several interactive elements present in the environment.\n\nGiven the surroundings:\n- You have a clear line of movement available vertically upwards towards the goal, as all cells above (8, 9) and (7, 9) until (1, 9) are either '.' or '#', allowing movement without obstruction.\n\nBased on the game rules and available actions, here are the observations and the ideal action to take:\n- **Action**: Since the upward path is clear and leads directly to the goal (#), the best action is to move **UP**.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action is expected to allow you to make significant progress towards the goal. By moving upwards, you're aiming to reach (8, 9), and then subsequently (7, 9) and ultimately the goal at (1, 9). Following this strategy aligns well with the objectives of navigating to the goal efficiently."
