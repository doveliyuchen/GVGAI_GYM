The objective is to reach the goal marked by `#` at (row=1, col=9). \n\nTo plan your next move, let's analyze the current surroundings:\n\n- **Surroundings of the Avatar (row=9, col=9):**\n  - Left (row=9, col=8) -> `@` (box)\n  - Right (row=9, col=10) -> `.` (empty)\n  - Up (row=8, col=9) -> `.` (empty)\n  - Down (row=10, col=9) -> `$` (wall)\n\nSince the goal is still far from your position, and the left side has a box, it is better to move towards the area with an empty space (right or up). Since both options are available, moving up (to row=8) may allow further exploration without obstruction.\n\nThus, the next action should be to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should help in exploring further while avoiding any boxes, and it aligns with the strategy of careful exploration towards the goal."

You need to navigate through the level while avoiding hazards and using available objects strategically.\n\n### Key Points:\n- The avatar's current position is safe since it's surrounded by the ground (.) and a few boxes (@).\n- The goal is two rows directly above, located at (1, 9).\n- The path to maneuver looks clear upwards along the same column.\n\n### Action Plan:\nYou should consider moving one step up to explore the level further towards the goal. The action \"UP\" is a good choice because it allows you to directly approach the goal without encountering any immediate hazards.\n\n``` Action:5 ```\nMoving up will be a step towards reaching the green door, aligning with the overall strategy of careful exploration towards the goal."

The objective is to reach the green door, indicated by the '#' sprite located at (1, 9). The avatar's surroundings consist of walls ('$'), boxes ('@'), and open spaces ('.').\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- The avatar can attempt to move in the following directions:\n  - Left (to (9, 8)), which is empty ('.').\n  - Right (to (9, 10)), which is empty ('.').\n  - Up (to (8, 9)), which is empty ('.'), but may potentially lead to more strategic paths as one explores.\n  - Down (to (10, 9)), which is blocked by a wall ('$').\n\nGiven the goal's position, I should prioritize moving up toward the row with fewer obstacles.\n\n### Next Move:\nI will move up to (8, 9). \n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis move should allow me to navigate closer to the goal while avoiding hazards, as there are multiple pathways open above."
