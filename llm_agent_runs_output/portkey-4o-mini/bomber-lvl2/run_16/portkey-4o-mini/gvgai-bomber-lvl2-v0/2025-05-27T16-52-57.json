Given the current layout, the avatar can further explore options in horizontal movement since the vertical space seems limited due to the walls ('$').\n\n### Current Options:\nFrom position (9, 2), available directional actions are:\n- Moving LEFT to (9, 1) where there is a box ('@').\n- Moving DOWN to (10, 2) would result in hitting a wall ('$').\n\n### Decision and Action:\nThe most beneficial move would be to approach and interact with the box directly adjacent to the left (9, 1).
