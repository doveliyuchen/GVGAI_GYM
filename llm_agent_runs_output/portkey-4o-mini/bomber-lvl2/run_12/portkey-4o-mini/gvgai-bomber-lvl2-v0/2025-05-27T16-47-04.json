There are several obstacles (represented as '@') and paths (represented as '.') in between. The main objective is to navigate through this maze-like structure to reach the goal while avoiding hazards like water ('.').\n\nHere's a brief look at the immediate surroundings of the avatar:\n- Moving up to (8, 9) is a box '@'.\n- Moving down to (10, 9) is an empty ground ','.\n- Moving left to (9, 8) is an empty ground ','.\n- Moving right to (9, 10) is also an empty ground ','.\n\n1. Since the avatar cannot move directly up due to the box obstruction and there are no hazards immediately to the left or right, moving down seems to provide an opportunity to explore further paths below with no immediate danger.\n\n2. I will move down (to (10, 9)), which is a clear move without immediate threats and could position us to navigate toward the goal.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving down should present an opportunity to explore more of the layout and strategically plan the next steps toward reaching the goal."

To reach the goal, I need to navigate upward while avoiding obstacles.\n\n1. **Analyzing Availabilities:** \n   - Directly above my position (row 8, column 9) there is a box ('@'), which will block any attempt to move up.\n   - I can reach the box above by moving up but won\u2019t be able to progress further without solving the blocking issue.\n   - Furthermore, I need to consider the win condition; I must reach the goal while managing the constraints of time.\n\n2. **Next Steps:** \n   - To proceed better, I must look for bombs ('b') which can help clear boxes. The nearest box is above me at (8, 9).\n   - I have no direct bombs available next to me right now to clear the path, so I should consider lateral movements instead.\n\n3. **Action Mechanism:**\n   - Since my previous position didn't change upon the last possible action (which I assume is an action I took that didn\u2019t lead to movement), I should now move right to assess if there\u2019s a route to the remaining bomb supply or look for additional routes.\n\nGiven that I need to plan my move strategically\u2014aiming for resources or clearing obstacles\u2014I'll take a step to the right:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis should allow me to look for alternatives to overcome barriers before aiming for the goal."
