Since the position hasn't been specified in terms of actions before, I can opt for a movement action in the upward direction to progress towards the goal.\n\nGiven that the upward path (ACTION_UP) seems to be the next best move and is important for progressing towards the goal, I will choose to move up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nI expect this action will move the avatar closer to the goal without any hazards in the immediate path."
