To ensure my avatar is moving strategically, I will move **LEFT**. However, given that the avatar is at the far left of the map, there will be no change in position if I try to go left. Thus, the next action should be checking the remaining options that may not put my avatar into immediate danger from the chase enemy.\n\nMoving **UP** towards (row 8, col 0) would keep my distance from the chase enemies aligning vertically (row 1) and potentially lead to a better position to fire.
