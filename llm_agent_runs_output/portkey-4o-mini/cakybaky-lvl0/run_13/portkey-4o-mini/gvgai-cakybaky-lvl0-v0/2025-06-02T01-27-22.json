This is the third resource I need to collect, but I currently have not collected `inc1` (ingredient `1`) or `inc2` (ingredient `2`) yet based on the rules.\n  - The next valid ingredient in order would be from collecting the `1` and `2` first before `#`.\n  \n- Obstacles nearby:\n  - Chef (`@`) appears four times at various positions, notably at (row 5, 17) and (row 6, 8, 17, 18). I must navigate carefully to avoid colliding with these enemies.\n\n- Path Analysis:\n  - My current column indicates an open path but I need to avoid areas with chefs, especially since some move towards my current position based on the rules of movement. \n\n### Strategy:\nAs I cannot collect any resources right now (since I'm missing `1` and `2`), my first action must be to navigate towards available resources without hitting the chefs. The nearest resource that I can collect is at row 10, column 5 which is ingredient `&` (denoting `inc6`). However, given that I can't collect it without first collecting earlier resources, I need to move left towards row 10, column 1 where there are no obstacles and plan my moves accordingly later.\n\n### Action Selection:\n- I will take the first action to move left to avoid chef encounters and to see what my next options are.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left into an unoccupied cell could help me plan my next actions without immediate threats. Let's proceed to reassess the layout after this move."

The immediate action should be to navigate towards the ingredient, starting with moving right.\n2. After evaluating the map, moving right will place the avatar at (10, 2), which is still a safe position to collect the ingredient while planning against the chef's potential movement towards my position.\n\nSince a left action isn't feasible due to a wall, the best course is to use the right action.\n\n### Action decision:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action allows me to move closer to the ingredient while maintaining a safe distance from the chef and keeping in line with the resource collection strategy. I expect to be moving towards collecting the ingredient, keeping the game objective in focus."
