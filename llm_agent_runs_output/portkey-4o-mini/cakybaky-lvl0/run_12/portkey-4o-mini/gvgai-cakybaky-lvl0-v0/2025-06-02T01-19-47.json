Movement towards the flour (1, 4) from (6, 13) would require navigating through rows where chefs are present.\n\n### Proposed Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Chefs:** Given that the chefs are in adjacent cells to the left side of the avatar\u2019s column (column 13), we need to avoid direct interactions with them.\n2. **Path to Flour:** The best feasible direction to maneuver toward the resource is to move either UP or LEFT to avoid confrontation.\n\n### Next Move:\nThe avatar will first need to rotate towards the immediate surroundings since it is facing downward (considering the rows are incremented downwards), which poses an immediate risk given the close proximity of the chefs. \n\nTo safely move toward the flour while rotating away from the chefs:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will rotate the avatar to the left. Once rotated, a subsequent movement upward can be conducted if safe, ensuring that I do not directly engage with the chefs immediately neighboring my current position.
