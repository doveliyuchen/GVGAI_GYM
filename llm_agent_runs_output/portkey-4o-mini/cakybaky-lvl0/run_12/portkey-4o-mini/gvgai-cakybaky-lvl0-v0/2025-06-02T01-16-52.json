This does not lead directly to collecting flour, but it allows strategic distance from the chef and keeps all options to collect flour next.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI expect this will ensure my avatar avoids a loss condition and still keeps the possibility open to access the ingredient efficiently later."
