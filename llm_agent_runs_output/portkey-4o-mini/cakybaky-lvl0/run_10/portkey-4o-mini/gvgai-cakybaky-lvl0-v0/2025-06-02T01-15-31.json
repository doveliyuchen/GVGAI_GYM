Since the position doesn\u2019t change, action analysis will be essential to devise the next move.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The goal is to move towards the `#` at (1, 4) to collect the first resource (inc1), but the chef's proximity makes it essential to navigate carefully to avoid conflict.\n- Moving upwards (to (2, 8)) does not seem wise since there's a chef located nearby (2, 11 and 2, 12) which could lead to being cornered.\n- Moving left to (3, 7) keeps the avatar away from immediate danger while also positioning for future moves.\n\n### Best Action Based on Analysis:\nGiven the current considerations and strategic goals, moving left to (3, 7) is a logical step.
