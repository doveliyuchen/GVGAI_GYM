The closest exit is at (11, 10). So, I need to explore moving in different directions, especially down to the interactable box at (9, 7).\n\n2. **Available Actions**:\n   - LEFT (to (11, 5)): takes me away from the exit.\n   - RIGHT (to (11, 7)): closer to the box, but I can't move through walls.\n   - DOWN (to (12, 6)): this leads down but moves me away from the key box to interact with.\n   - UP (to (10, 6)): this opens an option but doesn't directly aid in reaching my objective.\n\nGiven the scenario, I realize the most meaningful action is to first move DOWN to explore options and find a pathway that may lead towards pushing the box or repositioning to earn higher points later.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nI will proceed with the action to move DOWN towards (12, 6) while exploring new potential pathways.
