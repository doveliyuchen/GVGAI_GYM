Based on the layout, my immediate goal is to strategically position boxes while managing interactions with holes and optimizing my ability to reach the exit at (11, 10) while also scoring points from interactions.\n\nGiven the layout:\n\n- The nearest box is at (2, 10) with an interactive hole away from it.\n- There are exit points available at (11, 10) for my avatar to reach.\n\nI must first determine if the avatar's positioning allows for a straightforward action. In evaluating the options, I find that I need to check if a left action could lead to a box interaction.\n\n### Current Actions:\n1. **Left** - (11, 7): This action might not provide movement, as there is a wall at (11, 7).\n2. **Right** - (11, 9): There is a wall at (11, 9) as well.\n3. **Up** - (10, 8): This would lead the avatar to (10, 8) without interaction.\n4. **Down** - (12, 8): This leads below the current row.\n\nSince moving left results in hitting a wall and moving up doesn't aid in reaching the exit, I should focus on creating a pathway or manipulating boxes to eventually progress towards the exit.\n\nAfter considering the layout with respect to available actions, my next course of action should be to move **down** (12, 8) to access the next series of spaces.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThe expected outcome is to explore the lower rows where potential box placements or other scoring opportunities may arise.
