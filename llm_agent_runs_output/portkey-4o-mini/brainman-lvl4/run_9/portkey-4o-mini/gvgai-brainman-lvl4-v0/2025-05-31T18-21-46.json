Moving left will keep the avatar in the same row but lead to free space (3, 2).\n2. Moving right will continue to free space (3, 4).\n\nSince the wall above and below the avatar restricts vertical movement, the best action to change the position while remaining on a safe path is to move **right**.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action shifts the avatar from (3, 3) to (3, 4), positioning them closer to the exit horizontally, and maintains strategy by avoiding hazards on the current path."

Moving **up** to (2, 3) takes me closer to the top row, but I would still need to navigate quite a bit to reach the exit.\n2.
