To proceed, the avatar will need to interact with the door, which requires a key.\n\n### Available Actions Review\n- The viable directional actions for the avatar currently are: left (to (3, 2)), right (to the door at (3, 5)), up (to (2, 3)), or down (to (4, 3)).\n\n### Strategy Consideration\nSince there is no immediate movement of the avatar indicated from the last state, the decision should be to move towards the door. Collecting keys is essential due to their role in unlocking doors, and it appears there are keys further down the column or to the sides, but interaction with the door at this moment may enhance gameplay. \n\nMoreover, moving right will allow the avatar to interact with a door, assuming there is already a sufficient key available (as we can see the key at (2, 7) but it's uncertain if we currently have it).\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is to move the avatar right to interact with the door, which is part of the strategic plan to reach the exit while managing the nearby obstacles effectively. I expect to either unlock the door or see the avatar interact with the nearby objects or collectibles."

Currently, the left (3, 1) and right (3, 3) options are viable. Moving left or right from (3, 2) will lead to an empty space and allows further exploration, while moving down or up is not possible.\n\n### Future Considerations\nAfter moving, we can plan our next step. It is also important to try to collect at least one of the keys available (located close at (2, 7) or (2, 12)) on future turns.\n\n### Chosen Action\nBased on the board layout and current avatar position, I will move to the right to (3, 3) to continue exploring and potentially access doors in future turns as there might be some progression towards the exit at (1, 14).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to advance and explore more options toward the exit and keep collecting more resources strategically."

However, the path to the exit remains the primary objective. So, collecting the key can be beneficial for unlocking future doors, while moving up and to the right allows for further exploration.\n\n### Decision Making\nSince directly moving left would allow for the collection of the key, and no other advantageous actions can be executed from the current position (up or right heading toward more gems or important elements), I will opt to collect the key now.\n\n### Action Selection\n``` Action: 1 ```\nCollecting the key immediately enhances both current resources and potential for future interactions with doors.

    "content": "Currently, the avatar ('a') is positioned at (row=3, col=2) and the adjacent tiles need to be analyzed for possible moves. \n\n### Tile Analysis for Movement\n- **Up (2, 2)**: The tile contains a wall ('*'), so movement is blocked.\n- **Down (4, 2)**: There is another wall ('*'), so movement is also blocked.\n- **Left (3, 1)**: This tile is empty ('.'), movement is possible.\n- **Right (3, 3)**: This tile is empty ('.'), movement is possible.\n\n### Current Position: (3, 2)\nThe avatar can either move left to (3, 1) or right to (3, 3). \n\n### Strategy Alignment\nGiven the strategy of positioning and not having moved the avatar at the last action, a different action should be taken from the previous state. Since the avatar is surrounded by walls on the up and down positions, it makes sense to explore left or right.\n\nChoosing to move **right** (to (3, 3)) keeps options open, as there are multiple pathways in that direction.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect to see the avatar move to (3, 3) and open up more exploration routes while avoiding tight spaces."
