    "content": "Given the current state, it looks like the avatar ('a') is located at (3, 2) in the map. There are several interactable items nearby, including several keys ('%') and a door ('#'). \n\nTo progress towards a win, we need to collect keys, navigate around obstacles, and eventually reach the exit ('$') at (1, 14). Currently, there are no immediate dangers around the avatar, but careful navigation is needed to avoid any hazards and ensure safe movement.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n- The avatar can move left (to (3, 1)), up (to (2, 2)), down (to (4, 2)), or right (to (3, 3)). \n- Moving left or right will keep the avatar moving on the same row where it can interact with keys and the door.\n- The upward option leads to a space that has a boulder (@) below at (2, 4), which could block movement if I am not careful.\n- Moving down (to (4, 2)) will keep the avatar in a safe position, but there are no collectible items in that row.\n\nPrioritizing the collection of keys while ensuring the avatar's safe navigation towards the exit could be the best strategy. \n\nI will choose to move left to (3, 1) and check for further opportunities from there.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will allow for better positioning to potentially collect keys and assess dangers or obstacles."
