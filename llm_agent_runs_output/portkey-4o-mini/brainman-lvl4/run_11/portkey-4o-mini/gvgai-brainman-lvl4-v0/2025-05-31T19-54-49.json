The objective remains to navigate towards the exit while avoiding dangers.\n\n### Observing Surroundings:\n- At (3, 1) there's a key missile ('w').\n- At (3, 3) and (3, 4) is empty space and a boulder door ('c') respectively.\n- To the right, at (3, 3) is also an open pathway leading up to the exit at (1, 14).\n\n### Action Analysis:\nThe next logical move is to first pick up the key missile since it can be very useful in manipulating other game elements. Thus, moving left to (3, 1) to collect the key missile seems appropriate.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to collect the key missile and further engage with game mechanics effectively while moving strategically toward the exit."

Since I have a key missile right to my left (row=3, col=1), I can pick it up by moving left.\n2. After this, I can either use the key missile to interact with walls/boulders or start moving towards the exit.\n\n### Initial Action Decision:\nMoving left will allow me to collect more resources (key missile), which could be beneficial for progressing through doors or obstacles.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nCollecting the key missile could provide opportunities for strategic manipulation of obstacles as I aim for the exit."

After collecting the key missile, we may look for ways to interact with doors or potentially use it strategically.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe logical first step here is to move left to collect the key missile.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis movement should allow me to gain the key missile, which is a beneficial first step in managing the environment and preparing for the next actions toward reaching the exit."
