Move up (2, 2), blocked by a wall (*).\n\nGiven that the left movement to (3, 1) will allow access to a key which might be beneficial for opening subsequent doors, and no movement to the other adjacent spaces is immediately viable, the optimal action is:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will help collect a key and prepare for further interactions with the boulder door (#) and potential exits."
