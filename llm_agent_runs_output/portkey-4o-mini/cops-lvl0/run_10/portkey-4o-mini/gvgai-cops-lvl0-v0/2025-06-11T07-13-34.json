I can move left, right, or down, but left (to (2, 10)) is vacant, while down would lead to another wall.\n3. Engaging with enemies directly isn't possible, since the nearest enemy (the red thug at (11, 1) and (12, 1)) are far below the current line.\n\nFor this turn:\n- I will move left to (2, 10) because this is a vacant space; it does not engage with enemies but does provide a strategic opportunity to check surrounding areas on the next turns, since movement in that direction opens up more floor spaces.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of maneuvering effectively through the level while keeping an eye on time and resources.
