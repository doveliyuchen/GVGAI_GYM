The immediate goal is to prepare to engage with the enemies (which are located nearby) and gather resources while keeping an eye on the time.\n\nTo optimize movement towards collecting keys or defeating enemies, I will move the avatar in the most beneficial direction based on the provided game strategy. It's advisable to aim for the areas that are open and will lead us closer to enemies or resources.\n\nI will take the action of moving **up** (ACTION_UP) to precisely navigate through the map since the area above shows only walls and open areas which might lead to encounters or other resource opportunities strategically.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up will help me position myself closer to the row of open resources above while still being cautious of enemy positioning. I expect this aligns with the strategy to engage enemies effectively while avoiding being trapped."
