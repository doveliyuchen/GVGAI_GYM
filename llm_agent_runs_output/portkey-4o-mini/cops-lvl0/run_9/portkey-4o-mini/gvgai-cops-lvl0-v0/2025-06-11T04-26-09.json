However, they don't seem to be an immediate threat since they are not obstructing your path but can be beneficial for point collection if engaged carefully.\n2. **Avoidance of Boss Threat**: The boss is far down the map and currently not a concern.

East and down directions are blocked by walls as well as the yellow thug (d) at (11, 12).\n\nSince the avatar has not moved from its last state, I need to consider a different action. The effective move would be to explore lower rows where the thugs are located and potentially defeat them for points while avoiding confrontation with any nearby threats.\n\nGiven that we should ideally avoid movement that could lead to enemy encounters and instead focus on collecting resources, I\u2019ll opt to move left (which aligns with the goal of heading toward resources while avoiding walls and enemies).\n\n```Action: 1```\n\nThis action allows me to reposition strategically while keeping an eye on potential threats.

The most promising action is to either move left or right to gather information and look for potential keys or villains to defeat.\n\n- Moving **right (to Row 6, Column 8)** would keep options open and continue exploration towards any future path. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action keeps you in an open area for exploration and avoids confrontation while positioning you closer to the right side of the map where you might find more resources."
