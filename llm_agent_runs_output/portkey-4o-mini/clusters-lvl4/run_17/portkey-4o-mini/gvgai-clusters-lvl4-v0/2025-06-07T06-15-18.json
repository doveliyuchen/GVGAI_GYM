Moving down is not an option due to the wall.\n\n4. **Strategic Focus**: According to the game objectives, we need to remove all the boxes while managing the positioning and timing effectively. Since there are nearby neutral squares to move, going left or right allows further exploration of the environment.\n\n### Chosen Action\nAfter analyzing the closest positions, moving to the **left (8, 5)** is beneficial, with no immediate obstacles or holes. This move keeps options open for future interactions with any nearby boxes or further strategizing. \n\nI will proceed with:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is strategic as it opens new paths to interact with potential box locations in subsequent moves."

Moving down seems safe but doesn't help in removing any boxes. \n\n### Recommended Action\nThe most strategic action is to **move up** to interact with the green box.
