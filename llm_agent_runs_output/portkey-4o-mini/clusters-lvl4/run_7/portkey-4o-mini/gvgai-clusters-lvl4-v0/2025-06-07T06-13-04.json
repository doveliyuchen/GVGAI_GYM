I expect this move will position me for a successful next turn where I can deal with the green box."

However, the strategy suggests prioritizing box destruction, and I notice that a box is located at (5, 11) and (8, 11). The best course of action now is to move toward one of those boxes to start eliminating them.\n\nSince I am currently positioned at (7, 5), the best available action is to move up (to (6, 5)). This allows me to continue assessing opportunities for interaction without hitting boundaries or hazards that would lead to loss.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to provide further exploration of the level, especially towards starting the box destruction process when positioned closer to a box."

    "content": "Given the state of the game, your avatar ('a') is currently positioned at (6, 5), and it is surrounded by various elements including walls, boxes, and hazards (holes and blocks). \n\nAnalyzing the immediate surroundings, it looks like the avatar has a blue box ('#') directly to the right at (6, 4) and a hole ('&') at (6, 6) which poses a danger. The walls are located at (0, x) and (9, x), meaning no movement is possible upward or downward.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the avatar's position has not changed, we should consider the action leading to another rotation or potential movement this turn based on the provided actions. We want to manipulate the blue box first since eliminating boxes is the primary objective. \n\n1. Attempt **ACTION_LEFT (2)** to see if it allows access to the blue box directly:\n- If the action results in rotation without collision, the avatar must act again to proceed. \n\nGiven that the avatar is currently at (6, 5), moving left to (6, 4) is safe as it leads to the blue box, and it maintains a safe distance from the hole at (6, 6).\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left towards the blue box puts us in position to potentially eliminate a box in subsequent turns while avoiding hazards, which aligns with the strategy established."
