The most straightforward action would be to move left to that box.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis move should allow the avatar to interact with the green box to potentially eliminate or manipulate it, thus progressing toward the goal of clearing all boxes."

The green box located at (5, 3) is within reach, considering the available pathways toward it.\n2. The avatar has options to move in several directions; however, moving DOWN is blocked by walls and the closest reachable box is above.\n3. A TURN adjustment will be required to head towards the box at (5, 3) and must scan the area continually to ensure no interactions would lead to dangers (like falling into the holes).\n\nTherefore, let's execute the action to move UP towards the box at (5, 3).\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action will position the avatar closer to the first box, facilitating the next move toward clearing boxes without interacting with any threats."
