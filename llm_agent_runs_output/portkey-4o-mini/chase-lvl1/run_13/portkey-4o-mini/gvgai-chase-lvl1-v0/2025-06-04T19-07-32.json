Engaging this sprite can help in attempting to turn it into a carcass (if the game mechanics allow).\n\n### Movement Options:\nSince moving left is not viable due to the angry sprite:\n- Right (to (8, 22)): This will push the avatar into a space with a wall, effectively immobilizing it.\n- Down (to (9, 21)): This space is currently open and moving down would also help reposition away from the angry sprite.\n- Up (to (7, 21)): This would also result in direct confrontation with the angry sprite.\n\nGiven these assessments, the best action is to **move down** to (9, 21), maintaining distance from the angry sprite while opening up future options.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down places the avatar in a safe position and prepares for the next move.
