The other mechanics need to be taken into account, especially that the avatar cannot pass through walls and must plan its movements carefully.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Move Toward the Scared Sprite:** The avatar should probably move to (3, 22) to interact with the scared sprite directly. This requires moving down from (3, 17) to (4, 17), which can be risky as it puts the avatar in direct contact with the angry sprite.\n  \n2. **Safe Actions:** Instead of moving down towards the angry sprite, a lateral movement will be a safer option.\n\nThe best immediate action appears to be moving left to (3, 16). This allows the avatar to reposition away from the angry sprite while still being in a good position to later approach the scared sprite.\n\n### Action Decision\nMoving left from (3, 17) to (3, 16) is safe because it avoids any immediate threat from the angry sprite, keeping the avatar out of danger.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will reposition the avatar safely and maintain a good distance from potential threats, aligning with the strategy of avoiding aggression."

There is also an angry sprite (`$`) located at (4, 16), very close to the avatar.\n\n### Strategy and Analysis:\nGiven the rules and the situation, the primary goals are to eliminate the scared sprites while avoiding the angry sprite to prevent losing points.\n\n1. **Avoiding the Angry Sprite:** The angry sprite is located directly to the left of the avatar at (4, 16). The avatar needs to be cautious about moving. It is essential to create a plan that avoids contact with the angry sprite.\n\n2. **Engaging Scared Sprites:** The avatar should focus on interacting with the scared sprites that are located one row above at (1, 22) and directly below at (4, 22).\n\n3. **Movement Decision:**\n   - Moving to the left (ACTION_LEFT) would cause the avatar to come into contact with the angry sprite, leading to a loss.\n   - Other directions like UP (ACTION_UP to (2, 16)), DOWN (ACTION_DOWN to (4, 16)), and RIGHT (ACTION_RIGHT to (3, 17)) do not get the avatar closer to the scared sprites.\n\nGiven the situation, the best and safest immediate action is to move UP to position (2, 16), which is safe and moves vertically away from nearby threats while positioning the avatar to potentially move towards the scared sprite below at (4, 22) in future turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nThis action will take the avatar up to (2, 16), where it avoids immediate danger and prepares to engage with the scared sprites in subsequent moves."

    "content": "The current state of the game world shows the avatar located at (row=4, col=16), surrounded by walls, with several scared sprites scattered throughout the levels, particularly at (row=1, col=22), (row=2, col=22), (row=3, col=22), (row=4, col=22), and (row=5, col=22). Additionally, there is an angry sprite located at (row=5, col=16) that I must avoid to prevent losing points.\n\nGiven these conditions, the best strategy would be to move closer to the scared sprite at (row=4, col=22), while being cautious of the angry sprite directly to my left. The available movement options from (row=4, col=16) are to move left to (row=4, col=15) or possibly to another direction that won't compromise my safety.\n\nTo execute this plan, I will first attempt to move left towards (row=4, col=15):\n\n```Action:1```\n\nThis move is intended to navigate closer to the target scared sprite while remaining aware of my surroundings, particularly the angry sprite. I expect to see the avatar shift to (row=4, col=15) without encountering any walls. If this action leads to new possible routes towards the scared sprite, I will reassess my next move based on the new state."
