Your main objective is to collect or transform `scared` sprites while avoiding any interaction that will lead to a negative score.\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The avatar is surrounded primarily by walls, with only potential for movement up or down depending on wall constraints. There are no `scared` sprites immediately adjacent to you.\n2. The score loss condition is critical; we need to keep the avatar separate from `angry` sprites and ensure not to run out of `avatar` sprites.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nSince your avatar is currently situated in a space with limited options, and you have the potential to move up to row 8 (where there are more options to navigate, albeit still with walls), this seems like a strategic move.\n\nI will execute the action to move the avatar **up** to potentially explore the area further and seek opportunities to transmute `scared` sprites.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to reassess the new state and the adjacent positions of `scared` sprites without facing immediate danger from an `angry` sprite.

However, based on the game's rules, I should be cautious of any potential transformations or interactions that could happen based on movement. Given that the avatar's position can potentially remain the same if the movement is blocked by walls or there are rotations, I need to ensure that I take a meaningful action.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Plan for Transformation:** Since my avatar is surrounded by empty spaces, I should look to move toward areas where transformations or sprite collection can happen. Currently, there aren't any nearby scared sprites (@) that I can transform.\n2. **Avoid Walls:** I need to avoid any walls and generate a strategic position that leverages the current empty space.\n3. **Maintain Avatar Count:** Since I'm playing as the avatar, I need to ensure I don't move into any situation where transformations may lead to losing my position.\n\n### Move Decision:\nGiven the immediate surroundings, one viable action is to move downwards (ACTION_DOWN) to the empty space at (row=8, col=4). This keeps options open for future moves and does not endanger my avatar by moving toward any walls.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nThis action keeps the avatar in a safe position and opens up more options for exploration in the next turn."

To achieve this, it's important to navigate the game grid effectively while avoiding any potential threats like `angry` sprites and walls that block movement.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- Your current position is at (7, 4).\n- There are `scared` sprites located at:\n  - (1, 20), (1, 21), (1, 22)\n  - (2, 22)\n  - (3, 22)\n- There are walls (#) surrounding many areas you want to explore, which limits your movement options.\n\n### Strategic Pathing:\nTo achieve meaningful progress, moving towards the `scared` sprites would be beneficial. The closest `scared` sprite is at (3, 22) directly below your current position. This would be a logical move towards fulfilling your objectives.\n\nPerforming an action to move down would change your position to (8, 4), which will allow you to explore the area further and possibly collect the `scared` sprites.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves you down towards the `scared` sprite that is on row 3, column 22. I expect to navigate closer to that sprite, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves."

Given the position `(8, 8)` of the `avatar`, the next immediate moves should allow for potential interaction with `scared` sprites.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **Left (8, 7)** - Moving left keeps you within a grid with minimal interference and closer towards the `scared` sprites above.\n2. **Right (8, 9)** - This could lead towards additional hidden paths but might move away from the `scared` sprites.\n3. **Down (9, 8)** - Moves deeper into the bottom row with limited interactions.\n4. **Up (7, 8)** - This move would also bring you closer to the row with multiple `scared` sprites.\n\n### Choosing Action:\nMoving **up** to `(7, 8)` positions your avatar in a way where multiple interactions with `scared` sprites become possible in future turns. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up is a strategic choice to maximize potential interactions while avoiding confrontation with `angry` sprites."

To achieve your victory condition, the strategy recommends you avoid collisions with \"angry\" sprites and focus on collecting or transforming \"scared\" sprites (\"@\") while managing your avatar count.\n\n### Current Layout Analysis:\n- **Nearby \"scared\" Sprites:** There are \"scared\" sprites located at (1,20), (1,21), (1,22), (2,22), (3,22), and (4,22).\n- **Walls:** The surrounding area has several walls (#) that may block movement.\n- **Your Position:** Your avatar is currently in an open spot, allowing for potential movement.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. Move **UP** (to (8,6)): This space is clear with no interaction.\n2. Move **DOWN** (to (10,6)): This space is blocked by a wall (#).\n3. Move **LEFT** (to (9,5)): This space is clear with no interaction.\n4. Move **RIGHT** (to (9,7)): This space is clear with no interaction.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nTo pursue a strategy that maximizes engagement with the \"scared\" sprites, the best action will be to move **LEFT** (to (9,5)). By doing this, you will explore a direction that could potentially lead you toward subsequent moves to collect scared sprites while avoiding danger from any \"angry\" sprites in close proximity.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow your avatar to reposition and explore further while still avoiding immediate threats. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy of avoiding confrontation and finding a path toward winning conditions."

It keeps us in an unblocked area while potentially allowing us to explore further or position ourselves to engage with any frightened sprites in the next turn.\n\n### Decision\nI choose to move:\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up should allow for better positioning and exploration of the area without running into dangers, aligning with the overall strategy of managing the avatar safety."

Surrounding my avatar, there are walls (#) to the north and east, and additional obstacles or empty spaces to the south and west. The closest `scared` sprites (@) are located at (row=1, col=20), (row=1, col=21), (row=1, col=22), (row=2, col=22), (row=3, col=22), and (row=4, col=22). It's important to strategize a path to either interact with these `scared` sprites while avoiding any possible negative score implications from `angry` sprites.\n\nSince my current position does not change, I need to take an action that aligns with moving towards a useful interaction. The only available directions to move freely (without encountering a wall) would be towards the left (col=7) or down (row=10). Moving down to (row=10, col=8) seems to lead into an area filled with walls and would not bring any benefits strategically since there is no movement towards collecting or transforming sprites. \n\nTo meaningfully interact with the environment and potentially target the `scared` sprites, I should consider moving left first.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left towards col=7 does not appear to yield immediate benefits, but it keeps my options open for future moves since it allows for possible pathways in subsequent moves."
