I have to keep an eye on my position each turn and ensure that I interact with the right sprites effectively to eliminate them.\n\nGiven my current position and the surrounding states, I can move to (9, 7) by going down from (9, 6) where there are no immediate threats.\n\nI will take the action to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action positions me closer to a row where I can access multiple scared sprites in future moves, complying with the game's objective of eliminating them. I also expect that this position won't immediately lead to danger as there are no angry sprites in close proximity."

The closest `@` sprites are at `(1, 4)` and `(2, 4)`, but there is a distance to cover since the avatar must move through the level.\n   \n2. **Movement Consideration**: Since the avatar is currently at `(9, 10)`, most actions that would move left, down, or up should be evaluated based on possible encounters with `angry` sprites. However, there are no `angry` sprites listed near the avatar, meaning we can proceed cautiously.\n\n### Planned Action\nGiven that moving left or down seems to put us further from the immediate goal of reaching the scared sprites, let's determine where we can effectively begin to remove scared sprites.\n\n- **Action Right (`ACTION_RIGHT`)**: If I move right to `(9, 11)`, it confirms there are more open spaces to my right for future movement. However, this does not immediately help remove any scared sprites.\n  \n- **Action Up (`ACTION_UP`)**: Moving up to `(8, 10)`, gets me closer to open spaces with potential for movement. Similarly, it does not directly lead to the realization of my goals.\n\n- **Action Left (`ACTION_LEFT`)**: This could be an option to explore other sections of the map towards the left.\n\n### Move\nThus, the action I will take is to **move left**, as it opens up exploration potential while maintaining the goal of approaching scared sprites.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left will provide an opportunity to explore new spaces while keeping in mind my goal of reaching the scared sprites."

Going **LEFT** or **RIGHT** is not applicable since both will either lead me to a wall or remain in the same row without impactful movement.\n\nAfter analyzing the state and considering the action rules, I will proceed with the **UP** action to move closer to the scared sprites, allowing for further strategic movements in the next steps.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move positions me closer to the scared sprites for the next turn and allows me to strategize effectively in the following action based on their movement or interactions."
