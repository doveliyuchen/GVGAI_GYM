Moving left or right would only change my avatar's position without interacting with any significant game elements. However, given I have a box directly above me, I can aim to bounce upwards by moving up into that box.\n\nThus, I will take action to move up:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should engage with the box and potentially lead to further strategic movements afterwards. I expect to see my avatar move to (8, 6) and then be able to interact with the box above."

Based on the layout of the map, I can see that there are boxes, walls, hazards (holes), and an exit, as well as mechanisms I can interact with.\n\n**Analysis of the Current State:**\n- The immediate movement options from my position (9, 6) include:\n  - Up (to (8, 6), which is a wall 'r')\n  - Down (to (10, 6), which is a wall 'r')\n  - Left (to (9, 5), which is empty '.')\n  - Right (to (9, 7), which is empty '.')\n\nSince the upward and downward directions are blocked by walls, the viable moves are left or right.\n\n**Strategy Suggestion Based on Scoring and Objective:**\n1. Moving left (to (9, 5)) would lead the avatar to an empty space but does not seem to lead towards any objectives (e.g., boxes or switches).\n2. Moving right (to (9, 7)), however, keeps options open for future moves and getting closer to interacting with other elements (e.g., boxes). \n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose to move right to keep progressing towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action helps maintain exploration towards interacting with potential game elements and avoiding hazards effectively. I expect that moving right will open up new pathways and keep me progressing toward the win condition."

The exit ('%') is at (row=2, col=16), and I need to find a path toward it while avoiding hazards such as holes ('h').\n\n### Analyzing the State:\n- The immediate surroundings of my avatar:\n  - Up (row=8, col=7): empty space (.)\n  - Left (row=9, col=6): box ($)\n  - Right (row=9, col=8): green box (*)\n  - Down (row=10, col=7): wall (r)\n\n### Current Action Plan:\n1. I can use the box to the left or the green box to the right.\n2. However, moving up seems to be the only viable way to navigate since the down direction is blocked by a wall, and both left and right options are not leading toward the exit effectively.\n3. Moving up will allow me to explore further.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the action to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect moving up will provide opportunities to explore other areas that are clearer and possibly lead me closer to the exit while assessing hazards."

The surrounding tiles include holes ('h'), boxes ('n', '$'), and a variety of other interactable elements.\n\nTo navigate effectively, I will look to move towards the exit (represented as '%') while avoiding holes and strategizing interactions with the boxes. Since I have not moved since the last analysis, I need to determine if a new action is necessary.\n\nThe exit '%' is located at (2, 16), above my current position. The holes significantly affect my movement, so I should plan my next move carefully.\n\nCurrent possible actions based on my position:\n- Moving **UP (7, 7)** to a box which allows interactions.\n- Moving **DOWN (9, 7)** to an empty tile.\n- Moving **LEFT (8, 6)** to an empty tile.\n- Moving **RIGHT (8, 8)** to another box.\n\nI'll choose to move **UP (to 7, 7)** since it puts me directly on a box, allowing for further strategic positioning.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nMoving up to a box will enhance my opportunities for subsequent moves, aligning with the strategy of box management and positioning to reach toward the exit while avoiding hazards."

In this case, moving left to the blue box allows for the possibility of bouncing and utilizing the transformation mechanism linked to switching.\n\nI'll take the action to move left:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action should effectively position the avatar beside the box for future interactions, aligning with the strategy of using the box's properties efficiently."
