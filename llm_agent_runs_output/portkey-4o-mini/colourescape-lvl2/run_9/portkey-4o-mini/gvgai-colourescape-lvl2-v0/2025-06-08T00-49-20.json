The exit is located at (row=2, col=16) marked by '%'.\n\n### Available Actions\nGiven the surroundings:\n- **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**: Moves to (row=9, col=4) which is empty.\n- **Left (ACTION_LEFT)**: Moves to (row=9, col=2) which is empty.\n- **Down (ACTION_DOWN)**: Cannot move downward into a wall.\n- **Up (ACTION_UP)**: Moves to (row=8, col=3) which is empty.\n\nSince there are multiple adjacent empty tiles around the avatar, we can choose any of those to expose more area or to navigate around to find an optimal path towards the exit. However, moving right will place us in a more strategic position to potentially navigate towards the box and explore more options for movement.\n\n### Chosen Action\n```Action: 2```\n- I will move right which keeps options open for further moves towards the exit location while maintaining awareness of potential puzzle elements nearby."

Given the objective is to reach the exit and effectively avoid holes, I will go up to (row=8, col=4).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\n**Feedback**: This action will allow us to explore an empty tile above, potentially providing more options to navigate through the level efficiently toward the exit."
