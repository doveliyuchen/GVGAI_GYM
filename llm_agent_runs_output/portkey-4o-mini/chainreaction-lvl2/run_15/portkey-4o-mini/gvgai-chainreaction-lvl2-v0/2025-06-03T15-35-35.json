In this case, there\u2019s a clear focus on managing the `boulders` and ensuring that we complete objectives without incurring penalties.\n\n### Next Move\nGiven that the avatar is situated in the bottom row (row 7), there are no immediate threats from walls or holes in adjacent cells (left or right), and the only hazards nearby are at `(8, 11)`.\n\nHowever, the most strategic action would be to check if we can move towards box at `(3, 12)` or manipulate the boulder at `(7, 4)` as part of a multi-step strategy. Since the avatar is not immediately against a wall, it can move, but first I should reposition to ensure I don't become stuck.\n\nIf I move *down (to (8, 10))* I will be still very much inside the safe region, but there\u2019s a hole at `(8, 11)`, so I should consider moving *up or moving left towards `(7, 9)` to keep multiple options available.*\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the ideal action to maintain flexibility and avoid potential interaction with the hole would be to move left (to `(7, 9)`):\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should allow me to create space for more movements while keeping the holes and barriers in consideration, maintaining alignment with the overall strategy of controlled navigation."
