There are two immediate goals visible (the goal floor '#') located at (14, 1) and (14, 14). \n\nTo begin moving toward one of the goals while avoiding the water hazards, I will first need to understand the potential movements available based on the avatar's orientation and current position.\n\nGiven that water poses a serious risk, and walls can push back, I need to check nearby cells for safe routes. I see that moving to the left (ACTION_LEFT) from the current position will likely keep me safe, as moving from the presumed starting column won't interact with immediate water hazards.\n\nLet's proceed with the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nI expect that moving left will help me establish a safer path and align my avatar closer to a region of fewer hazards, thus supporting the strategy of avoiding immediate risks."

There are also hazards such as water and the catapults present in certain areas. \n\nGiven how the directional actions work, I need to ensure my avatar is safely maneuvering through the available spaces without running into hazards.\n\nSince there has been no mention of the current position of my avatar, I'll assume the avatar is currently not positioned adjacent to a goal, as the goal appears to be at row 14, column 1 and potentially row 14, column 14 as well. \n\nBased on the strategy, I will aim to keep my avatar on the path toward the goal while avoiding hazards. Selecting an action requires me to identify spaces that are accessible.\n\nI'll take the first step toward moving down, assuming I am positioned above row 1, where some paths are clear.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action moves my avatar down and allows me to potentially navigate toward the goal safely. I expect to see progress towards the goal while maintaining awareness of the hazards that may be in play."
