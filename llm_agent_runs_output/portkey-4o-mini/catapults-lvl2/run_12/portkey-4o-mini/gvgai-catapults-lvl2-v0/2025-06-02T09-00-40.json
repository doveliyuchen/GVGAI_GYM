The best course of action is to rotate my avatar to face a different direction to explore options for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should allow my avatar to rotate left, which might open up a pathway for movement in the subsequent turns. I expect this aligns with the strategy of carefully managing my avatar's position and preparing for the next turns."

Currently, to devise the next action, I need to analyze the current position of my avatar which is represented as 'a'. \n\nHowever, since the positions and interactions of the avatar have not been explicitly mentioned in the current state description, I will assume that I'm in a strategic position where movement is necessary to gauge the next steps without getting too close to wall boundaries or water.\n\nTo manage my movements efficiently towards the goal, I will opt to move **down** towards the lower rows where the goal is situated. \n\nThus, I will choose:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should help in approaching the goal and I expect it will get me closer to the target while maintaining the avatar's safety."
