    "content": "Given the current state of the game, it appears that there are several goals (`g`) that we need to reach and eliminate in order to win. The immediate tasks involve navigating the avatar strategically to interact with these goals while avoiding hazards like water (`e`).\n\n### Analysis of the Current Map State:\n- The positions of the goals are at (4, 6), (8, 9), (13, 7), and (14, 14).\n- The avatar is currently positioned at (12, 1) facing south (as indicated by the orientation leading to the possible actions).\n- There are walls (`*`) blocking many direct paths, and water bodies which can eliminate sprites if encountered.\n- The pathway might involve using the moving floors (`$`) and interacting with walls strategically to clear paths towards the goals.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move Towards the Goal at (14, 14)**: This goal is crucial as it is located at the end of the map's row, likely requiring fewer moves to reach compared to the other goals.\n2. **Avoid Water**: The immediate strategy should focus on moving downward to avoid any water crossings that could impact avatar health.\n3. **Plan Actions**: The avatar may need to frequently rotate to face the correct direction to navigate around obstacles and move closer to the goal.\n\n### Action Plan:\nCurrently, the avatar is positioned at (12, 1) facing south. A potential action could be to move south further downwards toward rows where more space appears, and subsequently look for pathways toward the goal at (14, 14).\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is to move down to position (13, 1). It's a step towards evaluating our next moves while maintaining trajectory toward the goal, avoiding immediate hazards."
