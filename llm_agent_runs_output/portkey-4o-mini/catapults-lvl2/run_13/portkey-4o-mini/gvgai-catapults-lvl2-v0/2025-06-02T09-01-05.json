Identify where the avatar currently is and which orientations are possible.\n2. Avoid water hazards and walls while aiming to reach the nearest goal or open pathways.\n3. If the avatar is at risk of not moving or losing a turn, reset my position strategically.\n\nSince I do not have the current position of my avatar, I will strategize based on a common scenario. Let's say I am at a junction, possibly facing north, and I see a goal ('g') directly above me. \n\nThus:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action indicates I will attempt to move 'UP' towards the goal. This should optimize my path and align with my objective of reaching the goals. I expect to progress towards the green door and advance in the game's levels."

    "content": "To determine the optimal move from the current state, let's first analyze the layout of the maze and the current position of the avatar.\n\nThe avatar is represented as 'a' and is currently at (row, col) = (unknown) since its position wasn't specified in the grid information. \n\n### Key Points:\n- The objective is to navigate to the goal ('g' or '#') on the maze while avoiding walls ('*') and water hazards ('e').\n- Based on the information provided, the potential movements the avatar can make are left, right, down, or up.\n- The catapult, moving floors, and other interactive elements in the maze can change the gameplay dynamics.\n\nNow, the task is to select an action that would either advance us toward the goal or reposition the avatar to allow for further movement thereafter. Given that the last action didn't result in a movement towards the goal, I will choose the current state and strategy to plan a new move.\n\n**Considering Target Goal Locations:**\n- The avatar needs to reach the goal locations, notably located at (14, 1) and (14, 14).\n\n### Moving Toward the Goal\nSince no specific avatar position is mentioned, I will focus on reaching one of the known goal positions. \n\n- Assuming the avatar is positioned within an allowable distance to quickly move towards (14, 1) or (14, 14) while checking for available paths:\n  - If moving downwards (action 3) is feasible considering the immediate surroundings\u2014especially for avoiding walls and water\u2014this would be a productive move to get closer to either goal.\n\nNow I will make an action that could lead towards a potential goal.\n\n```Action:ACTION_DOWN```\n\nThis action is expected to help navigate closer to the lower rows of the maze, where goal entries '#', 'g' are located while avoiding wall collisions and hazards."
