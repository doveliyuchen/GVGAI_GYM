The only action available is to rotate.\n\n### Next Action:\nBased on the mechanics of the game, if the avatar's position remains unchanged after attempting a directional action, it may simply have rotated in place without moving. Therefore, I will take the action to rotate to face east (ACTION_RIGHT) and check if movement is possible on the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nFeedback: By facing east, I will be in a better position to find a clear path in the following rounds, allowing for a more strategic maneuver toward the goals."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar's position has not been specified, but the goal positions are marked with '#' at (14, 1) and (14, 14). \n\nTo effectively reach one of the goals, it would be critical to navigate around obstacles while avoiding water and catapults. Since the state indicates multiple water tiles around and a catapult interaction might lead to elimination, I will choose a direction based on possible movement options.\n\nAssuming I need to first orient myself towards a goal, I will decide on the direction. Given the factors, let's prioritize moving upwards which may help in getting closer to the top row where the goal might be more reachable.\n\n### Selecting Action\n``` Action: ACTION_UP ```\nThis action should help reposition my avatar closer to the desired goals, while being cautious of nearby hazards. Following the strategy of maintaing navigational awareness, I expect this action to assist with a clearer path towards the objective."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is positioned at (4, 8), which is on an eastfacing floor represented by '@'. The immediate goal is to reach the goal sprites represented by 'g' on the map, which are located at (4, 6) and (14, 14).\n\n### Observations:\n1. The object immediately to the left (4, 7) is a floor ('.'), which is traversable.\n2. The left movement toward (4, 7) doesn\u2019t lead to a direct goal but enables further movement options.\n3. The current facing direction (east) allows moving left to interact with other potential paths.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nThe strategy emphasizes navigational awareness and the importance of orientation, advocating for the use of available sprites while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBased on the above, an effective move would be to go left (to (4, 7)) to create further movement options in the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis move is intended to explore additional spaces while staying cautious of potential pitfalls in future movements."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is positioned at (row=12, col=1) where a northfacing floor ('@') is located. Reviewing the map, achieving your goal requires careful navigation through the maze while avoiding obstacles like water ('.'), walls ('*'), and potential threats (e.g., southfacing floor '&').\n\nThe immediate objective is to reach the goal at (row=14, col=1), identified as '#'. \n\nGiven your current facing direction (north), to successfully maneuver towards the goal:\n\n1. **First, rotate the avatar towards the goal face, if necessary (down)**\n2. **Then, move towards (row=13, col=1) (down)**\n3. **Finally, proceed down to (row=14, col=1) to reach the goal.**\n\nHowever, before moving down to the goal, be mindful of the potential trap or danger directly below. The map shows a southfacing tile ('&') at (row=5, col=7) and (row=6, col=7), though this should not impede movement as it does not directly threaten your path initially.\n\nYour first action should be to move down towards the goal, since your current facing is already north:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nI expect this action to move you to (row=13, col=1) safely, setting up for the next move towards the goal which is crucial for achieving victory in this level."
