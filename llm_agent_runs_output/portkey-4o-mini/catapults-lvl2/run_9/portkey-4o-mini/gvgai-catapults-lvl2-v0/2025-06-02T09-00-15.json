Since the ground around goals seems accessible based on my map assessment, I will plan to move towards one of those goals.\n\nSince the only available actions are directional movements and the walls seem to block my way, I will select the action to move towards the left (if I am close enough to the goal at (14, 14)) or down towards the goal (if I am in a position to go south without immediate danger).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI will take action RIGHT, expecting to make progress toward the goal at (14, 14), while also confirming that I can safely navigate without running into hazards."

However, I will assume a starting position based on the context of a puzzle-platform game where the first move should likely focus on advancing toward the goal while avoiding immediate dangers.\n\n### Action Decision:\nBased on the game mechanics, I select one of the general moves to engage with the level effectively. Since the most common first positive action would generally be upward (towards the goal),\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action will attempt to move up toward a potential goal position, with the expectation to see if this direction avoids water or walls, ideally bringing me closer to a goal. If the position doesn't change at the next step, I will need to reevaluate my surroundings again."

I will assume it is positioned relative to the nearby elements.\n- Goals are located at `(14, 1)` and `(14, 14)`, indicated by `#` and `g`.\n- Dangerous areas (water) are represented by `e`, and walls by `*`.\n\nGiven the surroundings, I need to ensure:\n1. I avoid stepping into water cells (`e`), which will eliminate my avatar.\n2. I should try to navigate toward at least one of the goals with minimum risks.\n3. I can utilize the catapults (`@`) found on the map to potentially navigate over dangerous spots if needed. There's one at `(4, 8)` and another at `(8, 5)`.\n\nSince the avatar's initial position is ambiguous in this state, I will attempt an exploratory movement to identify my placement and gather more information about my surroundings.\n\nI will take action by moving **down**: \n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nMoving down may reveal vital information or provide a path toward the goals, complying with the strategy of map familiarization. My expectation is to identify the safe path towards the goal while being cautious of water hazards."
