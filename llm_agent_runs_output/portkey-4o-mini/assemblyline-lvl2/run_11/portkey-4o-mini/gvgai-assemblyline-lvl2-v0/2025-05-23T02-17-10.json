The main goal is to transform 'potato' into 'potatofull' and reach the goal at (12, 18).\n   - The avatar is currently able to take actions to move or interact with objects.\n\n### Logical Next Step\nGiven that the avatar's position remains unchanged, I need to determine a meaningful action. There are several 'b' tiles around, which may lead to moving down or left to explore further.\n\n- **Moving Down** to (row=13, col=5) by using `ACTION_DOWN` isn't allowed (it's a wall).\n- **Moving Up** to (row=11, col=5) is not possible since it is a tile with a dot '.' (not an obstacle but empty).\n- **Moving Left** to (row=12, col=4) would provide access to a tile with a potato that can be interacted with.\n- **Moving Right** to (row=12, col=6) also provides access to another b tile, opening potential paths at this juncture.\n\n### Decision\nAs the avatar's position has not changed, moving left (to (12, 4)) appears to be the most beneficial action because it positions the avatar next to a potato ('h'), thus allowing for interaction and pushing towards achieving the goal of transforming the potato.\n\n``` \nAction: 2\n```\n\nThis action is expected to allow access to interact with one of the potatoes and continue the transformation process as part of the gameplay strategy."

Downwards (13, 7) is a wall (w), indicating movement is restricted.\n\n### Next Step:\nSince the current position of the avatar is essential and hasn't changed, I will analyze and act accordingly.

In the natural language map, the avatar ('a') is located at (12, 8) row=12, col=8.\n\n### Current Sprite Layout Near the Avatar:\n- **At (12, 7)** -> Empty (.)\n- **At (12, 9)** -> Portal (P)\n- **At (12, 6)** -> Empty (.)\n- **At (12, 5)** -> Empty (.)\n- **At (12, 4)** -> Empty (.)\n- **At (12, 3)** -> Block (b)\n- **At (12, 2)** -> Block (b)\n\n### Nearby Interactions:\n- Your avatar is adjacent to a portal (12, 9) and empty spots (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 5), which indicate various movement options. \n\n### Objective:\nGiven the fact you need to interact with other sprites to progress, you should consider moving towards the portal as a potential next step. However, the choice of action should also ensure optimally that the avatar is positioned for further transformations or interactions, especially if it doesn't lead to a win state immediately.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince your avatar has not moved recently, a meaningful action would be moving towards the portal directly, which would keep you engaged with the goal sprite in your next turn. You can move to position (12, 9) where the portal is located.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is directly towards the portal and should assist in aligning with your strategy to transform and progress towards the win condition effectively."

This means we can either move left or right to explore new options.\n\nFollowing the suggested overall strategy, I will:\n- Move right to interact with the assembly floor represented by '#', which could present an opportunity in the transformation sequence.\n\nThus, I will execute the action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right towards the assembly, potentially allowing for future interactions or transformations as planned."

The immediate surroundings for potential movement and interaction are:\n- Up (row=11, col=8) - not an action as it's a space '.'\n- Down (row=13, col=8) - also a wall 'w' (blocked)\n- Left (row=12, col=7) - empty space '.'\n- Right (row=12, col=9) - a potato sprite '&'\n\nSince the previous position hasn't changed, I need to take a different action compared to the last state.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **ACTION_USE**: Might activate or manipulate something, but I need to be next to something actionable.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT**: Move left into an empty space.\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT**: Move right into the potato sprite '&'.\n\n### Strategic Objective\nSince the main goal involves transforming the potato sprites, approaching the potato sprite at (row=12, col=9) seems promising. Collecting or interacting with the potato will further the transformation process necessary for reaching the 'goal'.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most meaningful action to take next is to move right to interact with the potato sprite. This aligns with the strategy of utilizing transformations to progress towards the objective.\n\nThus, I will take the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\nFeedback: This action will allow the avatar to interact with the potato sprite, advancing the transformation process necessary to achieve the game's objective."

Our goal is to navigate through the level to transform the potato sprites and eventually reach the goal.\n\nI see that there are multiple collections of sprites in the vicinity. The key transformations of potato sprites are vital to progressing toward the goal, and I need to interact with them strategically.\n\nTo operate efficiently within this layout:\n\n1. I can see the possible interactions around me, especially with the surrounding potatoes and objects.\n2. There is an assembly above my current position (row=11, col=8) that may hold a transformation or useful interaction.\n3. I also see a wall on the left and the right, and on the right of my current position (row=12, col=9), there is a potato (represented by '&') which I can interact with.\n\nI need to determine my next action to progress.
