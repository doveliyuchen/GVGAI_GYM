The avatar is near a lever (i), assembly blocks (@ and #), and various floor obstacles.\n\n2. **Action Requirements**: I need to determine which action will facilitate the achievement of my goal without repeating the last position or making ineffective movements.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- The avatar must utilize available interactive sprites, particularly the lever 'i' at (7, 1) or transform potatos effectively.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nThere aren't any immediate potatos (h) nearby that can be utilized, and the potential for further exploration is limited. Therefore, taking the ACTION_USE with the lever seems strategic, as it may affect the board mechanics and allow better access to the goal or other required sprites.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\n### Feedback and Expectation:\nBy using the lever, I anticipate activating a mechanism that may open a portal or alter the layout, thereby allowing access to critical components necessary for progressing towards the goal while maximizing the transformation of sprites. This action is a foundational step to navigate closer to delivering the 'potatofull' sprite successfully."
