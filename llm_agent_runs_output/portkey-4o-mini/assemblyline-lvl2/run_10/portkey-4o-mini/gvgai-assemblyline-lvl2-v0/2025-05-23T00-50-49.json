Additionally, there's a combination of barriers (`w` for walls) surrounding a readable area, shown with grassy floors (`.`) and other interactive elements.\n\nSince the avatar's position has not changed in the previous state actions (assuming the last action was either non-movement or rotation), an immediate action is required. In this context, the next logical move is to utilize the potato next to the goal.\n\n### Available Actions\n- **Moving Left to Grab the Potato (if needed)**: Since the potato is adjacent left of my current position, I can take that as an optional move to collect and then aim for the goal.\n- **Delivering to Goal**: It looks like I might need to interact with the goal directly to achieve success if I've already collected the potatofull.\n\nGiven that I need to take action, the most efficient would be to directly transform or interact with the goal sprite to proceed towards a victory state.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action anticipates an interaction with the goal, leading to success if the conditions are met.

The avatar should look for parts of the map where potatoes exist (currently indicated by `h`), which are located in other rows.\n2. The available left, right, and up moves may not be possible given wall constraints, but it's important to check if I can rotate towards an available path.\n\n### Available Actions Analysis:\n- **ACTION_LEFT** (2): This will not work due to walls.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT** (3): This will not work due to walls.\n- **ACTION_UP** (5): This also does not yield a move due to walls.\n- **ACTION_DOWN** (4): Similar confinement by walls.\n\nSince movement is impossible in any direction from the current position, the only action to attempt is to rotate, thus I will perform the action to check if anything in the direction of movement changes.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis left attempt will verify if I'm able to adjust my direction and will help me re-evaluate the next significant step towards transformation or discovery of new potentials.

However, strictly speaking, I don't see your avatar's exact position listed in the sprite mapping provided, but let's analyze possible interactions to navigate towards collecting potatoes and achieving our win condition efficiently.\n\nObservations:\n1. The potatoes (`h`) we've identified from the layout are scattered across various rows:\n   - Row 1: Columns 2, 3 (both `q`) \n   - Row 7: Columns 3 (which is `@`)\n   - Row 8: Columns 3 (which is `@`)\n   - Row 9: Columns 3 (which is `@`)\n   - Row 10: Columns 18 (which is `$`)\n2. There are also several levers (`j`) and assembly lines indicated on this map along with walls (`w`) that inhibit movement.\n\nGiven the strategic advice, it's vital to engage with the assembly lines to manipulate or collect potatoes and transform them. The primary goal is to navigate effectively while avoiding walls and utilizing levers when possible.\n\nTo initiate movement, I will take this first step: Move the avatar towards a rye assembly line (`1`, `2`, etc.) or potato (`h`) to start processing or collecting potatoes.\n\nSince I can't see the avatar's position directly in the displayed map, but I assume it's near the assembly line to start collecting or interacting with potatoes nearby.\n\nTherefore:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nMoving left should bring the avatar closer to the potato or assembly mechanics based on our goal to engage with potatoes for transformation, aligning with our strategy.
