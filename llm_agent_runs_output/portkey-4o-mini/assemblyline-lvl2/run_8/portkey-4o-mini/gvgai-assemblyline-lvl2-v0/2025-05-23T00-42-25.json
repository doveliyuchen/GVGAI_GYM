Nearby, there is a goal at (12, 18) marked as 'g', and several possible interactions can happen around this area.\n\nHere's a focused analysis of potential next actions:\n\n1. **Transform Potatoes**: The nearest potato is located at (12, 9), which is marked with '%'. Collecting and transforming this potato is a priority in achieving the win condition.\n2. **Leverage Portal**: The map contains several portals and transformation objects that can likely be used to further interact with the game environment effectively; however, the immediate action is more relevant around the area of the potato.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: I don't see any lasers immediately threatening from my current position.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position will change by moving to (12, 9) where the potato is located, I should act accordingly by moving to collect it.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis will bring me closer to the potato at (12, 9), initiating the process to transform it. I anticipate this action will align well with the overall strategy of maximizing point collection while pushing toward the win condition."
