(empty space)\n- Down: (9, 3) -> @ (another assembly point)\n\nThe strategy suggests focusing on utilizing the assembly points for transformations, as they are key to scoring points. \n\nCurrently, you are at assembly1 (7, 3) to your immediate above, and there\u2019s another assembly point below you at (9, 3). It would be efficient to collect potatoes and use these assembly points to maximize your score.\n\nSince you're currently at (8, 3) and the next logical action is to access the assembly point above (7, 3):\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action (UP) is expected to move you to assembly1, allowing for the next transformation step with the potatoes you may collect."

The avatar needs to navigate away from its current position to grab the potatoes and later transform them. \n2. There are several assembly points: \n   - Assembly point 1 ('@') is at (7, 3), (8, 3), and (9, 3)\n   - Assembly point 2 ('#') is at (6, 9) and (7, 9)\n   - Assembly point 3 ('$') is at (8, 18), (9, 18), and (10, 18)\n3. The primary task is to collect and transform potatoes to get to the \"potatofull\" state.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m surrounded by walls and can\u2019t move. The best action is to use the lever situated above me at (11, 1). I will take the action to manipulate what's accessible to potentially free my movement options and hopefully redirect the path to the assembly points.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action should activate the lever and could potentially change my immediate options for movement, allowing me to strategize my next steps towards achieving the goal."

The floor has various interactive elements but my avatar has not moved since the last state.\n\nTo progress towards the win condition (placing a \"potatofull\" on the goal), I will first move through the level to collect potatoes and transform them at assembly points to score points, keeping an eye on the timer. The operational goal now is to begin movement towards the assembly spot and collect potatoes necessary for transformation.\n\nSince I need to move, I will use the action to go left:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action intends to rotate towards the left, aiding in positioning for the next steps while evaluating the surroundings for potential interactions."

    "content": "Based on the current state, your avatar ('a') is located at (12, 7). There is a goal ('g') at (12, 18) and several important elements nearby including assembly areas and a vortex. \n\n### Current Observations:\n- The immediate surroundings contain various possible actions with the presence of a wall (w) around most edges.\n- To reach the goal, you may need to collect and transform potatoes at the assembly areas (@, #, $) and check the mechanisms like the vortex (*) for teleportation.\n\n### Immediate Strategy:\nThe first step is to interact with the environment effectively to get closer to the goal while potentially collecting a potato or using the assembly points. Since there is a vortex in (5, 15) and the nearest assembly point (for transformation) is at (7, 3) or (5, 9), it would be strategic to head towards assembling and transforming potatoes first.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis means you will move up from your current position (12, 7) to (11, 7). This action positions the avatar to eventually head towards assembly points and navigate to the potential pathway leading up towards the goal area. The expectation is that moving up gives you more options to explore both the assembly areas and find a potato, aligning correctly with the strategy to maximize interactions for high score and progress."
