The immediate area contains a wall to the left (row 13, col 1) and a monster directly below (row 14, col 5). \n\nAccording to the strategy provided:\n- The priority is to avoid the monster directly below and assess the surroundings for possible goodies to collect. \n- The first target should be to collect the nearby goodies while being wary of the monsters.\n\nTo collect goodies, the avatar needs to move to the left or right. However, the left side (row 13, col 1) is blocked by a wall. The right side is a blank floor (row 13, col 3) which won't yield anything. Thus, options must be proactive against the monster.\n\nSince the only forward movement (DOWN to row 14, col 5) leads to a monster and UP (row 12, col 2) is also clear. However, moving UP does not help gather more goodies either. \n\nTo avoid immediate danger, I will move UP to position (12, 2) where there are no threats, and prepare for the next move towards collecting the goodies.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy to maintain distance from the monster while seeking out goodies in the next turn."

There are also various goodies (gems and gold) in rows 1 and 2 that I need to collect.\n\nFollowing the provided strategy to avoid damage and prioritize collecting goodies, I must initially assess my surroundings before deciding on a movement:\n\n1. **Current Goals**:\n   - Collect as many goodies as possible while avoiding the monster at (13, 5).\n   - I note that there are several gems ( '#') located nearby.\n\n2. **Strategic Movement**:\n   - Since I can't approach the monster directly, I should either move left to (13, 1) to collect the gem at that position (if there's no immediate threat) or up to (12, 2), which also appears safe as there are no threats indicated in that direction.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will opt to move **left to position (13, 1)** to collect the gem. This movement allows me to avoid unnecessary risk while getting closer to my goal of gathering resources.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left allows me to collect one of the gems and positions me to potentially collect more goodies in the next move while avoiding direct confrontation with the monster.
