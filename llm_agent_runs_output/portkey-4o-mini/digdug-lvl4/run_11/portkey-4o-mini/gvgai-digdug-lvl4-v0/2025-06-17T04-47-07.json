    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, your avatar is located at (13, 2). To develop an effective strategy, we need to identify nearby collectibles and threats.\n\n- There is a **monster** at (13, 3) directly adjacent to your avatar, which poses a significant risk.\n- The goal is to collect goodies (gems and gold) while avoiding the monster. The closest collectible is a **gold** at (2, 1) below your current position, but it's quite far and will require navigating through multiple rows.\n\nGiven the threat posed by the adjacent monster, the immediate priority is to avoid contact. Thus, rotating away from the monster (to the left) could be an astute initial step to diffuse the immediate threat before considering other movements.\n\nHowever, to avoid being caught by the monster, you need to clear the path to safety while potentially planning a future move to collect goodies. Since you need to ensure movement occurs, we can first rotate, and then possibly shift away from the threat.\n\nI will perform the action of moving left. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is chosen to reposition the avatar away from the immediate threat while avoiding engagement with the monster. I expect to see if I can create enough distance from the monster while planning my next move after reacting to the state change."
