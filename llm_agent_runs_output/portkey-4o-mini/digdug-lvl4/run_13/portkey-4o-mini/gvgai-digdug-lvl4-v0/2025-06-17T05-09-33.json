The avatar is surrounded by open spaces and has collected essential characters such as monsters (marked as '%') nearby.\n2. The ultimate goal is to collect all goodies (gems and gold) while avoiding monsters.\n3. The avatar is currently adjacent to several collectible items, including:\n   - A gem held by a monster at (row 13, col 7).\n   - Other collectibles (gems and gold) located in rows above.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- The immediate threat from the monster at (row 13, col 7) can pose a danger if the avatar moves closer to it.\n- There is an opportunity to move (row 13, col 6) where a gem can be reached safely.\n- After confirming that the avatar stayed in the same position previously, it\u2019s essential to take an action that would advance toward gaining goodies without taking critical damage from the nearby monster.\n\n**Action Decision:**\nTo effectively avoid the monster while trying to gather a goodie, the best move would be:\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action (DOWN) will allow the avatar to move into an open square (row 14, col 5), which is a safe relocation while continuing to analyze the monster's behavior and opportunities for collecting more goodies in the future.

Your avatar is positioned at (row=13, col=5), and there is a monster located at (row=13, col=7). The surrounding tiles contain walls, empty spaces, gold and goodies that need to be collected.\n\n### Analysis of Current State\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: (13, 5)\n2. **Nearby Monsters**: (13, 7) - this monster is directly adjacent to the avatar and presents an immediate threat.\n3. **Collectibles**: Directly southeast from the avatar, there are opportunities to collect goodies (such as gold at (2, 1) to (2, 10) and gems).\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the immediate threat from the monster adjacent to your current position, a defensive move is warranted. Since moving into the monster will result in a loss of the avatar, the best action is to **move left or up to a wall to obstruct the monster's direct path**.\n\n### Available Actions Interpretation\n- Action 0 (NIL) does not alter the state.\n- Action 1 (USE) is not useful right now since the shovel does not apply to the immediate situation.\n- Action 2 (LEFT) moves you to (13, 4), which is safe.\n- Action 3 (RIGHT) moves you to (13, 6), placing you next to the monster.\n- Action 4 (DOWN) is irrelevant as it does not affect the situation immediately.\n- Action 5 (UP) would shift to (12, 5), which is safe, but might not create a better long-term position.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left places the avatar in a safe position, while avoiding immediate confrontation with the monster. It follows the strategy to maintain maximum safety while planning future moves for collecting goodies."
