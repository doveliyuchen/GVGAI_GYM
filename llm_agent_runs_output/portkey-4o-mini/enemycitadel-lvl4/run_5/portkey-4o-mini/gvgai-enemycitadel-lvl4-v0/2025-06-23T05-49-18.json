The main objective is to reach the goal ('$') located at (5, 1).\n\nGiven the layout, here's a quick rundown of the decisions at hand:\n\n- The avatar can move up to (3, 3), where there are passive objects (crates) that can be used to create pathways or block enemies.\n- The next important target is (5, 1), which is our goal.\n\n**Considering the strategy:**\n\n1. We should avoid unnecessary confrontations with the enemy (# at (3, 4)).\n2.

The best immediate move is to interact with the crates or the boulders to create safe space. Since moving left or down would result in confronting enemies, and there are no opportunities to effectively manipulate crates or boulders in that direction, the most strategic action would be to push into a position that allows for further movement options or scoring via interactions with crates.\n\nFor the current action, moving to the left (action 1) would be advisable, as it allows for potential interaction with adjacent crates on the next turn depending on the state after the movement. \n\nThus, the action would be:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action avoids immediate confrontation with enemies and maintains strategic options for the next turn."

Moving left might lead to no significant progress due to the enemy's position directly above.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down should help explore further into the level and potentially allow for interaction with more crates or to reconsider movements to achieve the goal. This aligns with the strategy of exploring available movements while avoiding enemy encounters."

To reach the goal, I should first move down to (row=5, col=3) since it's directly below. After moving there, it may allow further movement down to the goal area while avoiding the enemy.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action moves me down to (row=5, col=3), which is a necessary step to eventually approach the goal without facing the enemy directly.
