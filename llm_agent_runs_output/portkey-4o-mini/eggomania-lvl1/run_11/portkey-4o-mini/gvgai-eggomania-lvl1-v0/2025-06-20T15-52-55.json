The objective will be to collect resources (eggs) while navigating carefully around any threats, such as the fast chickens positioned nearby.\n\nSince the avatar's position is not going to change with the previous action, I will choose to take a meaningful action towards collecting resources.\n\n### Plan:\n- **Goal**: Move towards the egg located at (12, 15).\n- **Action**: The best approach is to move right multiple times until I reach (12, 15).\n\nI will start with one step to the right to see if it causes a rotation or movement. \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action should move my avatar closer to the egg and help me determine the surrounding threats while collecting resources efficiently. I expect this action to align with the strategy by positioning myself closer to the egg without running into dangers like fast chickens."
