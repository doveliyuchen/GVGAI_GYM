Since the avatar's current position may not allow immediate egg collection without encountering threats, strategic movement is key.\n\n### Action Plan\n1. Given the current position, the avatar should move left or right to navigate closer to the eggs.\n2. Move down to avoid the fast chickens, if needed.\n\nSince we have no previously defined movement direction, I will begin by moving right (ACTION_RIGHT), as it will align the avatar closer towards moving down later without encountering any walls.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to enable the avatar to change position and potentially gather resources while avoiding enemies based on the game rules."
