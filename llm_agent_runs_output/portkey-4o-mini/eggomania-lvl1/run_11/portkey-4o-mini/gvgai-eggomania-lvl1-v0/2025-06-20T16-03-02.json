However, the map has fast chickens '@' at row 1, column 19 and row 1, column 20 that need to be avoided or defeated.\n\nGiven that my last action didn't change the position and considering the need to collect resources (explosive eggs) while staying safe from chickens, I should take an action that allows me to move toward the nearest explosive egg.\n\nFrom my current position (12, 1), the nearest explosive eggs are at (12, 16) and (12, 17). Since I can only move left or right, I will move to the right towards the eggs. \n\n### Action Decision:\nMoving right will help me to collect the explosive eggs and maintain a safe distance from the fast chickens.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action will hopefully position me closer to the explosive eggs and away from the threats."

The closest threat is the Fast Chickens, which could pose a danger if they approach the player. The strategy now should focus on catering to resource management while remaining cautious of the nearby threats.\n\nBased on the strategy outlined earlier, the next planned action should be to **move left to (12, 1)** where no immediate threats are present, assessing the situation for prospects to collect resources and potentially avoid enemy Chickens. \n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will help reposition the avatar safely away from the potential danger while scouting for resources to collect."
