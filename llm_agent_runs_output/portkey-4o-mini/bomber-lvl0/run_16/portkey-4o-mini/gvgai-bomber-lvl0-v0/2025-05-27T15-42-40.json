The avatar is surrounded by empty spaces except to the east and west, which have boxes. \n2. The objective will be to reach the goal while avoiding hazards like water.\n\nThe immediate strategy could include moving the avatar towards either direction that allows for further progress. Let's try moving the avatar left or right, considering that moving left to (8, 2) results in an empty space, and boxes are right (8, 4), (8, 14), and (8, 15). \n\n### Making a Move\nI will choose to move the avatar left to position (8, 2) to explore the space further.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should advance the strategy of moving through the level.
