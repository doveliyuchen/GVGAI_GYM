There are boxes at positions (row 1, col 8), (row 4, col 13), (row 8, col 14), (row 8, col 15), and (row 8, col 16), which I can interact with using bombs to clear paths or collect points.\n\nSince the avatar has not moved in the last state, repeating the previous directional action without rotation might be ineffective. Instead, I should explore moving up towards (row 8, col 2) to assess the environment further and potentially encounter bomb sprites or additional interaction points. \n\nThus, my selected action will be:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nI'm moving up to (row 8, col 2) to explore and potentially interact with the bomb sprite, aligning with my strategy of utilizing bombs for clearing paths ahead."
