Moving **LEFT** to (row=8, col=2) - This is valid and clear of obstacles.\n2. Moving **RIGHT** to (row=8, col=4) - This is valid and clear as well.\n3. Moving **UP** to (row=7, col=3) - This is valid, but could potentially lead to water or walls based on the surrounding area.\n4. Moving **DOWN** to (row=9, col=3) - This is valid and also clear.\n5. Using an action (ACTION_USE) on any surrounding sprites does not seem applicable currently, as there are no interaction sprites in immediate reach.\n\n### Decision:\nTo prioritize reaching the goal and ensure we have safe movements, I will choose to move **LEFT** from (8, 3) to (8, 2).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows for movement toward the open pathway without a negative interaction, and aligns with the strategy of navigating safely towards the goal."

The map consists mostly of walls (%) on the first two rows, which significantly limit my movement. The avatar can freely move within a column of spaces available at row 8, but moving upward towards the goal will require careful navigation due to obstacles presented by water (.), boxes (@), and walls (%).\n\nGiven that I have multiple rows of walls just above my current position and considering I can\u2019t directly move left or right into those walls, I would likely attempt to move up in search of an open path towards the goal.\n\nThe available action is moving \"UP\":\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nI expect to move from (8, 3) to (7, 3).
