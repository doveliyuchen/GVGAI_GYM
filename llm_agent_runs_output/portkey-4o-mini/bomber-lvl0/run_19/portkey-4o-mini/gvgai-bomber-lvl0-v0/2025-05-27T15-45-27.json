Moving left or right does not provide a path since both directions are blocked by walls surrounding the box areas. \n\n**Next Steps**: In this situation, I can try to navigate around the boxes to gain access towards the goal. Moving upwards is currently my best option to progress toward my goal while avoiding immediate hazards of water and boxes.\n\nTherefore, I will move **up**:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action will help me progress upwards towards clearer paths leading to the goal while avoiding immediate threats.

There are obstacles (boxes) in the immediate vicinity, and the straight path toward the goal is blocked by both boxes and hazards.\n\n### Potential Action Evaluation\n1. The immediate surrounding vertical and horizontal spaces around our avatar are:\n   - LEFT (8, 2): clean space (not useful for immediate movement)\n   - RIGHT (8, 4): clean space\n   - UP (7, 3): clean space\n   - DOWN (9, 3): clean space\n\nWe should first move the avatar to navigate around the boxes: moving up (to 7, 3) seems to be an optimal choice as it allows for future movement toward the goal area, moving above where the boxes are currently positioned.\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\nI expect this action to be strategically beneficial as it positions us closer to potential pathways leading toward the goal, while avoiding immediate hazards."
