George is currently to the right of the avatar, which is a potential threat because he can initiate a chase.\n2. There is a wall separating the avatar's current position from the rows below, and the avatar's movement can only proceed left, right, up, or down.\n3. To ensure maximum safety, the avatar should avoid interactions with George and try to mitigate the risks posed by the 'annoyed' sprites.\n\nApplying the strategy to avoid George:\n- Moving left to (2, 1) will place the avatar adjacent to a quiet sprite (the one on (1, 1)), increasing safety and potentially providing more options for transformation interactions later.\n\nTherefore, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action corresponds to moving to the right, which is not advisable since it brings the avatar closer to George; instead, I will revise my action to move left:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nMoving left towards (2, 1) will keep the avatar safe and strategically positioned near quiet sprites, aligning with the goal of avoiding George and managing the sprites effectively."

If he approaches, he could turn one of the `quiet` sprites into `annoyed` (`&`).\n- There are multiple walls (`$`) surrounding the gameplay area that restrict movement.\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar include:\n  - **Above (row 1, col 1)**: quiet (`#`)\n  - **Left (row 2, col 0)**: wall (`$`)\n  - **Below (row 3, col 1)**: empty space (`.`)\n  - **Right (row 2, col 2)**: quiet (`#`), `George` is two columns to the right.\n\n### Possible Actions\nGiven the above considerations, I need to choose an action that:\n1. Maintains the safety of the avatar by avoiding proximity to `George`.\n2. Optimally interacts with the `quiet` sprites to enhance scoring potential.\n\nConsidering the goals and the threats posed by `George`, the best action is:\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action attempts to move the avatar **up** (to row 1, column 1), which is currently occupied by a `quiet` sprite. This will not only help maintain the number of `quiet` sprites (increasing score) but also create a buffer between the avatar and `George`.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nBy executing this action, I anticipate that my position will change to contain a `quiet` sprite, thereby maximizing scoring potential while distancing myself from `George`. This aligns with the provided strategy to manage the NPC states effectively while ensuring safety from threats."
