Remaining mindful to avoid backtracking unnecessarily is also essential.\n3. **Plan for Boss Engagement**: I will need to find a route that eventually leads to the vicinity of the boss while managing resources.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will choose to move **left** to position `(14, 4)`.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis means I am opting to navigate through an open cell that may lead me toward additional paths for resource gathering or strategic positioning against enemies/bosses.

The objective involves defeating the boss. However, engaging the boss directly is not possible currently due to the need for resource collection and managing thugs.\n2. The avatar needs to navigate towards areas that might lead to resource collection, such as moving closer to the depot (# at (8, 1)) or interacting more closely with the thugs.\n\n### Next Action\nSince the avatar is in a relatively free space with options, the **best move** that does not involve going back is to take a step UP to position (9, 8). This keeps options open to engage further in the next turn, possibly maneuvering towards the depot for resources or preparing for the boss engagement.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this move will geographically position the avatar closer to resources or strategic enemy engagements while evading any immediate threats."
