There's no immediate threat from thugs around this position.\n\nSince there are no resources in immediate proximity, gaining mobility while keeping an eye on future paths is essential.

Also, moving to the right keeps you in a more favorable location in future moves as it opens more pathways that do not run into walls and allows for potential key collection.\n\n### Next Action\n``` Action:2 ```\nI am moving to the right (14, 5) to position myself for better options to interact with resources or enemies in the subsequent turns. I expect this action to improve my position without immediate conflict with enemies."
