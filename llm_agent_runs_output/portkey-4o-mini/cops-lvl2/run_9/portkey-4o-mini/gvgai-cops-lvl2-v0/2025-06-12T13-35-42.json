The primary focus should be to move towards the nearest resources or unlock anything useful like jail doors (`&`) or the depot (`#`).\n\nConsidering these factors, I will take action to move upwards where more open terrain is available, which can provide pathways to reach the thugs or access the depot and jail.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up will allow me to explore potential resources nearby and ensure that my position changes from the last state to keep progressing towards my objectives effectively."

At this stage, I should continue exploring the map to find more resources, particularly keys, and avoid any immediate threats.\n\nGiven the current positioning, I will choose to move right to (14, 7).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nMoving right is the best action to ensure progress while exploring for additional resources.

Below is an analysis of your current situation and potential next actions:\n\n### Current Observations:\n- Surrounding your avatar at (14, 8):\n  - Up (13, 8): 'b' (wall)\n  - Down (15, 8): 'b' (wall)\n  - Left (14, 7): '.' (floor)\n  - Right (14, 9): '.' (floor)\n\nRight now, the only valid movements for your avatar would be to the left (to (14, 7)) or to the right (to (14, 9)). Since moving into a wall is not possible, you need to choose between two floor tiles.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n1. **Resource Collection**: Since there are no nearby enemies, there is currently no strategic need to change your immediate position to engage.\n2. **Movement Choice**: Opting to move left or right doesn\u2019t impact enemy encounters at this moment, but moving right allows you to stay closer to the resources available in the next rows.\n\n### Next Action Decision:\nConsidering the strategic approach to stay on accessible tiles while also positioning yourself optimally for the next moves, I will move **right** to (14, 9).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should advance toward more accessible floor tiles, which may lead to opportunities for resource gathering or better positioning for future encounters."

To maximize resource collection, moving to the right (col=7) will allow your avatar to progress through the map and gather more points from the tokens as they are in the next columns.\n2. The strategy also suggests that direct movement without rotation is preferred, ensuring clear and direct paths to resources.\n\n### Final Action:\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar right towards the tokens, setting up for future moves to collect resources and ultimately confront the boss."

The immediate strategy is to navigate towards useful resources and avoid getting cornered by thugs or running out of time.\n\n1. The first observation is that you currently possess an avatar with the ability to interact with certain objects. The goal is to effectively collect resources, especially keys, and avoid any negative encounters with thugs.\n2. The closest key element is the jail, located at (8, 3) and (8, 4), which can be a potential target to unlock for additional resources but requires careful navigation.\n3. There are viable paths leading towards depot at (8, 1) which can further assist in resource management.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best move would be to navigate downwards to plan for upcoming actions while remaining mindful of the time limit.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down into row 15, ensuring progress towards the depot area and keeping the strategy in line with effective resource collection.
