My immediate surroundings consist mainly of empty spaces (.) with some walls (b) and a few relevant features like depots and thugs in other rows. Specifically, there are two depots I can see on row 8 at (8, 1) and (3, 7) down below, which could be crucial for resource collection.\n\nTo determine my next move, I should first look to move strategically towards a key resource or objective without engaging with any enemies unnecessarily. Since the avatar's position hasn't changed from before, and I need to evaluate the area, I will take an action to the left direction from my current position (11, 6) to (11, 5) to see if that gives me new insight on what is available to interact with. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to check for other tactical options while moving closer to the depots or possible enemies in the vicinity. I will expect that the movement confirms I can either push towards my resource goals or prepare for potential engagements."
