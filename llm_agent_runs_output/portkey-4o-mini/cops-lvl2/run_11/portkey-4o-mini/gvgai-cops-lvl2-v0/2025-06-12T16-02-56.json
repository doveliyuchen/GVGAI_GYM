The player should:\n1. **Collect resources** like keys, which may be necessary to access new areas.\n2. **Engage strategically with the environment**, ensuring every move towards objectives is purposeful.\n\n### Possible Actions\nGiven that the current position does not change after a static analysis, I should take an action. Based on the layout:\n- There\u2019s a jail (8, 3) upward and a depot (8, 1) to the left, both of which may potentially have resources or threats.\n\nSince there is a chance to explore for keys and resources nearby, I will move **up** towards (13, 6), which is a more direct approach toward gathering possible power-ups or boss confrontations.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action involves moving up to access new paths and opportunities to gather resources and explore the jail area, aligning with the overall strategy of efficient resource collection."

The key focus now should be on reaching the boss or exploring areas for potential keys or resources.\n\n### Analyzing the Moves:\n- The only available actions that can be taken considering your current position (14, 6) are to move up (to 13, 6) which is a wall, so that is an invalid move.\n- Moving down (to 15,6) is another wall.\n- Moving left (to 14,5) is also a wall.\n- Moving right (to 14,7) is still a wall.\n\n### Result:\nNone of the directional actions allow movement.
