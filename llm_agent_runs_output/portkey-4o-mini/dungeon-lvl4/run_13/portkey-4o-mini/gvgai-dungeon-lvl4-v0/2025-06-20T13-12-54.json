Keys are essential for unlocking the exit.\n- **Exit (`$`)**: The exit is located at (1, 20). \n\n### Hazards to Consider\n- **Boulders (`@`, `#`)**: Located below the avatar's potential path could obstruct movement.\n- **Fire (`%`) and traps (`t`)**: These are dangerous and must be avoided to ensure the avatar's health remains intact.\n  \n### Current Priorities\n1. **Collect the key** if not yet acquired.\n2. **Collect nearby gold** as per the strategy of resource management.\n3. **Avoid hazards** (boulders, fire, etc.) while navigating towards the exit.\n\nNow let's determine the action based on the position of the avatar. If the avatar is not rotated towards a specific direction based on previous actions, I will select an action that ensures progress while keeping in mind potential hazards and the presence of the key.\n\nIf the last action did not cause a movement, I should either rotate the avatar again or move towards an area that I can collect resources or the key.\n\nSince there's no specific position provided for the avatar, I'm going to assume it's standing still with a need to navigate towards the key at (7, 7).\n\n### Decision\nConsidering that the key is a vital resource necessary for exiting, I will decide to move downwards, as it appears to lead towards zones with collectible resources.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis action moves the avatar downwards towards possible opportunities to collect items or approach the key more closely, aligning with the strategy focused on resource collection while also avoiding hazards."

Move toward the positions with the gold items to increase my score.\n2. If nearby, attempt to collect the key before heading towards the exit.\n\nSince I need to take a meaningful action and I do not currently see where my avatar is, I'll make the assumption I am stationary, and since I have no position, I will start by attempting to move left (assuming a movement in that direction).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action will hopefully get me closer to a valuable item or necessary resource, while also adhering to the strategy of navigating toward those goals."

The current map shows multiple characters which represent different entities, but the avatar is presumed to be present in the context provided.\n\n### Game Objective:\nOur goal is to collect items (gold and keys) while navigating towards the exit, denoted by `$`. Avoid hazards such as fire, traps, and boulders to maintain health.\n\n### Map Observation:\nThe map reveals that there are several gold `&` items and keys `*` scattered in the vicinity, as well as the exit `$` at (1, 20). \n\n### Current Hazards:\n1. Positions with hazards such as `#` (boulders), `%` (fire), and gaps (`k` can be considered a wall).\n2. The exit is closely placed near health-risk hazards characterized by its surroundings.\n\n### Priority Actions:\n1. **Collect Key and Gold**: Sitting tight on priority of key and gold.\n2. **Move Towards Exit**: Plan moves to get to `(1, 20)` smartly avoiding traps and boulders.\n3. **Stay Healthy**: Ensure actions don't lead into direct contact with fire or traps.\n\n### Assumed Avatar Position:\nWe need to establish where the avatar currently is, which isn\u2019t explicitly stated, thus we will assume the avatar is near the bottom half of the map since it is notably populated with hazards and treasures.\n\n### Action Determination:\nLet's assume the avatar is maximally moving towards the exit while avoiding hazards effectively in the next steps of action taken. Given the available actions and understanding the rotations.\n\n#### Choosing Action:\n- **If close to exit**: Move downwards where safe.\n- **If collecting gold or key**: Move towards positions with `&` or `*`.\n\nSince the map detail shows structured walls and items, I will be cautious about how to proceed. Also, based on the current surroundings and proximity to key positions:\n\nTo make progress, I propose to move:\n``` \nAction: 3  # Moving Down\n```\n\n### Feedback:\nBy making this move downward, we aim to navigate closer to collecting gold or improving position towards the exit while keeping health intact, aligning with the overall strategy articulated."

It's vital to ensure health is preserved while navigating towards the key and eventually to the exit.\n4. **Resources:** The surrounding layout suggests that multiple keys (marked as `k`) are present; it's essential to consolidate more gold (`&`) to increase the score and keep health points intact away from fire hazards (`%`).\n\n### Strategy to Proceed:\n- **Collection First:** As per the strategy, the priority is to collect the `key` first while avoiding traps and hazards.\n- **Route to Key:** Move down to collect gold and then navigate towards the key.\n  \n### Proposed Action:\nSince the avatar's position is currently stuck in that location, I will analyze the best first move.

We can see multiple keys are scattered throughout, particularly near the lower rows.\n2. **Collectibles**: There are also several gold pieces we can collect which are present in several rows that may enhance our score.\n3. **Hazards**: We need to be aware of fire ('%'), ground traps ('t'), and boulders ('#' and '@'), which can reduce health.\n\nSince there is no current specified avatar position, we should assume that our first action is to rotate toward the desired direction based on the strategy outlined:\n\n- **Strategy**: The focus should be on navigating towards the key at (13, 7) and avoiding hazards. If we assume an initial orientation and want to start exploring horizontally, moving to the right may be a feasible action.\n\n### Action Decision\n- We'll start by moving **Right** (to potentially collect gold or move toward the key).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of collecting resources while keeping cautious of nearby hazards.

The presence of multiple keys implies it might be necessary to gather a few for various locks.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.

Ensuring to collect these resources while avoiding hazards is a priority.\n\n3. **Hazards in the Environment**: Ensuring we navigate carefully around potential traps (fire, boulders), especially since the surrounding area contains walls and a \u2018ground trap\u2019 at (7,2) location.\n\n## Strategy\nFocusing on collecting gold and maintaining health while avoiding traps and fire hazards is critical. Since the avatar's position (which is not indicated in the map but follows it) should be actively considered, moving towards a valid resource (such as '&' for gold) should be a priority if movement is possible.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the avatar should either be in a row with collectable gold or about to move down (from a position like row 7 to find gold or reach the exit) that means we should move \"up\" or in another direction where progress can still be efficient. Let's move the avatar down to row 8 to be in a better position for the resources below while avoiding hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will help position the avatar to collect nearby gold and keep moving towards objectives.
