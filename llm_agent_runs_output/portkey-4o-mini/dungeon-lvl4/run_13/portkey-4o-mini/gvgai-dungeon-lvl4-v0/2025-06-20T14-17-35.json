Important locks (m) that may hinder progress are also present.\n3. **Immediate Actions:** Considering resource priority, collecting gold (g) and the key (*) would be beneficial for progressing through the game.\n\nFrom the current state explained:\n- The avatar can maneuver at least to the right where there are gold and potentially a key nearby. The passage above may be a better option for maneuvering towards necessary resources instead of going into areas with potential traps later.\n\n### Current Action Decision\n- The plan is to proceed to the right, moving towards the valuable resources, specifically focusing on reaching the nearest gold at (1, 1) and (1, 15) in the next moves. \n\nThus, the chosen action is: \n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is anticipated to yield progress by facilitating resource acquisition, which is in agreement with the suggested strategy of resource collection."

The avatar (position is unspecified, but must assume it's within the bounds of the map), needs to navigate through resources (gold, keys) and avoid obstacles (traps, fire). The primary goal is to collect necessary items while ensuring enough health points remain to overcome hazards.\n\n1. **Resources:** There are **keys (k)** scattered throughout the map, as well as **gold (g)**, which provides points. Importantly, I'm seeing several keys at various positions and several gold pieces along the rows where the avatar may likely be.\n\n2. **Obstacles:** The closest signs of hazards include a boulder (2,1) and a potential fire trap (10,12). Avoidance of these will be pivotal if they're on the route the avatar must take to reach the exit.\n\nGiven all this, I need to ensure I am moving to collect resources and navigate to the exit efficiently.\n\n### Analyzing the Avatar's Motion\nThe immediate actions are informed by the need to navigate toward the exit. Depending if the avatar's position is determined, I'll choose an appropriate movement that aligns with these objectives. \n\nIf my current position is to the left or right of the exit, my first action can move further toward it while collecting resources along the way.\n\n### Expected Movement Action\nAssuming for now the avatar is somewhere in the left region (let\u2019s say close to current position (1,1) or similar), I would go:\n\n```Action: 2``` \n\nMoving right should help collect gold and navigate toward the exit. If the avatar's rotation leads to no movement, I'd validate the map and apply the action again if necessary since the map is heavily filled with keys and gold that is beneficial to collect.

It would be strategic to move toward the area to find a key or collect resources that will allow further progress.\n2. The adjacent cells (to the right (row=0, col=1), down (row=1, col=0), etc.) mostly consist of other locks or non-resource entities.\n\n### Strategic Action\nMoving **right** (column increment) will let us explore more locks and gold resources.

This will boost my strategic options for further unlocking locked paths in the game.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to collect the key will be beneficial for future navigation and puzzle-solving, aligning with the strategy of resource collection and unlocking progress."

The exit appears to be in the bottom row (`$` at `row=1, col=20`). Meanwhile, surrounding areas feature various items likely to yield keys or gold. I'll prioritize my action around locating the immediate item.\n\nFollowing the strategic guidance:\n- I\u2019ll navigate towards collecting any obvious surrounding resources based on my location and the state features.\n\n### Proposed Action\nSince there is visible gold (`&`) at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 15)` nearby, I may move toward those or find a key nearby at several `k` positions. I will choose to move **RIGHT** to `(1, 1)` where I can grab the gold.\n\nThus, I choose the corresponding action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nI expect this aligns with my strategic goals of prioritizing resource collection. Should this movement yield an effective result, I will continue to navigate strategically based on further resources and available traps to ensure effective advancement toward the exit."

However, it's important to note that the avatar's position is not explicitly mentioned in the current state.\n\nTo make sense of the map, we can hypothesize that the current position of the avatar might be among available resources or paths stated (like gold, keys). Since the game has multiple 'k' and other resources, we can assume perhaps a central position near row 7 or 8, given that they are filled with elements like keys, locks, and the exit.\n\nConsidering that the win condition is reaching the exit (denoted by '$'), we need to prioritize actions that lead in that direction while managing health and avoiding traps.\n\n### Current Layout Analysis\n- The exit is located at (1, 20).\n- Keys are abundant and can be found in rows with positions adjacent to potential routes.\n\nSince the game mechanics include obstacles (lasercannons, boulders, traps), it would be wise to safely maneuver toward the exit while collecting necessary keys (if not already collected).\n\n### Action Decision\nConsidering previous state reasoning, I\u2019ll proceed with the action that seems to advance position toward the exit, assuming a navigable path toward step (1, 20) structure-wise in my control set.\n\n1. **Preferred Move:** Navigate towards the exit either to the right or down as they are accessible.\n2.

Collecting gold is a priority while heading towards the exit, which is on the same row (row=1, col=20).\n\nGiven that the avatar is still in the same position after analyzing the state, the immediate action would be to move towards the right, aiming to collect gold which is present at (row=1, col=1) and (row=1, col=2), then proceeding towards gathering the key.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action sets the avatar to move right toward the gold and make progress towards completing the level by maximizing score collection.
