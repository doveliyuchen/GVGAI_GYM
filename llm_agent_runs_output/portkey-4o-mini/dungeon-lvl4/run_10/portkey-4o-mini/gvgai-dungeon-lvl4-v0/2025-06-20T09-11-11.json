Based on the map, the avatar is likely starting at a bordered point filled with walls \u2018k\u2019, meaning it will have limited options for initial movements wherever it actually is. The most straightforward action to either move towards potential gold resources or to the key.\n\nSince I have no defined avatar position from where I previously was, I can't act without verifying my position.\n\n### Action Determination:\nAssuming the avatar starts at a central position surrounded by walls, the intention will be to navigate towards discovering movement possibilities rather than getting impeded by hazards at the edges of the map first.\n\n1. Start with moving **Right** to explore if there's an opening that allows further movement toward any resource or the exit.\n\nChoosing **Right** as my initial action gives me the best chance to assess potential movement options.\n\nNow, I will execute the action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action is expected to help in exploring the map further, possibly leading closer to key or gold while I define more strategic actions thereafter."

The detailed mappings of the levels provide hazardous obstacles (fireholes, boulders), as well as resources (gold, keys, and potentially the exit).\n\n### Understanding Objectives\n1. **Objective**: Collect resources (gold and the key) to reach the 'exit' sprite which is marked as '$'.\n2. Paths to consider:\n   - The position of the exit at (1,20) provides a route through the row.\n   - The area around has many collectibles including keys and gold, offering a potential to gather resources before making the final push towards the exit.\n\n### Strategy Derived\nThe essential action will be to determine a suitable and safe path towards the exit while considering hazards. The previous state checks must determine if an action was taken, and since the sprite description indicates many solid elements prevalent on the mapped area, movement away from immediate traps or hazards is necessary.\n\n### Immediate Action\nFor maximizing the chances of making a move while avoiding threats, I will select the `ACTION_LEFT` as an exploratory option towards identifying interactions nearby resources or finding potential paths to safety.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action is expected to reposition the avatar effectively for further exploration without losing health, in line with the game strategy.

The expectation is to either collect gold or position the avatar closer to more resources without hitting any traps or hazards."

The exit is directly up (to (18, 20)), but there are obstacles. Therefore, exploring alternative routes by considering potential hazards and ensuring our health remains intact is essential.\n\nA valid action to try would be to move **UP**, as there\u2019s no immediate threat above where our current location is, and there remains a path towards the exit.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up seems to be a strategic choice considering the layout and desire to reach the exit, I expect to either find a clearer path or continue moving towards my target without losing health."
