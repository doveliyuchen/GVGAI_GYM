We need to locate the avatar's position based on the surroundings of obstacles, accessible items, and exit points.\n\nFrom a detailed examination of the map:\n- **Exit (represented by '%')**: located at row 1, column 20.\n- **Gold (represented by '*')**: there are multiple gold items scattered across the map, notably:\n  - row 1, columns 1 and 2\n  - row 15, column 1\n  - row 11, column 1\n  - row 8, columns 7 and 19\n- **Key (represented by 'b')**: located at row 13, column 7.\n- **Health threats**: Represented by fire holes ('&'), traps ('t'), and walls ('l') are commonplace, particularly around the central rows.\n  \n### Analysis of Available Moves:\nSince the avatar's position is missing, we will presume it is situated somewhere it can make a meaningful action towards acquiring gold or the key and then reaching the exit.\n\n### Strategy Recommendations:\n1. **Collect Gold First**: Since collecting gold will maximize the score, it would be beneficial to focus on any nearby gold first depending on the avatar's initial position.\n2. **Obtain the Key**: If the avatar is positioned near the key, prioritize moving towards it.\n3. **Reach the Exit**: Once sufficient resources are collected or upon getting the key, make a pathway towards the exit station.\n\nGiven that the avatar position is not updated yet (as confirmed in the logs), we understand it may need to be adjusted.

The map has walls that limit movement.\n- The primary objectives include collecting as much gold as possible, obtaining the key, and reaching the exit (%).\n- The player's position is marked as 'a'; however, it is not explicitly indicated in the current state output where the avatar is located.\n\n### Map Overview\nBased on the provided map, we need to locate the avatar's current position and nearby items:\n1. We observe that there are several gold items ('*'), a key ('b'), and the exit ('%') located on various parts of the map.\n2.

Since the player's previous action isn't specified to have moved, and keeping in mind that the player's health is vital, the player might need to reposition effectively to collect items or approach the exit.\n2. After analyzing the surrounding tiles, if the avatar hasn't yet rotated, we should take an action that moves toward the nearest goal (e.g., the key at (13, 7) or the exit at (1, 20)) or collects gold while remaining safe from hazards.\n\nGiven the state:\n- The avatar's immediate moves must avoid hazards.\n- The next logical move would be to go right (assuming the player can safely move toward the nearest item or ideally into untapped spaces like walls).\n\nThus, the chosen move will be:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, allowing the player closer access to potentially collect items or retreat into safety if needed."

If the avatar is adjacent to the gold at (1, 1), it should move down or right to collect it.\n2. If the avatar is near the key at (13, 7), it should navigate towards it.\n\n**Plan of Action:**\n1. **Evaluate Possible Moves from Avatar Position:** Assuming the avatar can currently move, I will choose a direction based on proximity to gold or key.\n2. **Prioritize safe movement:** Avoiding fire hazards or obstacles.\n\nGiven that I do not see the current position of the avatar in the information provided, I will assume it is somewhere from which there\u2019s clear access either to gold or towards the key.\n\n### Choosing an Action\nSupposing the avatar is either around the rows where the gold is located (specifically around row 11 or row 1), I will assertively choose to take an action to collect gold first:\n\nIf the avatar is near row 1, column 1:\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n(Down to collect the gold at (1,1))\n```\nI anticipate moving downwards will allow for gold collection at (1,1) while aligning well with the strategy of prioritizing resource collection.\n```\n\nIf the avatar is already at row 1 and able to collect gold at another location:\n``` Action: 2 ```\n(Right to collect another gold piece)\n```\nThis action would ensure I maintain momentum in collecting gold efficiently, anticipating a potential score increase.\n```\n\nIf there are no other nearby gold resources or if navigating towards key:\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n(Down towards (13, 7) location for key)\n```\nThis should yield the key acquisition towards reaching the exit if safely navigated.\n\n### Conclusion\nClarity on the avatar's specific position would help dictate more precise movements. Moving towards the gold or the key is strongly advantageous based on the game strategies outlined. Ultimately, we will proceed with the action that reinforces the need to collect resources and navigate safely through traps and hazards."
