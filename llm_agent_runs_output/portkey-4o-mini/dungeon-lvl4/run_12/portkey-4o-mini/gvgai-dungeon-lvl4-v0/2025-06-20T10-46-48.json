The strategy suggests exploring while managing health by avoiding environmental dangers.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Collecting gold appears to be useful for scoring points.\n- The only actionable items currently in your vicinity are gold items, while moving towards the exit (1, 20) requires navigating through the row, avoiding potential hazards ahead.\n- The position (1, 0) has gold and would be a potential next step.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving left (to the position (1, 0)) is aligned with the strategy of resource collection, as you can collect gold without encountering immediate hazards.

Focus on collecting gold while avoiding hazards.\n2. If I come across the key, I should prioritize obtaining it, as it may be needed to unlock doors.\n3. I need to ensure my health remains above 0.\n\n### Next Action\nSince the position of the avatar has not changed, I will take action to navigate towards obtaining gold while avoiding hazards. My closest safe move would be to go **up** toward the gold at (7, 9).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nI expect this action to bring me closer to the available gold and keep me out of danger."

I will first try to move upwards.\n\nSince I haven't moved yet and need to search for a direction, I will initiate movement towards the exit (upwards) to further my progress.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up allows me to approach the exit, and I will expect to either collect more resources or get closer to the exit on my next turn."

The avatar's position cannot be determined without knowing the last known position. \n\nHowever, by looking at the map layout, I can see various items scattered around, and I will focus on significant items in proximity to the avatar, like the key 'k' located at (7, 12), gold '*' located at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 15), (4, 11), (6, 8), (6, 20), and the exit '$' located at (1, 20).\n\nSince the exit is near at (1, 20), and I want to maximize my score while heading towards the exit efficiently, the initial strategy will be to ensure I don't encounter any hazards leading to health loss, while moving toward the exit. \n\nAssuming a reasonable starting position for the avatar is prior to the last known actions, I will choose to move right toward the exit at (1, 20) if it is clear, as that directly aligns with my goal to reach the exit.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to move me closer to the exit, enhancing my scoring potential while minimizing unnecessary risks from hazards along the way."
