However, the specific position of the avatar is not detailed in your state representation.\n\nSince the environment is heavily populated with locked doors (indicating the need for keys), fire hazards, and gold (which increases score), a strategic movement must focus on ensuring we do not get caught in traps or hazards while also considering routes that allow us to gather gold and get closer to the exit.\n\n### Strategic Action\nGiven these considerations, a meaningful action can begin by analyzing the proximity to a safe path and whether any rotations are needed first. However, as the position of the avatar is unspecified, I will default to the most logical direction:\n\n1. **Collect Gold**: The first line shows several keys, but the second row does have collectable gold. Therefore, moving down from the potential row of keys to row 1 would be the first step.\n2. **Beware of Hazards**: Ensure the movement does not lead the avatar into fire or loss of health from hazards.\n\nSince a position move isn't clearly indicated, I\u2019ll position myself:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis would mean I expect to move down toward row 1 and ideally collect some gold while ensuring my path is clear of hazards. My feedback on this action is that it aligns with the strategy of exploring and collecting resources first."

If we are currently positioned near a gold floor:\n   - Always prioritize collecting gold as they increase our score.\n2. Navigate towards the exit in a way that avoids hazards and considers the need for accessing locked doors.\n\n**Current Positioning Action:**\nBased on my avatar's position assumed from similar scenarios within the layout, I will execute the first action towards the right since there are gold footprints appearing in that general area and we should maintain our goal of collecting resources while heading towards the exit.\n\nLet's proceed with the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThe expectation is to collect gold if it's present to the right or reposition closer to advantageous resources and ultimately towards the exit."

Since an explicit position for the avatar isn't provided in the state, I will infer that the avatar is at one of the more accessible locations based on proximity to gather gold and the key. \n\n2. **Entities Nearby:** There are several key (k), gold (&), and lock (g) tiles scattered throughout the surrounding area, particularly in the row with a number of locks indicating there are areas blocked, and the exit ($) is located at (1,20), suggesting a need to navigate successfully through locks towards the exit.\n\n3. **Strategy Application:** The strategy emphasizes careful planning regarding movement and resource collection.\n\n### Proposed Action\nFocusing on resource collection, particularly where there are gold tiles, would be essential for maximizing score. Since the exit is relatively nearby given the layout, heading towards prompt interactions with these tiles would facilitate progress.\n\nThus, I will choose an action that moves in a forward direction toward the last area explored.\n\nLet's utilize the downward movement to advance towards the empty area where the exit is located.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis will allow me to explore further while being mindful of positions and hazards as mentioned in my strategy. I expect to get closer to locked doors or maybe even gather some of the gold as I move."

The first direction should favor movement towards collected items while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Recommended Action\nLet's choose an action. I'll start by moving right (the most straightforward option available) to explore the adjacent tiles and assess the opportunities for collecting gold or moving towards the exit.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n- **Feedback:** Moving right will either lead to the collection of gold or open up more options, aligning with our strategy of prioritizing resource collection.

The vast majority of the cells in the grid, especially in the upper rows, consist of 'k', which are likely walls or locked locations, making free movement challenging until a key is obtained.\n   \n2. **Resources Available:**\n   - **Gold:** There are multiple gold ('&') resources on the map, particularly present in rows 1, 6, 8, 9, and others. Collecting these will increase the score.\n   - **Keys:** There are numerous locations marked with 'k', indicating potential places where the keys might be or where they may need to be used. The game reality suggests that the avatar starts collecting keys to unlock various doors, which adds strategic depth.\n   - **Exit:** The exit is marked with '$' located at (1,20), which is directly accessible if the avatar can reach that location without navigating through fireholes ('%') or ground traps ('t').\n\n3. **Hazards:** There are fireholes and boulder holes scattered throughout the map. Direct interaction with these can lead to losing health points. Therefore, movement strategies need to include careful navigation around these hazards to maintain health.\n\n### Current Plan:\nGiven that the avatar is positioned without a clearly specified starting point on the map (it seems that the avatar's symbol might have been omitted), I need to surmise a possible position, typically beginning from one of the more accessible areas.\n\n**Strategic Priorities:**\n- Try to reach a position where the avatar can immediately collect gold or the key while steering clear of hazards.\n- As the avatar's location is crucial, I would perform a directional move either towards a gold piece or a key.\n- Considering that the map seems to have a lot of openings without clear paths through locked doors, I'd aim to first collect gold. \n\n### Decision:\nSince we don't have a specified starting point for the avatar, based on the available positions, the most immediate action can be moving towards a location that likely leads to resource collection or the exit directly.\n\nI will choose the action to move **right**, which should allow exploration towards a gold piece.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of resource collection and exploration, aiming to position the avatar favorably for future moves, especially towards the exit or valuable items."

The avatar can explore towards available resources (such as gold or the key) while also navigating safely around hazards (like fire and traps).\n2. The immediate goal is to collect the keys and gold scattered across the map, all while ensuring movements avoid hazards that can lead to a loss of health.\n\nBased on the map, if the avatar was at position (7, 5) previously, moving down appears to be a safe choice since it opens avenues toward collecting gold and potentially keys while avoiding fire traps.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action involves moving DOWN, with the expectation of either collecting more resources or finding a safe path towards the exit while adhering to the planned strategy."

Hence, I cannot see the exact position of the avatar. If the avatar must be moved, I can ensure to navigate around based on the available information.\n\n- The exit is located at row 1, column 20 (represented as '$').\n- There are various resources, including keys ('*'), much gold ('&'), and locked doors ('g') in the surrounding rows.\n\n### Decision-Making\nSince I can't see the current avatar's position, I must execute a cautious action based on the likely need to collectively acquire more resources or avoid danger. \n\n- For example, moving left (ACTION_LEFT) or right (ACTION_RIGHT) seems to be impractical without knowing the avatar's position explicitly.\n\nThus, to analyze more effectively without risking the avatar's health, I can begin with a simple but meaningful action to gather information while minimizing risks:\n\n### Chosen Action\nLet's take one of the simplest non-movement actions to see if it's rotation only or if it gives me a clearer view on where I'm positioned:\n``` Action: ACTION_NIL ```\nThis will not change the state, but it's crucial to see whether I can ascertain more about the pixel I control.\n\n#### Feedback\nBy taking this action, I can determine if any information is revealed about the avatar's status or position relative to surrounding collectibles or hazards, all while adhering to my strategy of avoiding threats and ensuring resource collection."
