I must also pay attention to important items like the key (`e`) which is located at (13,7).\n3. **Strategy Assessment**: According to the provided strategies:\n   - Focus on avoiding hazards while navigating towards the exit.\n   - Gathering resources like gold is important, but health management is a priority.\n   - The lock (`l`) needs to be opened with the key if the route requires it.\n\nSince my position does not change and I can move in the game by choosing actions accordingly, I will choose an action based on the previously suggested strategies.\n\nLet's assume the avatar is positioned nearby to proceed towards the exit while considering the nearby gold resources. If I decide to take the action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis would move the avatar left, assuming it was positioned in such a way that this would get me closer to either gold or maneuverable space.\n\nAfter this action, I will reassess the map if my position changes and decide on my next move based on available options.

Monitor health risks and avoid unnecessary traps or hazards along the way.\n\n### Recommended Action\nTo approach the exit, I will move **right** from my current position `(1, 11)` to `(1, 12)`.
