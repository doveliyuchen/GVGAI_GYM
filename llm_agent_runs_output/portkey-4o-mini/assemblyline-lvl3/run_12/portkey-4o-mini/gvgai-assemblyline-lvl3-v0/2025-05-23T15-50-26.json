The nearest lever ('m') is directly related to the potatoes and above its location (row 3, col 5).\n- Moving down or up might not change the immediate state significantly to achieve progress towards the goal.\n\n### Deciding on the Action\nGiven the position of the avatar and the nearby actions available:\n- **Use Action 1 (ACTION_USE)**, since the avatar is adjacent to a potato and can collect it.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThe expectation is that by using the action, the avatar will collect the potato enabling the next steps in the transformation process."

To transform a potato, you need to find a way to interact with either a lever or an assembly that can facilitate these transformations.\n3. The most straightforward path involves first moving towards the potato, but it may involve a series of movements depending on the current state of the board.\n\n### Action Selection\nTo begin, the most immediate action is to move downward (ACTION_DOWN) from your current avatar position (12, 5) to (13, 5). After analyzing, I deduce that this will not change your position since there is a 'b' wall directly beneath.\n\nThus, considering the strategy and layout comprehensively to optimize success in this puzzle-platformer game, I will perform:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will yield immediate feedback, and if it results in no movement, I will reassess the situation to ensure another strategy can be executed effectively."

The potato is not too far from the avatar and is located directly below at (11, 11).\n- The avatar needs to be positioned effectively to interact with the necessary sprites and bring the potato closer to the goal.\n\n### Choosing an Action\nMoving left to (12, 4) would not bring the avatar closer to the potato.

The avatar is currently in an area free of obstacles. Since there are no immediate interactions needed in this area, I will need to explore towards the potato locations.\n2. The closest potato is at (1, 11), but it would require navigating to the paths leading there which may involve moving up towards the upper rows.\n3. The goal is to eventually get the transformed potato to the goal sprite (g) at (1, 8).\n\n### Next Steps\nAs the avatar can freely move in this environment, the logical first step would be to move **up** (to (7, 6)) in order to explore a path or collect relevant items in higher rows, as there seems to be no immediate interaction from its current position.\n\n### Action Decision\n``` Action:5 ```\n\nThis action should help explore the upper area further, providing the opportunity to access necessary transformations or interact with any sprites that might lead to collecting the potatoes."
