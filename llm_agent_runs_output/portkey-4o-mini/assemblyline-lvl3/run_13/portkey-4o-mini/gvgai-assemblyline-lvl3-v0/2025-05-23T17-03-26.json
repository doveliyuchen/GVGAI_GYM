Focus on collecting **'potato' items** for transformation.\n2. Utilize levers, lasers, and vortexes effectively to clear paths or create favorable conditions.\n3. Keep track of the **time limit**.\n\n### Suggested Action\nGiven that the avatar's potential actions at current location (12, 2) include moving left or right into `e` (empty space), the next meaningful step could be to navigate towards the `j` items to collect them.\n\nSince moving left or right would rotate first (as it\u2019s the mechanics), I can execute a **left movement**.\n\nThus, the action will be:\n```Action: 2```\nThis should allow the avatar to manage better positioning towards the potato items. I expect to successfully collect items and progress towards the goal by collecting more potatoes."

After this action, I expect to see the avatar at (10, 2) with one potato collected."

    "content": "Given the current state, it is crucial to analyze the situation and make a meaningful move. \n\n### Current Observations:\n1. The avatar is located at (10, 3).\n2. There are transformations to consider, particularly with the 'j' potatoes nearby, which can eventually contribute to reaching the 'goal' at (1, 8).\n3. There are multiple available actions, including moving towards different types of floors and transforming potatoes.\n\n### Strategy Confirmation:\nTo implement a meaningful action, I need to consider the surrounding elements:\n- I see there are several 'j' (potato) sprites around my avatar at positions like (10, 2) to (10, 9). The most immediate action could be to move left or interact with a potato to transform it.\n- The objective is to collect these potatoes efficiently and transform them.\n\nSince I have the option to act that can potentially allow me to gather or transform items, I will aim to **move left** first to collect more 'potato' items.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is focused on collecting potatoes and will help progress towards reaching the required 'goal'. I expect that moving left will allow me to gather more potatoes and plan future moves accordingly."

I expect to see an increase in collected items which contributes towards higher score transformations."
