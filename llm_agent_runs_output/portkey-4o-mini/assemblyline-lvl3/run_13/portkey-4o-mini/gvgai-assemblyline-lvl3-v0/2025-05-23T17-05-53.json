I have a number of potatoes nearby which I will need to transform into their full forms for scoring points and eventually achieving victory.\n2. The area contains various walls ('b') that limit movement, along with a few levers and interactive elements that may be used for transformation.\n3. The time limit of 1500 units should be constantly considered to avoid a timeout.\n\nSince my last action did not change the position, I will choose to move to where I can interact with the potatoes.

However, several items like walls (b) are surrounding the avatar.\n\nAs per the strategy, I should first collect and transform potatoes. The important thing to notice is whether my last action changed my position or not. If I attempt to move in any direction and the position doesn't change, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nI'll attempt to navigate and collect the potato directly adjacent to my current position by moving right (to (10, 5)). The action should provide movement toward an objective and align with my strategy of optimizing potato transformations.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right seems like a logical choice as it also brings me closer to transforming the potatoes. I expect to collect and potentially convert one or more potatoes into different states."
