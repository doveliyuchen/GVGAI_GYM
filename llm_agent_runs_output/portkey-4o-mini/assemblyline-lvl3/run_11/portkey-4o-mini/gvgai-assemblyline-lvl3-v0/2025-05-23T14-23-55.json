Move towards the portal (row 2, col 22), via an optimal path if needed for further exploration.\n2. Begin collecting transformations or getting closer to the goal (row 1, col 8).\n\nSince there are no immediate items to collect in the current vicinity, moving down to (row 8, col 12) may be the best move to explore further or head back upwards toward the assembly.\n\n### Decision\nBased on the analysis, I will choose to move **down** as the immediate action to explore further on the map.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis will allow me to explore more tiles downward and potentially find something useful or navigate towards the assembly and potatoes."

The avatar can choose to **move down (11, 3)** to collect a potato, but the ground below (11, 3) is empty.\n2. Alternatively, the avatar can move in any horizontal direction, but there's a wall to the left (10, 2) leading to (10, 0) and right (10, 4) leading to more `j` (potatoes).\n\nGiven these circumstances, it's wise to collect more potatoes at (10, 1) and (10, 2) by moving left first, as it will not only improve our potato count but also open up more potential moves.\n\n### Chosen Action\nConsidering the above analysis, I will make the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n \nThis action is intended to move left, allowing us to access more potatoes (at (10, 2)) and put us on a path towards accumulating the necessary items to reach 'potatofull'. This aligns with our strategy of prioritizing transformations and collecting items to win in time."
