The best immediate action would be to go **down** (to (8, 11)) which contains a potato (j).\n\nThus, I will perform the action of moving downwards:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action is strategic as it positions me to interact with the potato, which is essential for progressing towards my transformation goal."
