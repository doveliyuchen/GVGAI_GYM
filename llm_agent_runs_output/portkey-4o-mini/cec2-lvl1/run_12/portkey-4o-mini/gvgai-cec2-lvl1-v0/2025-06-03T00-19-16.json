Specifically, I want to ensure that if I take a directional action, the avatar successfully moves and engages with different sprites, particularly aiming to transform the 'nook' into 'ok,' amongst other sprite adjustments.\n\nSince the current position (6, 2) is surrounded on the left (6, 1) and below (7, 2) by floor tiles, and moving right (6, 3) also leads to a floor tile, I will move left first to lead my exploration and interactions effectively.
