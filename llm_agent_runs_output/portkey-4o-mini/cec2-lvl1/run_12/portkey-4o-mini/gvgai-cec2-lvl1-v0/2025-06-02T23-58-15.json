(floor).\n3. **DOWN (to (7, 4))**: This leads to a wall '$', which means I can't move there.\n4. **UP (to (5, 4))**: This leads to another '#' (floor light on).\n\nFor the purpose of strategic movement focusing on the manipulation of environment sprites, I will choose to move **LEFT to (6, 3)** where there is a floor light off ('@').

The main goal is to manage sprite transformations effectively while keeping the timer in check.\n\nSince my avatar position has not changed since the last state, I need to consider my next action carefully. No left, right, up, or down movements can be performed because I must first confirm the results of my last directional action since they may have only resulted in a rotation.\n\nGiven the layout, I also see that there is an interactive mechanism with the staff which could potentially allow me to generate the necessary sprite transformations.\n\n### Suggested Action\nI will first attempt to utilize my current position for interaction with the staff, as this can allow for necessary alterations without changing the avatar's position.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nFeedback: Utilizing the staff should allow me to interact with nearby sprites, critical for adjusting states to meet win conditions. My expectation is that any successful transformation will help us progress towards eliminating the 'nook' sprites while keeping track of the timer."
