    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar 'a' is positioned at (12, 8). The nearest ingredient to collect is located at (6, 4) which is an asterisk (*) indicating an ingredient to be collected, but I must first gather the required resources in sequence. The last item I've collected was the egg (%), and now I should strategically gather the next one (the butter).\n\nThe immediate proximity of the chef '@' poses a threat as there are multiple '@' symbols around, which may indicate they are actively pursuing my avatar's position. \n\nConsidering my next steps:\n- My avatar is located at (12, 8). Given the nearby chef at (11, 6), it's crucial to move cautiously to avoid being caught.\n- The quickest, most strategic direction is to move left (ACTION_LEFT), which would place me at (12, 7). This should not only keep me away from the chef but also assess the next route towards gathering the butter in a safe manner.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is focused on maintaining distance from the chef while preparing to navigate towards collecting the next ingredient. I expect to position myself slightly away from the immediate threat as I strategize further movement towards the butter."
