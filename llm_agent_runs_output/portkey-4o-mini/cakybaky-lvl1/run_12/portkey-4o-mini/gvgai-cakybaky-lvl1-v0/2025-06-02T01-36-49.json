The current position of the avatar allows us to move directly up to where `inc1 (#)` is located.\n\n### Action Plan\nTo successfully collect `inc1 (#)`, the avatar needs to perform an upward movement. \n\n### Selected Action\n``` Action:4 ```\nThe expectation is to move directly upwards to collect `inc1 (#)` without encountering any obstacles.

    "content": "Considering the current state of the game, your avatar 'a' is located at (10, 5). The immediate objective is to collect the resources in the correct order while avoiding the chef '@', which is positioned at various coordinates nearby, and navigating through tables 'i' and walls 't'.\n\n### Observations:\n1. Your avatar is currently at (10, 5), which is a free spot (denoted by '.').\n2. The closest collectible item is 'inc3' (represented by '%'), located at (1, 4). However, to collect it, you would need to collect 'inc2' ('$' at (2, 22)) and 'inc1' ('%' at (1, 4)) first in that order.\n3. The chef is nearby at (1, 8) and (1, 24), which poses a threat if you move towards the collectibles without a proper strategy.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the above observations, it would be prudent to first orient your avatar to try and move towards the 'inc1' located at (1, 4). However, moving directly upwards could lead to coming into proximity with the chef at (1, 24). \n\nTo proceed cautiously:\n- Rotate your avatar to UP but avoid moving forward since it's an immediate threat.\n- Make a plan to move to the left or downward to navigate around the immediate threats.\n\nLet's start by taking the action to rotate up:\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\nThis allows for observation of potential move options to either avoid the chef or make a subsequent move towards 'inc1'. The expectation is to reassess the near surroundings and adjust the route to safely avoid the chef while planning to collect resources in order."

To win, the player must collect the items (in order) that correspond to inc1 through inc6 while avoiding being caught by the chef.\n\nBased on the visible map, the next resource that needs to be collected is `inc3`, represented by `%`, located at row 1 and column 4. The current position of the chef, located at multiple spots (the closest being at row 1, column 8), suggest the need for caution. \n\nGiven that the avatar did not move last turn (or we're starting from a standstill), we need to make a meaningful move. The optimal direction for the avatar is left (ACTION_LEFT) to start maneuvering towards the first resource.\n\nLet's choose the action to move left: \n``` Action:1 ``` \nMoving left seems like a strategic choice to avoid the chef and start the collection process. I expect to navigate towards the resource while keeping a safe distance from the chef."

It\u2019s crucial to avoid their paths when collecting resources.\n\n2. **Resource Collection Order**: The goal is to collect the resources in the following order:\n   - inc1 (represented by '%') which is located at row 1, col 4.\n   - inc2 (represented by '$') which is located at row 2, col 22.\n   - inc3, inc4, and so forth, up to inc6.\n\n3. **Current Movement and Strategic Planning**: \n   - The next immediate goal is to gather the first resource, inc1 ('%'), located directly above the avatar at row 1, col 4.\n   - To avoid running into the chef while making this move, it's essential to plan the next few movements carefully.\n\nBased on this analysis, the optimal action is to move **up** to collect the first resource inc1.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to enable the avatar to collect inc1 while avoiding engagement with the nearby chef."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar (a) is located at row 8, column 4, which is surrounded by walls and adversarial chefs (represented by @) at nearby positions.\n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n- The chef is positioned at (7,3), (7,4), and (7,9), which are relatively close and can easily chase the avatar.\n- The avatar needs to collect resources in a specific order: starting with inc1 (1 through inc6). Currently, the avatar has no items; therefore, the priority is to collect inc1 first, which is at the coordinate (1,4) marked by '%'.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo collect inc1, the avatar should move safely from its current position while managing proximity to enemies. Since the avatar cannot move directly left or down to avoid the chef, the best option is to first rotate in the intended direction and then move accordingly.\n\nThe avatar should take the following actions:\n1. **Turn upwards** to face north (the only direction leading towards resource inc1).\n2. **Move Up** to row 7, column 4 (facing inc1).\n3. Ideally, the avatar should consider the route after collecting each resource sequentially in the correct order.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince the current position does not change with the last action, we need to apply a directional movement first.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will attempt to move the avatar upwards, which is a strategic choice to navigate towards the first collectible resource while closely monitoring the chef's proximity. I anticipate avoiding the chef and aligning with the sequence of resource collection towards victory."
