The primary goal is to collect all required resources in order: flour, milk, egg, sugar, butter, and cherries, while avoiding the chef, denoted by '@', and the collision that would result in a score penalty.\n\n### Current Analysis\n- **Chef Positions:**\n  - There are chefs at positions (1,8), (1,24), (2,9), (2,24), (4,1), (4,8), (5,1), (6,9), (6,10), (11,6), (11,7), (12,6), and (12,7). Being near a chef can result in penalties, so careful navigation is required.\n  \n- **Available Resources:**\n  - The resources are represented by different symbols (e.g., % for sugar, * for butter, and c for cherries). The closest resource to the avatar is sugar at (1,4).\n  \n- **Walls and Tables:**\n  - There are walls (t) and tables (i) present that will block the avatar\u2019s movement. These need to be navigated carefully.\n\n### Strategy Decision\n1. **Immediate Concern:** \n   - The chef at (2,9) is relatively close, and there are multiple chefs nearby. I should move in a direction that avoids positioning myself adjacent to these chefs.\n\n2. **Resource Path:** \n   - As we are oriented to collect resources starting with flour, I\u2019m currently positioned to potentially access the resource marked with '%', which is sugar.\n\n3. **Optimal Move:** \n   - I will move **UP** to position (5,12) to direct my movement towards the sugar resource while also staying aware of the chef's positions. This position also opens further route options without immediately confronting any chefs.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move should help in advancing towards the sugar while giving a buffer away from the chefs nearby. Based on this, I expect to navigate closer to the resources while maintaining safety from direct encounters."
