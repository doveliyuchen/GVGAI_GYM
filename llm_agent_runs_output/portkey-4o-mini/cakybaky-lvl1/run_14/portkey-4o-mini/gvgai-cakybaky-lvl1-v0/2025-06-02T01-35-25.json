Move **left** again to (row 12, col 9) - another empty space.\n\nBoth movements will steer away from the chef's potential path since they are navigating either close or far away in their positions and allow me to reposition safely.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven the state analysis and positions relative to threats and resource objectives, I should initiate with the action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left is a safe immediate action to begin repositioning without interacting with the chef and opening a path towards further navigation.
