The goal is to collect ingredients in the correct order, starting with flour (symbol '#'), then milk (symbol '$'), followed by eggs ('%'), sugar ('&'), butter ('*'), and lastly cherries ('c'). \n\nLooking at the current map layout, the first ingredient (flour) is located at (10, 5). \n\nTo achieve this, my immediate action is to move UP to the row that contains the flour. Since my current position is (12, 9), moving UP one step places me in row 11 but still in column 9, which would change the coordinates to (11, 9). \n\nHowever, upon checking the map for (11, 9): it contains '@', which is another chef. Therefore, I'll need to consider movement more carefully to avoid being caught.\n\nAssessing further, the immediate approach should involve maneuvering LEFT to try and bypass the chef threat while advancing towards the ingredient's area. \n\nSince the chef occupies the adjacent column at (11, 9), my best option is to move LEFT first to (12, 8), to see if that gives me a moment to rethink my approach.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis should help me reposition away from the chef while getting closer to where I may approach the ingredient next, maintaining alignment with the ultimate goal of collecting flour in the correct order."

The path to this ingredient is blocked by several obstacles, including walls and the chef (positions marked with `@`).\n\nGiven that the chef is currently at (2, 10), you must avoid it while planning your moves. To start moving towards the ingredient in row 1, you will first need to navigate around the obstacles.\n\nThe actions available to you include moving left, right, up, or down. Since your position does not change with a single action, you should aim to rotate and then proceed with the next appropriate action.\n\nAfter analyzing your options, moving **up** to (11, 9) is a smart step as it will get you closer vertically to the row containing the egg. \n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is intended to position your avatar closer to the desired ingredient while keeping a safe distance from the chef.

Next, we need to avoid the chef ('@'), who is present in several locations, including (row 3, col 10), (row 4, col 10), and (row 9, col 8).\n\nGiven the rules and strategy recommendations, the best course of action is to move towards Flour while avoiding the chef. The plan is to navigate up towards row 4 in column 4 where the flour is located.\n\nLet's first make a move upward since the avatar is positioned at row 12. Moving up would change the position to row 11, column 10.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action attempts to reposition the avatar.

It is crucial to ensure the player avoids colliding with the chef during this process.\n\n### Action Plan\nFrom the current position (11, 10) of the avatar, the following actions should be taken to retrieve the flour first:\n\n1. Move upward (ACTION_UP) twice to get to row 9, then again to row 8 and row 7, moving towards collecting flour.\n2. After reaching row 6, the player needs to maneuver towards the left (as the flour and the path towards it is positioned to the left). The following upward movement ensures reaching the resource position at (4, 4).\n\n### Proposed Immediate Action\n``` Action: 3 ``` \nThis represents an upward movement from the current position to navigate towards the flour resource. My expectation is to make progress towards collecting the first resource while assessing threats from the chef. If the avatar moves successfully, the approach toward the next items can continue effectively."

Flour\n  2. Milk\n  3. Egg\n  4. Sugar\n  5. Butter\n  6. Cherries\n\n### Status of Collectibles:\n- The closest collectible ingredient is the egg located at (row=1, col=4) which I need to collect after collecting milk (currently I haven\u2019t collected milk yet). The milk is located at (row=1, col=5) but is currently not accessible due to a wall.\n- The nearest resource I can collect is at (row=6, col=4) which is butter.

Look at the layout; I need to navigate through obstacles to find the right path. Notably, I should not move without knowing for certain that I can collect a required ingredient.\n\n### Next Action Analysis:\nAs I could not move in the previous cycle (indicated lack of movement), I'll plan a rotational movement **toward possible next move to avoid any chef collision.** \n\nI will **ACTION_LEFT** which rotates and checks next for movable alternatives, ensuring not to collide with a chef while considering my path for the next ingredient.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nI am taking this action to maintain strategic positioning while I evaluate future options without facing the chefs directly, ensuring my next move is calculated based on the board state."
