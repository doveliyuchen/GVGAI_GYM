The nearest resource appears to be \"%\", located at (1, 4) which is essential as it is the third ingredient (eggs) that must be collected after flour and milk.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the presence of the chef sprites represented as '@', located at coordinates (1, 8), (1, 9), (4, 1), (4, 24), (6, 9), (6, 10), (11, 6), (11, 7), and (12, 6). The avatar should avoid moving too close to these positions while trying to navigate towards the resource.\n\nCurrently, the avatar can move down towards (7, 13), up towards (5, 13), left towards (6, 12), or right towards (6, 14). However, I must first analyze which of these moves will bring me closer to the resource while avoiding the chefs.\n\nGiven the layout and the actions I can take, the best immediate action is to move left towards the empty space at (6, 12). This does not directly approach the resource yet, but allows strategic positioning away from the chefs and opens potential future moves.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will reposition my avatar to (6, 12); I expect it to align with the strategy by getting out of immediate reach of nearby chefs and towards navigating further to collect the ingredients in the correct sequence."

I expect to see the avatar position change to facilitate access to surrounding ingredients while avoiding obstacles."
