The player has to collect resources in the specific order: flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter, cherries.\n2. It seems we haven't collected any resources yet. The first resource we need to collect is flour, but it's not visible in the current state description. Therefore, I will need to investigate the area to locate the flour or navigate the space effectively while avoiding the chef.\n3. The immediate surroundings, which are primarily floors (.) and potential obstacles (tables and the chef), suggest I need to move.\n\nConsidering the avatar is currently at (10, 11), I will first attempt to **move down** to explore the lower rows more effectively and potentially find the flour or access more adjacent spaces to either the right or down where resources might be present.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down is a strategic choice to explore more areas and hopefully find the flour required for the resource collection process. If my position changes, I can analyze the next steps from there while keeping an eye on the chef's proximity."

The resource for the next collection (% located at (2, 4)) can be far away from the avatar's current position, which is not ideal in terms of movement efficiency. The avatar needs to find a safe route navigating through the environment.\n2. The chef can reach the avatar quickly given their proximity. Therefore, it's crucial to move strategically.\n\n### Movement Strategy:\nSince the current position does not change from rotations, I need to analyze the situation and consider the safest action that keeps the avatar away from the potential threat while also exploring towards the resources.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI decide to move **DOWN** (to (12, 11)), as this movement keeps the avatar away from immediate threats from the chef concentrated in other rows while maintaining an openness to straighten back to resources in subsequent steps.\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\nThis action moves the avatar downwards, expecting to improve the safety situation in the vicinity and potentially clear the path toward the reachable resources afterward."
