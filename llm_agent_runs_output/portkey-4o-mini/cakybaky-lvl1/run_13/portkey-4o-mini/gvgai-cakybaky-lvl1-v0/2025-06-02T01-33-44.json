The first resource we need to get is Flour `(1)`, located at (10, 5). Moving left or down will be beneficial.\n2. Moving **Left (to 11, 9)** or **Down (to 12, 10)** both keep adjacent clear spaces and also allows potential further movement.\n\nSince moving down keeps potential for furthur right movement towards additional resources, it's more preferable here to keep options open.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nThis action is to move down. My expectation is that this provides more opportunities for further movement towards available collectibles on subsequent turns without being immediately blocked off or approached by the 'chef'."
