Collecting smoke may provide a temporary advantage against hazards.\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: Maintain a safe distance from the death sprites ('#') above (row 1, col 14) and rows where they are clustered.\n3. **Movement**: Since the avatar has not moved yet, the next action could involve moving towards a useful sprite or a resource.\n\n### Decision:\nTo begin exploration and possibly collect a smoke sprite, I will move **LEFT**.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of moving towards a sprite, thus allowing for further possibilities on the next turn based on what is found. Let's see if this move helps reveal new options."

My avatar is positioned at (row=3, col=10), surrounded by various sprites. The goal is to reach the exit located at (row=11, col=1).\n\n### Current Surroundings:\n- The avatar (`a`) is right near some death grounds (`$`), smoke (`*`), and potential obstacles such as boxes (`@`) and walls (`d`).\n- The exit (`b`) lies further down on the map.\n\n### Strategy Considerations:\n1. **Movement**: The primary action options available are to either move left, right, up, or down, and I need to ensure I avoid moving onto a death sprite (`#`) or blocking myself further.\n2. **Resources**: I see that there are collectible items like boxes, and I might need to navigate around them strategically to make progress.\n3. **Goal Orientation**: My ultimate goal is to reach the exit and I need to consider the most efficient path to do so while mitigating risks.\n\n### Avatar Movement Decision\nSince my avatar is currently at (row=3, col=10):\n- To the left (3, 9) is a smoke sprite (`*`).\n- To the right (3, 11) is another smoke sprite (`c`).\n  \nGiven that I am in a safe position (not next to a death sprite), I should explore the area to potentially gather resources or get closer to the exit.\n\n### Next Move\nI will choose to move **down to (row=4, col=10)**, as it will put me on the path downward toward the exit while maintaining options to maneuver around other sprites (considering the tight layout of boxes).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nI expect this action to navigate toward the exit and potentially open up further movement choices."
