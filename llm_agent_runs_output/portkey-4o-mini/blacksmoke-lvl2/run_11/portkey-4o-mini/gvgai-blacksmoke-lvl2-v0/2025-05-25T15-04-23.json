Based on the map and game rules, the immediate focus should be on interacting with the surroundings to gather resources and progress towards the exit.\n\nNotably, there is a collectible key located at (1, 1), and the exit is located at (11, 1). However, there are also obstacles and potential traps to consider, such as the death sprites and death ground, which I must avoid.\n\n### Action Strategy Analysis\nCurrently, I can see a box directly to the left of my avatar at (3, 10) that I cannot interact with as it is a static obstacle. Also, the path towards (1, 1) is blocked for immediate collection of the key unless I go around it. \n\nThe safest direction to explore whether it's efficient enough to plan a route towards collecting resources involves moving upward or downward along the left column where only walls and other obstacles are present. Given that I appear to be in the lower sections of the map and am still close to the row with the key, a systematic approach is warranted for resource gathering and exploration.\n\n### Selected Action\nI shall move **up** to (2, 11):\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action is based on navigating through the level safely, with the intent to progress upwards towards the row where the key resides, thus preparing for future collectible actions. I expect this action to help create more pathways for resource opportunities."
