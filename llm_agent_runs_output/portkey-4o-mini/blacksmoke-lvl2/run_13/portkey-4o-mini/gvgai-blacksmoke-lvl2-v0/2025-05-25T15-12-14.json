In this vicinity, we have a key (at (1, 1)), boxes (at (1, 2)), and several hazards denoted by '@', '#', and 'w'.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar can collect the key found at (1, 1) by moving towards it. \n2. After the key is collected, the avatar will need to decide whether to unlock the lock located at (7, 10) and strategize how to reach the exit at (11, 1).\n3. There are several hazard sprites around that could be dangerous if not avoided correctly.\n4. There is an active smokespawn on the map that produces smoke, which can be used for protection, but its location must be taken into account for efficient resource management.\n\n### Current Situation:\nSince the avatar is currently at (1, 5), moving left or down will not yield movement as there is a wall at (1, 0) and further down is hazardous. The immediate action to take is to use the up action to reach the key, thereby allowing the player to progress towards navigating the level more strategically.\n\n### Action:\n``` \nAction: 5 \n``` \nThis action moves the avatar up to (0, 5), which allows for a potential next move towards grabbing the key while positioning correctly towards the hazards.
