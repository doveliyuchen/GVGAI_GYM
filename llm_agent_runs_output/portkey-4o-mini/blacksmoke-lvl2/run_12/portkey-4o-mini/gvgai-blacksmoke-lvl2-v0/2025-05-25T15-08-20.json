Although I could push of those boxes if I have a shovel, I need to explore my options. The avatar has not moved since my last action.\n\nTherefore, moving left towards the box is the most logical action to begin interacting with that object and potentially create a pathway or gather more resources. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left allows me to engage with resources effectively and analyze the situation further. I expect this action to contribute positively towards reaching the exit while avoiding hazards."
