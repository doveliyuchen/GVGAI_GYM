Surrounding the avatar are various obstacles and resources, including boxes ('@'), death ('#'), and a final exit ('b') at (11, 1).\n\nOur immediate objective is to navigate towards the exit while collecting resources when possible. Currently, the key concern is that the avatar must avoid hazards and effectively manage any resources collected, such as using the key to open locks later.\n\nFrom the current position (3, 12), there's a box directly to the left (3, 11). Since the shovel is not present, we cannot break boxes at this point, so our best course of action is likely to move towards the exit where more pathways may be available.\n\nBased on available actions:\n\n- **Left (ACTION_LEFT)** is possible, leading to (3, 11) where a box is located.\n- **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** leads to (3, 13) which is a smoke sprite ('*').\n- **Up (ACTION_UP)** to (2, 12) is another smoke sprite.\n- **Down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (4, 12) is another wall ('d').\n\nGiven these options, my best choice is to attempt to move left towards the box and gather additional points. Although I cannot interact with the box right now, it might pave the way to further moves.\n\nThus, I will perform the move:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action leads us left, and my expectation is to position ourselves closer to the potential points of interest which we will evaluate further from there."
