The avatar 'a' is currently positioned at (5, 11). \n\nThe goal represented by '#' is located at (5, 18), and the avatar must navigate through the environment to reach it without encountering any hazards. Notably, there are several $ (holes) at positions (5, 12) to (5, 17), which could pose a threat if I attempt to move into those spaces directly.\n\n### Current Position Analysis\n1. **Avatar Position**: (5, 11)\n2. **Immediate Surroundings**: \n   - (5, 12) -> $ (hole)\n   - (5, 13) -> $ (hole)\n   - (5, 14) -> $ (hole)\n   - (5, 15) -> $ (hole)\n   - (5, 16) -> $ (hole)\n   - (5, 17) -> $ (hole)\n   - (5, 18) -> # (goal)\n\n### Decision Making\nThe avatar currently cannot move to the right, as moving into (5, 12) would result in a collision with the hole (which is a loss condition). Thus, the only immediate move that would be viable would involve either checking alternate directions or performing an action that doesn\u2019t lead to a loss condition.\n\nAccording to the overall strategy, I need to explore and find a way to navigate around the hazards:\n\n1. If I can\u2019t move directly to the right, I might need to go up or down.\n2. Moving left is not an option since it's towards a wall.\n\n### Action Selection\nGiven that other moves are not possible leading to a win or strategic advantage, the only reasonable move that does not lead to a loss is to **stay in the same position** or check my bearings further.\n\nSince the avatar hasn\u2019t moved from its last action, it\u2019s crucial to adjust my strategy. In this case, my action would be:\n\n``` \nAction: ACTION_NIL \n```\n\nThis action signifies that no movement will occur for now, allowing for a reassessment of the level situation before making a further move towards the goal, maintaining safety from hazards.

On the right (5, 12) is a hole, which is not a safe landing spot since it's a loss condition.\n3.

At this point, we have the following observations:\n\n1. **Goal Location**: The goal sprite '#' is located at (5, 18), which means it is to the right of our avatar. \n\n2. **Obstacles**: \n   - There are no immediate threats (like lasers or boulders) obstructing the direct path to the right.\n   - There is a hole '$' at (5, 12), one step to the right from the avatar, which is a hazardous location. Therefore, moving directly to the right would result in losing.\n\n3. **Strategy Orientation**: According to the overall strategy, we should avoid hazards and have a clear path to explore. We need to find a way to navigate our environment carefully.\n\nGiven this situation, we need to explore possible movements and come up with a plan that avoids the hazard while progressing towards the goal:\n\n- **Possible Actions**:\n   - **LEFT (1)**: Move to (5, 10): Safe\n   - **RIGHT (2)**: Move to (5, 12): Hazard ($)\n   - **DOWN (3)**: Move to (6, 11): Safe\n   - **UP (4)**: Move to (4, 11): Safe\n\nSince we cannot move right due to the hole and we want to avoid danger while contributing to reaching the goal, a reasonable action here would be to move down (3) to (6, 11) or explore left to (5, 10) and then analyze from there.\n\nI'll choose to move **DOWN (3)** to (6, 11) to explore further. \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is a strategic choice to avoid the hazard and will allow us more maneuverability to eventually reach the goal."

An effective strategy would involve the following steps:\n\n1. **Avoid entering the hole** by neither moving right (which would result in a loss) nor attempting an unnecessary left move at this point.\n2. **Explore opportunities** for strategic movement without changing positions for now. But the action requires moving to avoid stagnation. \n\nTherefore, the appropriate move is **down** (to (6, 11)), which allows further exploration of the layout without heading directly into danger or losing opportunity.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down to (6, 11) opens up further options to navigate around the holes while keeping the goal in sight and away from hazards."

According to the game mechanics, the current scenario may require a re-examination of the surroundings or further planning.\n\nGiven that the avatar's last action did not lead to any positional change, an action that results in another attempt or a strategic repositioning is necessary.

The goal is to navigate towards this goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar can interact with various elements in the environment, such as moving left or right to avoid boulders.\n2. The path from (5, 11) to (5, 18) is obstructed directly by several $ symbols (holes), but the goal is two spaces to the right of this point.\n3. There are boulders nearby at (2, 2), (2, 7), (6, 2), (7, 4), (12, 4), (13, 8), and (14, 2) that can cause loss conditions if collided with.\n4. The immediate two positions to the right (5, 12 and 5, 13) where the avatar can move are occupied by holes, making them inaccessible.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven that the avatar is at (5, 11) and can only move left, right, up, or down, the only feasible direction is to explore left towards (5, 10). This might help establish a path around potential hazards and seek an alternative route to the goal.\n\nBased on the strategic plan, the action chosen will be:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action moves the avatar to the left, and I expect it will allow for further exploration of the environment while maintaining safety from hazards."
