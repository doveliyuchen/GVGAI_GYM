The avatar can try moving down to (14, 10), which is still safe as there are no immediate dangers below ('a' would not enter a hole and can reconsider from this position).\n2.

The avatar needs to first make space or adjust the position relative to the boxes and boulders to avoid hazards while ensuring movement closer to the goal.\n2. The target is to move to an empty spot where strategic movements can be made.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nTo initiate movement, I will take the action of moving **down** to position (14, 9). This position is currently empty, which allows for further moves toward potential paths toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should allow the avatar further room for maneuvering without immediate hazards, following the strategy of analyzing the level and choosing a safe pathway toward the goal.

There are several obstacles (boulders '@' and holes '$') along the way that need to be navigated.\n\n#### Current Position Analysis\n- The avatar is subject to imminent hazards and obstacles. Specifically, there are boulders to the left and right, with the potential to create pathways or barriers using them.\n- The lower part of the grid (row 5) has holes that may interfere with movement if approached incorrectly.\n- The goal is positioned a significant distance away, necessitating careful planning to avoid obstacles and hazards.\n\n### Strategy Implementation\n1. **Route Evaluation**: The avatar must figure out a route towards the goal while considering hazards and obstacles. Current positioning requires navigation around boulders and avoiding being led into holes.\n\n2. **Use of Boxes/Boulders**: The avatar can possibly use surrounding boulders to create barriers against hazards or to change directions.\n\n3. **Health Management**: The avatar must avoid hazards like lengths away from holes and potential risky maneuvers that could lead to loss.\n\nGiven the need to move towards the goal and considering the relative layout and safe paths to navigate, I will choose the action that either rotates the avatar into a more advantageous position or moves downwards where the path seems clearer.\n\nConsidering the planned movement, I will execute:\n\n```Action: 3``` \n\nThis action intends to move the avatar down once, ideally positioning further away from hazards in the next iteration and evaluating surroundings for subsequent strategic moves."

The objective is to navigate the level and reach the goal (`#`) at row 5, column 18 while avoiding hazards and obstacles.\n\nGiven the layout:\n- The immediate obstacles are spatially aligned with walls (`%`), which block movement.\n- There are several boxes and boulders in the vicinity which may be used to navigate efficiently or to shield against potential hazards (like lasers, although none are visible in the immediate area).\n\nTo strategize:\n1. I need to observe the area for potential movement routes toward the goal while avoiding walls and ensuring safety from hazards.\n2. The goal is in the fifth row, but the path is obstructed by walls. Therefore, I need to find a way up and then navigate around the walls horizontally.\n\nCurrently, my avatar can perform a move in the left (to column 8), right (to column 10), down (to row 16), or upward (to row 14).\n\nTo explore the area, moving first to the left might allow a perspective on neighboring obstacles and clear additional routes. \n\nThus, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left may provide more options for navigating around obstacles or identifying a better strategic route!"
