Given its current position, there is a straight line of movement that leads to the goal without interaction with any immediate threats:\n\n- Moving **right** from `(5, 11)` to `(5, 12)` encounters a hole.\n- Moving **right** again from `(5, 12)` to `(5, 13)` also encounters more holes.\n- Continuing this would result in navigating around obstacles until reaching `(5, 18)`.\n\nTo clarify, the paths moving down, up, or left do not present an immediate advantage either, as they would either lead to walls or extend the distance to the goal.\n\n### Decision\nGiven these dynamics, we need to maneuver around the holes to reach the goal.

The ultimate goal is at (5, 18).\n- There are several holes ($) immediately adjacent to the avatar's current position, specifically at (5, 12) to (5, 15).\n- The direct path to the right of the avatar (at (5, 12) to (5, 18)) is blocked by holes and walls.\n\n### Objective:\nCurrently, the objective is to find a clear path towards the goal while avoiding the holes and potential threats.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Actions:\n1. **Moving Right (Action 2)**: \n   - This will lead to first moving into a hole ($) at (5, 12), which results in game loss.\n\n2. **Moving Left (Action 1)**: \n   - This would take the avatar back to an already occupied position at (5, 10), which is not immediately useful.\n\n3. **Moving Up (Action 4)**: \n   - The area above (row 4: (4, 11)) is a wall, thus this action is invalid.\n\n4. **Moving Down (Action 3)**: \n   - This would take the avatar to row 6, column 11 (also a wall), making this action invalid as well.\n\nConsidering that the available movements (left, right, up, down) do not provide a means of progressing toward the goal due to obstacles, the best course of action would be to evaluate pushing a nearby box or attempting some other strategic maneuver. \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the position of the avatar won\u2019t change based on the valid directional potential, and adding an action like `ACTION_NIL (0)` wouldn't yield progress either, I must make an alternate move. Given the unique situation, I will initiate a **downward movement**, even if the immediate prospects appear limited:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nWhile this move might seem counterintuitive since the next potential moves from that position will also face obstacles, it\u2019s imperative to explore all spatial options and configurations for future moves.

Additionally, since the next available column after the current (5, 11) has terrain I cannot move through (it's a wall),  I can only move up and down at this point.\n\nGiven that I need to effectively navigate the obstacle layout to plan my next move due to the fixed positioning, my next actions will focus on either moving up or down to a suitable row and then left/right accordingly to approach the goal.\n\nSince my position didn't change from the last action, and the only available action that immediately gets me closer towards a strategy of heading towards the goal while avoiding risks is to **act in an up direction** first, this should rotate me into a position where I can evaluate my next possible actions. \n\n### Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move will allow me to reposition to row 4, opening up new possibilities for further movement towards the goal while staying cautious of pitfalls from the layout."

Since the avatar is currently unable to move directly to the right without falling into a hole, I might want to look left, down, or interact with nearby boulders.\n\n### Actions Available:\n1. **Left (1)**: Moves the avatar to `(5, 10)` which is a wall (`%`).\n2. **Right (2)**: Attempts to move to `(5, 12)` directly into a hole (`$`).\n3. **Down (3)**: Moves to `(6, 11)` which is open (`.`).\n4. **Up (4)**: Moves to `(4, 11)` which is also open (`.`).\n\n### Decision:\nThe option to move down (`3`) to `(6, 11)` is safest as it allows a clear pathway away from the immediate threat of the hole and might provide opportunities to navigate towards another area that could lead to the goal. \n\nExecuting this action maintains progress in the game without immediate risk:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: By moving down, I'll strategize further around the avatar's position without risking immediate death from the hole present to the right.

Specifically, the hole occupies row 5, columns 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, leading directly to the goal (`#`) located at (5, 18).\n- Since the holes are present next to the avatar, moving down would place the avatar directly into a hole, resulting in an immediate loss.\n- The walls (`%`) surround most of the board, restricting movement. \n\n### Available Actions:\nBecause the avatar is surrounded by holes to the right and below, the safest and most strategic move would be to shift left (ACTION_LEFT) to try to navigate away from the danger:\n\n### Execution of Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to move left to (5, 10), which would allow the avatar to avoid falling into a hole and keeps it aligned towards making progress towards the goal.

The map shows my avatar located at (5, 11) and the goal at (5, 18). \n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n- My current position (5, 11) has nothing but the avatar itself.\n- The goal position (5, 18) is to the right of my current position, separated by columns that contain only ground and one obstacle (it seems to be a hole at (5, 12)(5, 13)(5, 14)(5, 15) and possibly we need to clear them before reaching the goal).\n\n**Strategy Application:**\nFollowing the strategy, the most rational action is to move to the right where the path is free of immediate hazards. Moving right is the initial step toward reaching the goal.\n\n```Action: 2``` \n\nThis action should take me closer to the goal while avoiding threats. I expect this aligns with the strategy of systematically reducing the distance to the goal while ensuring the avatar's safety."

The objective is to reach the goal positioned at row 5, col 18 while avoiding obstacles such as boulders (`@`), holes (`$`), and walls (`%`).\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- The immediate area around the avatar contains holes (row 5, col 12 to 14), which cannot be passed.\n- The goal (row 5, col 18) is placed quite far, and the path is obstructed by holes directly below the avatar moving toward the goal.\n- There are boulders present in various rows below that potentially create obstacles.\n\nGiven these conditions, the avatar must first reposition to avoid the vertical limit imposed by the holes before proceeding toward the goal.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- The first logical move from the current position is to move down (action 3), since moving left or right won't help avoid the holes, and moving up isn't possible due to the top wall.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow me to move downwards, creating better access to navigate around the obstacles towards my goal while following the outlined strategy.
