Valid move.\n   - **RIGHT (5, 11)**: (5, 10) would move to (5, 11), which is also clear (`.`). Valid move.\n\n2. **Evaluate the next possible moves:**\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (5, 9) does not progress towards the goal and keeps me away from hazards.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 11) keeps me on the safe path, allowing for further potential movement toward my goal after evaluating the new position.\n\nGiven that my last action and current position have not changed significantly yet, I should opt for the RIGHT move which might provide a clearer pathway towards the goal on the right after I analyze the layout from there.\n\nThus, the best action is to move RIGHT towards (5, 11).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right will help me stay clear of holes and get closer to the goal while I can evaluate the next steps."

The position of the avatar is crucial to determine the next action. Given that moving left, right, up, or down could lead to the avatar's death by falling into holes or not advancing towards the goal, caution is required.\n\nCurrently, the safest action is to move **right** to (5, 12). However, this position contains a hole, which will kill the avatar. So, we cannot actually move right. \n\nLooking at the layout, the avatar can only move **left** towards (5, 10), which is a free space. This move also keeps the avatar from falling into the holes on its right. Moving left will result in a safe square and allow for better planning toward reaching the goal without any immediate hazards.\n\nTherefore, I will choose:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left is the best option to prevent falling into any holes while still keeping possibilities open for future movements toward the goal (#)."

As per the rules, a rotation occurs for directional actions without movement. Since the avatar is facing right, the action to rotate left will allow me to attempt to move in an alternative direction next.\n\n### Next Action:\nSo I will attempt to perform a left rotation with no movement, then I will successfully try moving down to see if that opens up a path.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis rotation makes logical sense as I need to reposition my avatar away from the immediate hazards.
