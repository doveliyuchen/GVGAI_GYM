Surroundings:\n   - Right (5, 12): hole ('$') - dangerous to move.\n   - Left (5, 10): wall ('%') - cannot move.\n   - Up (4, 11): wall ('%') - cannot move.\n   - Down (6, 11): wall ('%') - cannot move.\n\n2. **Current Objective**: The goal is at position (5, 18), and the avatar needs to progress towards that goal by finding a valid exit route.\n\nGiven that the avatar cannot move in any of the four potential direction options from its current position, the only logical action is to check if any rotations or changes can be made. Since no movement can happen, the next step is to rethink the strategic maneuvering.\n\nSince there's no immediate action leading to movement and the avatar is trapped by walls or holes, executing **ACTION_NIL** (doing nothing) is the viable choice as analyzing further might yield alternative strategic directions only after the current state is examined thoroughly.\n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with the planned action:\n\n``` Action:0 ``` \n\nI believe this is prudent under the circumstances, as the avatar can't move from its current position due to obstructions.

However, since the previous action has to be checked before any new actions are taken, we must examine the possibility of another direction.\n\nMoving upwards towards (4, 10) appears to be an option, but that is less ideal as there are walls (impassable).\n\n**Conclusion**: Given the immediate hazards and surroundings, the best action is to **not move to the right (to avoid holes)** and **not down (due to the boulder)**. \n\nTherefore, the only safe option to avoid falling into the hole is to **move left into free space**.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action seems aligned with the strategy of avoiding hazards while progressing toward the goal piece without making the avatar immobile.

The goal is also located directly to the right of the holes at (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 14), (5, 15), (5, 16), and (5, 17).\n\n2. **Use Boxes Wisely**: There are no boxes available in the avatar's current vicinity to use as shields against hazards.\n\n3. **Plan Movement**: The avatar needs a safe path toward the goal without falling into any holes. The current row has consecutive holes immediately adjacent to the goal, which means we need to navigate wisely.\n\n4. **Avoid Hazards**: The holes present a clear danger if the avatar tries to move right towards the goal at this moment.\n\n5. **Keep Score in Mind**: Since there are holes ahead, any attempts to shift right appear risky without a safety net.\n\n6. **Progress Systematically**: To effectively progress towards the goal while avoiding holes, it may be prudent to first move left to explore alternatives.\n\nGiven the state of play, the best action at this moment would involve maneuvering the avatar left. This may allow for exploring another potential path or just reevaluating the current position to ensure there aren\u2019t any alternative movements available.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left allows us to reassess the situation and potentially find a better route towards the goal."
