Since moving directly right will cause an immediate loss, I will need to explore using the vertical options or strategize around the boxes surrounding these holes to reach the path leading to the goal.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I have to act differently from my last movement attempt and verify whether I can leverage other available actions effectively.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis translates to moving left (though in this context, it might be unnecessary, but it helps to take stock of the potential movement and check my surroundings more effectively).

Since the goal is just two spaces away from the right of the holes, you will need to find a way to navigate through these holes without going into them.\n\n### Strategy Based on the Rules:\n- To progress forward without risking falling into a hole, an important step is to assess how the interaction mechanics work. Since the avatar is currently at (5, 11), moving to the right would typically put the avatar at (5, 12), which is a hole.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. Check the possibility of other interactions or avoidance strategies.\n2. Since the avatar cannot move right due to an immediate danger, we may consider:\n   - Initiating a left or up/down movement may provide an alternate approach,\n   - However, left (5,10) is also thought to be a wall.\n\n### Action Recommendation:\nWith no immediate options to progress right due to the hole, a better plan is to consider going back left to observe any other alternatives.\n\nTherefore, the recommended action is to move left as there are no other choices that allow progression toward the goal. \n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is based on the need to reset the position strategically and see if any new avenues present themselves for safely bypassing the holes without falling in."

    "content": "Based on the provided state of the game, I will analyze the current position of the avatar ('a') located at (5, 11) on the grid.\n\n### Current Board State Overview:\n- Avatar (`a`) is at (5, 11).\n- Surroundings:\n  - Left (5, 10): Wall (%)\n  - Right (5, 12): Hole ($)\n  - Down (6, 11): Wall (%)\n  - Up (4, 11): Wall (%)\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **Left (5, 10)**: This is occupied by a wall. Can't move left.\n2. **Right (5, 12)**: This is a hole. Moving here may have consequences based on game rules.\n3. **Down (6, 11)**: This is a wall. Can't move down.\n4. **Up (4, 11)**: This is also a wall. Can't move up.\n\n### Strategy Implications:\nSince the avatar is surrounded by walls on three sides and one side is a hole, the only option available for potential movement is to proceed right into the hole. The specified nature of holes in the game could either represent a scoring opportunity or a potential loss, but based on the state, contributing effectively to the objective implies taking this action.\n\n### Conclusion and Action:\nConsidering the analysis and the strategy to avoid stagnation (repeating the last action), I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right into the hole. I expect to see what effect this has in terms of scoring or game progression concerning the hole's mechanics."

There are several holes ($) located between my avatar and the goal, as well as other sprites that may affect my movement including boulders (@) that are near, but not directly obstructing the path to the goal.\n\nTo successfully reach the goal, I need to consider using the holes for either scoring or avoiding obstacles. However, since my current position does not risk elimination from lasers or walls and I have a direct path to the goal, I am strategically focused on reaching it.\n\nSince the avatar's position has not changed since the analysis and considering the straight-line path towards the goal (which is 7 columns to the right), the best course of action is to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is aimed at moving towards the goal directly, maximizing my strategy of planning movements towards victory while also avoiding any risks. I expect this action to align with the strategic approach of ensuring a clear path toward the ultimate objective."
