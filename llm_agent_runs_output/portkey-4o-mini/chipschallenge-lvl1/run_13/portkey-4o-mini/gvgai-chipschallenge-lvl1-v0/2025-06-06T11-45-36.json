We keep track of necessary resources and avoid unnecessary risks.\n2. Since we're very close to the exit, it's logical to navigate towards it.\n\n### Planning the Action:\n- The avatar should **move right** to (row=9, col=8) to collect a chip and go another step right towards the exit.\n\nSince the avatar's position will change after moving right, we can proceed with that action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will help gather a chip and lead closer to the exit, aligning with the goal to maximize score and reach the exit efficiently."
