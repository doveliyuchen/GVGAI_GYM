There are chips (c) at (9, 8) that can be collected. Collecting chips contributes to the score, aligning with the game's objectives. However, the avatar is currently positioned towards the end of the map, with the exit located at (9, 10).\n\n### Strategy\nSince the avatar is adjacent to a chip at (9, 8), the most efficient action now would be to move right to collect this chip. Collecting this chip does not pose any immediate hazard. Additionally, it brings the avatar one step closer to the exit (9, 10).\n\n### Decision\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar right to collect the chip, maximizing resource collection while maintaining a course toward the exit.
