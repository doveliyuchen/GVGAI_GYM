The objective is to collect and transform potatoes into \"potatofull\" to reach the goal.\n\nAccording to the strategy provided, the first step should be to collect a potato and then begin the transformation process. The closest potato is at (1, 4), which is a significant distance away. \n\nHowever, since your avatar can interact with other objects as well, we can optimize the movements by first moving downward towards the potatoes and leveraging any vortex or assembly that aids in reaching the transformation points.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move **down** to explore further configurations or collect a potato as needed, without changing the position from where you are currently located.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nBy opting to move down, I expect the avatar to explore further and approach a collection point for a potato, aligning with the strategy to gather and transform as efficiently as possible."
