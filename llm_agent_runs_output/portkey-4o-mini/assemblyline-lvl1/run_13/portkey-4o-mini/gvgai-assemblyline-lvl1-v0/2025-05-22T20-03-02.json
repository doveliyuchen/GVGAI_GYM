There are assembly sprites (represented by '@', '#', and '$') in nearby rows, which may be necessary for transforming the potatoes.\n3. The avatar should avoid hazards like walls ('w') and vortexes ('v') while finding a path towards the objective.\n\nGiven the avatar's existing position, a strategic action is required.

I expect to see the avatar move up to (9, 9) to (9, 9), indicating a rotation if no movement occurs, and we will subsequently need to re-evaluate the next action based on the updated state."

It is necessary to consider a different action than before if it was directed movement. \n\n### Strategic Move:\nSince the avatar is positioned at (11, 4), the immediate approach should be to interact with the surroundings and find a way to either reach a lever or an assembly that might help with the transformation of a potato.\n\nCurrent strategy:\n- The player should prioritize moving to one of the potatoes or an assembly.\n\n#### Proposed Action:\nThe action I will take is to move **UP** to (10, 4) where there is another potato present. \n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action is intended to bring the avatar closer to potato resources for potential transformation and aligns with the strategy of collecting critical items efficiently."

Hence, I should examine the surrounding layout for the next action.\n\nGiven the available actions and the importance of interacting with the nearby 'h' (potato) to transform, it makes sense to move up to the potato in a more efficient and strategic manner.\n\nI will execute the action to move **up**:\n\n```Action: 5```\n\nThis action should help me get closer to the goal of reaching and transforming the potato, aligning well with the strategy of progressively transforming potatoes and maintaining a focus on the objectives."

The avatar can collect potatoes, and there are also assembly sprites below (row 12 contains potatoes).\n\nCurrently, the action plan would involve interacting with the potatoes. The most logical action here is to move up or down to collect a potato, since both adjacent rows have a potato.\n\n### Selecting an Action:\nSince the avatar's last action did not change its position (and to follow the instruction to take a different action), I will choose to move **up** to collect one of the potatoes.\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nI expect that this action will allow the avatar to collect a potato, which is a foundational step toward transforming it for the victory sprite."
