The action should prioritize moving towards the goal if possible.\n\n### Potential Actions\n1. **Assess Movement Options:**\n   - The avatar can move:\n     - Left to `(6, 12)` (which brings it closer to the goal at `(6, 8)`).\n     - Down, Up, or Right, but those paths do not bring it closer to the goal.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the avatar should move towards the goal for a potential victory condition and the lack of direct obstacles, the most fruitful action is to move left.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action intends to move the avatar left (from `(6, 13)` to `(6, 12)`), which aligns with the strategy of moving closer to the goal."

The goal itself is located on row 6, column 8 (marked as 'j').\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. **ACTION_USE** would typically be used to interact with an item.\n2. **ACTION_LEFT** would attempt to move the avatar left (to column 3).\n3. **ACTION_RIGHT** would attempt to move right (to column 5).\n4. **ACTION_DOWN** would move down (to row 9, column 4), where there is another potato sprite ('h').\n5. **ACTION_UP** would try to move up (to row 7, column 4), where there is an empty floor ('.').\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n- Moving **DOWN** to row 9, column 4 will place the avatar in direct contact with a potato sprite ('h'), leading to a potential transformation.\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** does not yield any immediate benefits since both adjacent squares contain empty floor ('.').\n\nGiven that our strategy emphasizes gathering potatoes as a priority and the significant number of potato sprites nearby, the most advantageous action is to **move DOWN**.\n\n### Selected Action\n```Action:4```\nMoving down allows us to collect a potato sprite, essential for progressing towards transforming it and achieving the victory condition."

I will take an action towards moving to the next potato sprite directly accessible from the avatar's current position. \n\nSince the avatar is currently at (11, 4), to the immediate left (11, 3) and moving down to (12, 4) is possible and will potentially allow for more direct interactions.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will choose to move down to (12, 4) to access another potato sprite without obstruction.\n\n```Action:4```\n\nThis action is expected to help in collecting and interacting with the potato and moving closer to transforming it towards the victory condition."
