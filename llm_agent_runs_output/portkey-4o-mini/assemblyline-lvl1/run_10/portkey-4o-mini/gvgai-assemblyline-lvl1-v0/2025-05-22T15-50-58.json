Since the avatar is surrounded by 'potato' sprites, it can benefit from converting them into other states by moving towards them.\n\n### Action Selection\nGiven that the avatar is currently facing a possibility to move left or right and might not have effectively utilized interaction since it hasn't changed positions:\n\n- The most strategic move now would be **to move left** toward (11, 4), where it can interact with a `potato` sprite.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action to move left is anticipated to bring the avatar closer to the potato sprite, allowing for possible transformation upon interaction."

The objective is to transform 'potato' sprites found in our vicinity, mainly those at positions (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (9, 4), and (10, 4).\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. **Obstacles**: \n   - The avatar is surrounded by walls (`w`), particularly surrounding columns (0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10-24).\n   - The floor around contains a mix of 'potato' sprites (`h`), assemblies (`@`, `$`), and hazards like the vortex (`v`) at (2, 3) and (4, 3).\n\n2. **Action Options**: \n   - The immediate left `(9, 3)` and right `(9, 5)` are both empty spaces, but the top and bottom have potatoes and other interactive elements. \n\n3. **Strategic Goals**:\n   - We need to collect and transform the potatoes into a 'victory' sprite, which requires traversing the assemblies and interacting with them without hitting any hazards.\n\n### Analysis for Action:\nSince my current position does not change after the last action, I should consider an action that moves the avatar closer to transforming a potato sprite. Interacting with the potato at (9, 4) is a good option, or directly transforming another potato sprite nearby can lead to progression.\n\nConsidering we just rotated and haven\u2019t moved, it makes sense to either use `ACTION_USE` on the potato at (9, 4) directly or navigate to `ACTION_DOWN` at (10, 4) for further interactions with the assembly below.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nUsing the action to interact with the potato sprite will allow me to start the transformation process, progressing towards the ultimate goal of reaching the 'victory' sprite. I expect to see a change in the game state indicating the progress with the potato transformation."
