The key at (1, 1) is vital to progress toward the goal. We need to strategize our movements to reach it.\n2. There are obstacles on the path, including walls and holes.\n3. There are boxes ('@') we can manipulate, located at (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We'll need to consider how to utilize these.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the avatar position is unclear in the provided state, we must assume that we could start somewhere in proximity to the key, moving towards it seems to be the most logical strategy to initiate our progression. The direct approach involves moving towards the key first.\n\nGiven that our avatar hasn't been indicated, we will assume a starting position directly below the key at (2, 1) in order to access it.\n\n### Decision:\nTo reach the key located at (1, 1), we will first move left or up. The safest option given the layout is to take the action that brings us closer to the key while avoiding any immediate hazards.\n\nChoosing **UP** as our first action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action should bring our avatar closer to the key without encountering any walls or hazards.
