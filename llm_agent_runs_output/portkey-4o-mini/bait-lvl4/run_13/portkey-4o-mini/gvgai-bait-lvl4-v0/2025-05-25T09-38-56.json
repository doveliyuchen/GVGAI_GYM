Up to (3, 2) but that is a mushroom ('&') which is hazardous and will cause a loss if you interact.\n3. Further up to (2, 2) would then allow you to either move left to (2, 1) which is another hole or (2, 3) which is clear.\n\nIn order to reach the key at (1, 1), you'll need to move strategically through the boxes and not interact with the holes or mushrooms directly.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince the surrounding area is filled with hazards, it\u2019s best to first check if I can bounce off the box available at (4, 2) and then strategize from there. However, the first move should clearly be to **move up** to reach the box at (4, 2).\n\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\nThis action is to move up towards the box.
