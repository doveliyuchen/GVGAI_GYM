However, I cannot do this unless I obtain the key.\n\n### Observations\n- There are no holes or immediate threats close to my position.\n- The key ('%') is located at (1, 1), meaning significant movement is required to collect it.\n- To transition to the 'withkey' state, I would need to navigate from my current position towards the key, avoiding walls and other hazards.\n\n### Proposed Action\nConsidering the layout:\n- I can move left (to (6, 2)) or right (to (6, 4)), where either direction leads to box tiles. \n- Moving up to (5, 3) would provide a path toward (4, 3) where more boxes are located, but I cannot immediately get to the key without significant further navigation.\n\nAfter analyzing the possible moves, I plan to move **up** first, so I can assess if there are better maneuvering options available in the next state.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows me to explore higher ground and assess my options without falling into any hazards since there are no immediate threats in the upward direction.

The goal (denoted as '#') is located at (row=7, col=4). The key (denoted as '%') is located at (row=1, col=1).\n\nNow, we need to determine which action is most meaningful. The main objectives based on the gameplay mechanics are to collect the key and eventually reach the goal.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of the mechanics relevant to my position:\n- I can only collect the key and then proceed towards the goal if I am in a position to avoid hazards such as falling into holes (denoted as '$') or interacting with mushrooms (denoted as '&').\n- As I have no key right now, my first priority should be to reach the key.\n\nFrom my current position at (5, 3):\n- Up (to 4, 3) will move to a box ('@').\n- Down (to 6, 3) will move to a floor ('.').\n- Left (to 5, 2) will move to a box ('@').\n- Right (to 5, 4) will move to a floor ('.').\n\nSince my immediate goal is to reach the key at (1, 1), I will need to navigate upward but avoid rolling back. Moving up towards (4, 3) first will help me move towards the upper path later.\n\nTaking the upward direction is a valid move considering the strategy to access the key later, as I will be moving closer to pathways that could lead toward the key.\n\nSince I am currently positioned at (5, 3), I will take the upward action first:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up takes me toward the interaction point I'm seeking, helping in eventual navigation to the key and avoiding immediate hazards in the route."
