This move keeps the avatar safe and allows for future movement options toward the goal or towards collecting the key.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nI expect this action to maintain the plan to traverse toward the lower part of the map and position myself for potential moves toward both the key and the goal in subsequent turns."

Since the key is towards the upper row, I will first check if I can move up from my current position. However, I can only move up to (4, 3), which is not the optimal path as it doesn't get me closer to the key effectively. \n\nInstead, the safest and most strategic first step is to move left to (5, 2).
