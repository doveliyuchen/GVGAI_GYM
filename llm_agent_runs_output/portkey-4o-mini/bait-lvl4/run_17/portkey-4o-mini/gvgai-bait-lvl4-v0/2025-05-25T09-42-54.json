The avatar cannot move toward the goal (`#`) at row 7, column 4 without first collecting the key.\n- The **key** (`%`) is located at row 1, column 1. The avatar needs to navigate to this key first.\n- The **mushroom** (`&`) at row 3, column 2 and various **holes** (`$`) present obstacles that must be carefully avoided.\n\nFrom the current avatar position (5, 3), the only viable direction to consider for movement toward the key is **up** to row 4, column 3. I will check if moving up will encounter a wall or any danger.\n\n### Action Selection\n- I will execute the action to move **UP (4)** from (5, 3) to (4, 3), which is safe as it leads to a box (`@`) and allows further movements toward the key.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to strategically position the avatar closer to potential safe routes while avoiding hazardous tiles, aligning with the strategy of collecting the key first."

Moving left (to (3, 2)) would place the avatar directly in contact with a mushroom, resulting in a loss.\n2. Moving right (to (3, 4)), which is a floor space, looks safe.\n3. Moving down (to (4, 3)), which is also a floor space, looks safe.\n4. Moving up (to (2, 3)), which is a floor space, looks safe.\n\nSince the main objective is to work towards the key first, I will choose to move up from (3, 3) to (2, 3). \n\nFollowing this plan aligns with the strategy of avoiding obstacles and walking towards the key first.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nThis action is to move up to (2, 3) and is expected to help in progressing towards the key while overlooking obstacles."

The key for unlocking the goal is located at (1, 1).\n2. The goal is located at (7, 4), and we need to reach it after obtaining the key.\n3. The avatar needs to navigate up to where the key is, while avoiding obstacles (holes and mushrooms).\n\n### Movement Strategy:\nTo move towards the key, I can either:\n- Move up from (4, 3) to (3, 3). \n- This action leads to exploration, and I must reassess the position afterwards.\n\nSince moving to (3, 3) doesn't result in immediate danger or obstruction, I will proceed with that action.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will bring the avatar upward, and I expect to gather further insights into the path toward the key and the overall layout."
