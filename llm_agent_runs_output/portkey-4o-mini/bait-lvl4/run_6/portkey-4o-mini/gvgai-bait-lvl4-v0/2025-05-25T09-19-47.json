Therefore, I should move down to row 6, col 2 (the location of the box).\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven my avatar's position and the goal, the next logical move is to move downwards to position myself for the key collection.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow me to position next to the box, setting me up to eventually collect the key and progress towards the goal efficiently."

Therefore, I will choose to move 'RIGHT' to (1, 1) to collect the key.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should align with my strategy to prioritize collecting the key before moving to the goal.

However, to make progress, I'll assume the avatar is located at a previously indicated position (not interacting with walls).\n- The key ('%') is located at (1,1). This should be our immediate target to collect, as the goal ('#') is at (7,4), which we can only access after collecting the key.\n\n### Key/Goal Strategy\n1. **Collecting the Key**: Prioritizing the acquisition of the key is essential for unlocking the goal.\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: The holes ('0') located on the map are lethal, requiring careful navigation around these areas.\n\n### Movement Options\n- Since there's no clear avatar position provided, let\u2019s assume we can only take a reasonable action to head towards the key. \n\nGiven the key is located at (1,1) and considering a direction towards the key might be appropriate, I would suggest:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action means moving left.
