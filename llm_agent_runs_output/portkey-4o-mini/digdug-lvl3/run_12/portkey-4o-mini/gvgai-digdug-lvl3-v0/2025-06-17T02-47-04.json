All options to move left are blocked. Moving right is generally safer than moving down where there are also chances of encountering monsters directly.\n\n### Selected Action:\nTo stay clear of monsters and to continue exploring the map effectively, I will choose to move **right**.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right to (13, 2) will allow me to continue exploring and collecting items while staying clear of immediate threats posed by the monsters. I expect to see some possible items or clearer pathways in the next state."
