Since I'm positioned quite far from the gold and gems, I should either move toward the nearest collectible or create a path to avoid danger.\n2. I need to avoid moving toward the monster directly as it's currently right next to the leftmost wall (13, 25), and if I go left, I won't be able to interact with any collectibles without risking the monster encounter.\n\nGiven this analysis, my best action to start is to move towards the collectible at (11, 8) which is upward from my current position.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action will move my avatar up to (12, 1), repositioning me closer to the gems.
