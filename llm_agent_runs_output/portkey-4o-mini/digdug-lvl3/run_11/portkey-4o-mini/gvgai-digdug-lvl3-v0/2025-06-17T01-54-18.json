The lower (15, 5) position is also a wall while the upper (13, 5) position has a monster ('*').\n   \n2. **Current Strategy Review**: The strategy emphasizes collecting items while avoiding direct encounters with monsters, hence avoiding the immediate area of the monster is vital.\n\n3. **Identifying Immediate Actions**:\n   - We have a shovel, which we can use to interact with objects effectively, and the area around us seems relatively clear.\n   - The next logical step is to collect the shovel, which is present at (14, 4), as it can help manipulate boulders and clear paths if needed later on.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo maintain movement and fulfill our objectives based on the available strategy, I will act on the nearby shovel located at (14, 4). The action consists of using the shovel.\n\n```Action: 1```\nThis action is expected to aid in dynamic movement and expand options for future turns, aligning well with the overarching strategy of manipulation and collection."

Additionally, moving up will lead closer to the left column which has potential goodies in (3, 10) and (11, 8) and (11, 9).\n\n3. **Monitoring the Monster**:\n   - The positioned monster is at (13, 18), which is a reasonable distance away from your current position. There is also a wall blocking a potential line of sight, giving a bit of room to navigate without immediate risk of collision.\n\n### Decision\nAs you have the opportunity to move upwards (which will allow further movements towards potentially collecting more items soon), I will choose to move up into (13, 6).\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nMoving up towards (13, 6) is strategic as it opens up potential routes to further goodies above while keeping a safe distance from the monster."
