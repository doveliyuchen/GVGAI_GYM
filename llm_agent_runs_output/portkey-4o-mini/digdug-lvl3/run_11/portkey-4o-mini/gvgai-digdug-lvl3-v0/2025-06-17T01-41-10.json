The key options are moving left (to (13, 0)), right (to (13, 2)), or down (to (14, 1)), but moving right is not advisable as it will lead to an immediate loss.\n\nThe only safe move in this scenario is to go left to empty space (13, 0) to create distance from the monster. \n\nThus, I will execute the left movement:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action should get me away from the immediate threat of the monster and allow further strategic planning in subsequent turns."

Since your current position does not change, you need to assess alternative actions. \n\nIn this scenario, the options available are limited due to the walls around your avatar's position.

However, moving UP (to (12, 0)) is a safe move and allows for exploration of the upper rows without directly encountering threats.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\n\nThis action will move the avatar up to (12, 0), and I expect to explore the space above, ideally finding more goodies while avoiding the monster."

Given the situation, we can either try to move away from the monster or utilize the shovel if it can create a beneficial circumstance.\n\n### Current Analysis:\n- **Options**: \n  - **Left (to (13, -1))**: Out of bounds.\n  - **Right (to (13, 1))**: Blocks the monster.\n  - **Down (to (14, 0))**: Safe space.\n  - **Up (to (12, 0))**: Wall.\n  \n### Selected Action:\nMoving down (`ACTION_DOWN`) to (14, 0) is a safe choice that puts distance between the avatar and the monster.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move allows you to avoid the monster while staying active in the game."

The entrance is located at (13, 25).\n\nSince moving directly left or down from the current position will either collide with walls or the monster, I will need to take an action that avoids the monster and begin navigating towards the right side of the map where more goodies can be found. My focus is on survival and finding a path that allows for gathering gems and gold while avoiding the monster.\n\nContinuing from the previous action, I will turn around since any potential movement to the left or down is obstructed.
