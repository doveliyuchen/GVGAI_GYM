To the right, there is a goal with an immediate exit (row=13, col=25). There's no direct risk from the monster right now, but we should avoid going too close without a strategy. Since there's no immediate movement available in terms of collecting goodies, the next logical step is to look for paths leading to goods without heading towards possible danger.\n\n### Suggested Action\nGiven the above analysis, the action that would be most beneficial is to check left towards (row=13, col=0) or upwards to find potential paths. Since your avatar is located at (row=13, col=1) and no movement was indicated last time, a potential smart move would be to use the shovel towards making space or viewing more options.\n\n``` Action: ACTION_LEFT ``` \n\nThis keeps us safe for now while assessing the surroundings for next optimal moves.
