The avatar is currently low on immediate danger but moving into a better position may be advantageous.\n3. **Next Move:** Since the last action didn't change the avatar's position, and the objective is to advance toward enemies while remaining safe, effective targeting needs to commence.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven all of this, I will choose to move the avatar left to (10, 0) for better coverage and aiming at any possible aliens to the left. This action will provide an advantageous angle to start attacking the aliens while still maintaining distance.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving left allows for a better strategic position in terms of targeting incoming aliens while minimizing danger from bomb sprites."
