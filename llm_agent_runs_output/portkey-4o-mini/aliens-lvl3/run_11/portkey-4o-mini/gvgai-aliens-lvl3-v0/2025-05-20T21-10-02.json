However, given the current position of the avatar, moving to the right (ACTION_RIGHT) would provide a better position for future actions against the alien threat.

We should prioritize changing our position to avoid having our avatar in a static position vulnerable to lower-threatening movements.\n\n### Decision:\nChoosing a horizontal directional action may not lead to immediate threats but provides more room for movement.
