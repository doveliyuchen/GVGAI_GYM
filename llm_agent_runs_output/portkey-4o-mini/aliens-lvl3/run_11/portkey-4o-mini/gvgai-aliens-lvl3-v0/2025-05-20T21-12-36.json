However, there may not be immediate targets in range based on the current sprite positions.\n\nConsidering defense and positioning, moving right to (10, 2) seems to be a strategic choice as it opens up more options for movement and keeps the avatar safe from immediate threats.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right is expected to avoid immediate threats and may potentially allow targeting at a subsequent action."
