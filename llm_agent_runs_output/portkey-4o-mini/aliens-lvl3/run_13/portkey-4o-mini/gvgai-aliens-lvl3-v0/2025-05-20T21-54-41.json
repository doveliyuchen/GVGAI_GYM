    "content": "Given the current state of the game, here's a breakdown of the available actions and considerations for your next move:\n\nYour avatar (indicated by 'a') is located at (10, 0), and there are several alien sprites ('@') present in the vicinity, particularly at rows above (1-4) and bombs ('&') positioned at (8, 1), (9, 1), and (9, 2). Your objective is to prevent these aliens from reaching your base ('#'), which is not specified in your current view but is generally to be defended.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- Your position: (10, 0).\n- Bomb threats at (8, 1), (9, 1), and (9, 2).\n- Multiple alien sprites in rows above (specifically at rows 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n- No immediate danger from aliens as they are higher up, but bombs may pose a risk if they are aimed lower.\n\n### Actions to Consider:\n1. **ACTION_USE (1)**: If you have any projectiles (SAMs) available, using them to target aliens would be a viable action. However, it's not clear if you have SAMs in your current state since they are not indicated in the map.\n   \n2. **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Moving left wouldn't help because there's no available movement that would change the state meaningfully. You would still be underneath the bomb threats.\n  \n3. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Similar to going left, moving right wouldn\u2019t change your scenario since there\u2019s no immediate alien in that direction that would threaten your base directly.\n\nSince your current position hasn\u2019t changed earlier and no alien is immediately threatening your base within your attack range, I suggest the most strategic action would be to use a SAM if available to target one of the visible alien sprites.\n\nHowever, since I will assume you have no SAMs or coherent immediate threats below your position, it would be best to simply **plot your next move carefully without encountering unnecessary risks**:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis assumes you are utilizing available SAMs to target aliens, in line with your strategy to eliminate threats before they reach your base. If I don't have a SAM, I'll adjust the decision based on my next state. Expectation: I should see a reduction in alien sprites as I defend against incoming threats adequately."
