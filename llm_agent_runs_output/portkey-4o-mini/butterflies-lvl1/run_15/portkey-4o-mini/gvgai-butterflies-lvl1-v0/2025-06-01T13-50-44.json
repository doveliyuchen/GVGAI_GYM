From the avatar's position, available movements are limited due to the surrounding walls.\n\n### Possible Movements and Actions:\n1.

The cocoon is at (1, 4) and (4, 24). \n\n### Analyzing the State:\n1. **Cocoon Status**: The cocoon must be protected, so I should avoid actions that would allow butterflies to reach the cocoon.\n2. **Butterflies**: I need to prioritize getting closer to butterflies in order to eliminate them.\n3. **Movement**: I need to check for walls and ensure I have a path to the nearest butterfly without putting the cocoon at risk.\n\n### Current Position:\nSince my avatar is at (9, 21) and the nearest butterfly in the row below me is at (5, 23). The closest possible action to eliminate butterflies while protecting the cocoon seems to be to move up.\n\n### Evaluating the Available Actions:\n- **ACTION_UP (to (8, 21))**: Move up to row 8, which is still away from the butterflies.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (to (10, 21))**: Move down which is safe but doesn't get closer to any butterflies.\n- **ACTION_LEFT (to (9, 20))**: Moving left is blocked by a wall at (9, 19).\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (to (9, 22))**: This is still away from any butterflies and doesn't aid in the game objective.\n\nThus, **the prudent action is to move UP to (8, 21)**. This keeps options open and helps in reaching higher rows toward the cluster of butterflies.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nTaking this action maintains the strategy of avoiding butterflies while positioning myself to eventually eliminate them. I expect to be in a better position to address threats to the cocoon and prioritize butterfly elimination in following turns."
