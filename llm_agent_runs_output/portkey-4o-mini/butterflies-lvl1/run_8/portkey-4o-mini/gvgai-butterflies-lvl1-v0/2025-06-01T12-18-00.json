The avatar can move up or down (8, 6, and 9, 7 respectively), but moving right or left is blocked by walls.\n3. The primary targets are the butterflies located above.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- **UP** (to (7, 7)): This space is clear ('.'), but does not lead closer to the butterflies.\n- **DOWN** (to (9, 7)): This space is clear ('.') but is further away vertically from any butterflies.\n- **LEFT** (to (8, 6)): This direction is clear ('.'), but it does not lead to any immediate advantages in terms of approaching the butterflies.\n- **RIGHT** (to (8, 8)): This direction is also clear ('.') but does not facilitate interaction with butterflies either.\n\n### Preferred Action:\nMoving **UP** (to (7, 7)) keeps advancing in the direction of the first column of butterflies while avoiding immediate threats from walls and creating potential pathways for the subsequent moves. \n\nThus, the chosen action is: \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of maximizing the butterfly count while moving strategically in the map.

Upon rotating, I can check if another directional action can be successfully executed in the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```   \nThis action involves moving right.

The two closest butterflies are located quite far above at row 2 and row 3 respectively.\n\nConsidering that the avatar's current position is (9, 11) and to balance between collecting butterflies and avoiding the destruction of cocoons, the best course of action is to move vertically upwards since there are collectible sprites (butterflies) above in the layout.\n\nThus, the action I will take is:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis upward movement intends to explore the upper rows where the butterflies are located, aligning with the strategy of maximizing butterfly collection while ensuring proper management of the cocoons. I expect to find myself closer to those butterflies after this action."
