Both are easily attainable.\n\nSince moving left won't lead to immediate actions toward collecting butterflies and there are no challenges to the right (due to walls), I should consider moving downward first as this leads to (7, 22) without any penalties, keeping my options open for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action aids in preserving my position near the butterflies while ensuring that I remain strategically flexible for the next moves.
