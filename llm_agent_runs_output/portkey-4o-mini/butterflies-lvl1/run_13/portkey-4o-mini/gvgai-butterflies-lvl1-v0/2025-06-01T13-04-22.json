In this case, moving towards the closest butterfly (to the left at (1, 15) or (1, 16)) is a priority. \n\nTaking the left path will allow for an immediate interaction with the butterfly at (1, 15), while moving right to (1, 21) might provide you with more options for interactions in future turns. However, there's also a risk associated with clustering, since more than one butterfly can be engaged at once.\n\nGiven the current position and the strategy, I will choose to move left towards (1, 17), to avoid interacting immediately with the butterfly at (1, 15) while positioning myself to engage one of the two butterflies at (1, 15) or (1, 16) on the next turn.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis left action keeps me close to the butterflies while avoiding an immediate collision, setting me up for the next turn to optimize my interactions."
