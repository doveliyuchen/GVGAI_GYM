This means the avatar must be cautious and avoid moving towards the butterfly or allowing it to get too close.\n2. **Cocoons**: There are cocoons (`#`) located at (1, 4), (1, 24), (5, 1), and (9, 4). Preserving the state of having no remaining cocoons is crucial for not losing the game.\n3. **Objective**: The ultimate goal is to eliminate all butterflies while avoiding being killed by them and ensuring that no cocoons remain.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The avatar should move in a direction away from the butterfly and towards a safer region where it can either assess further actions or start targeting butterflies.\n- Given the position of the avatar and the immediate danger presented by the butterfly at (6, 20), the most strategic action would be to move the avatar left (to column 0), away from the danger.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action is a left move, taking the avatar to (6, 0).

Focusing on butterflies while allowing cocoons to survive is not an optimal strategy.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince directly moving towards the butterflies may lead to collisions (and loss), we need to consider the layout. Testing movement options to avoid immediate threats while progressing towards either eliminating the butterflies or destroying both cocoons seems wise. \n\nGiven the current avatar's position at row 8 and column 2, let's first analyze the possible moves:\n\n- **UP (row 7, col 2):** This position is empty and allows movement without encountering a butterfly immediately.\n- **DOWN (row 9, col 2):** This position is empty as well, but moving down does not necessarily help in managing the butterflies or cocoons.\n- **LEFT (row 8, col 1):** This position is also empty and keeps distance from butterflies.\n- **RIGHT (row 8, col 3):** This direction leads into more empty spaces but doesn't direct us towards any objectives.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** is the best option as it allows the avatar to relocate to an open space while staying away from the immediate danger posed by the butterflies on lower rows. This may also result in opportunities to strategize on targeting the more distant butterflies and managing the cocoon situation next.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should maintain my safety while keeping options open for subsequent moves towards addressing the win condition."

You need to avoid colliding with any of them to prevent your avatar from being killed.\n\n2. **Cocoon Location**: There is a cocoon located at (9, 4), which means you'll lose if it remains alive. Therefore, you need to eliminate any nearby butterflies to access and destroy this cocoon. \n\n### Current Movements and Strategy:\n- Your immediate goal should be to either create space from the butterflies or eliminate them.\n- Since moving left (to (8, 3)) or right (to (8, 5)) does not provide any significant cover from butterflies and might lead to collisions, your best option may be to move up to (7, 4) if possible, giving you a chance to reposition.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action should help you to regroup further from potential collisions, analyze the next move based on the positions of the butterflies and cocoon, and continue advancing towards either killing butterflies or managing the cocoon threat effectively."

The cocoon at (9, 4) needs to be addressed to avoid immediate loss. \n- Butterflies are active, and there are several moving directly near areas where the cocoon is located.\n  \n### Strategy:\n- We need to prioritize avoiding butterflies while considering the cocoon. The avatar is currently positioned directly adjacent to a wall and should avoid moving closer to the access of the cocoon which could potentially attract butterflies into its position.\n\nTo best proceed with this scenario, an effective direction would be to move **up**, to (row 8, col 1) to confirm the safety of the area and avoid a direct encounter with any nearby butterflies.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is aimed at keeping safety from the butterflies while maintaining the strategic advantage over the cocoon's position."
