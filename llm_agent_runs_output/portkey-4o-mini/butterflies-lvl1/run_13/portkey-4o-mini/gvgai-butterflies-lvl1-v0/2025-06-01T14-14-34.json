I expect this aligns with my strategy of learning the level and managing scoring opportunities with careful movement."

The best action right now is to see if you can move towards the cocoon at (1, 24) or engage with the butterflies.\n2. The closest butterfly is at (1, 20).

With the cocoon at (1, 24), you can directly engage it to spawn a butterfly, but not losing track of how many butterflies exist is crucial.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince your position has not changed, and to address the nearby cocoon effectively, I will move to the right towards (1, 5) to position closer to the cocoon.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis movement is expected to optimize your position towards interacting with the cocoon in subsequent moves."

You need to move so that you can interact with the cocoon if possible, but currently, there is no immediate action you can take towards the cocoon as there are obstacles (walls) between you.\n\n2. The next strategic step is to explore the available paths in order to navigate towards a position where you can either manage the cocoon interactions effectively or start scoring from the butterflies.\n\nThe cells around your current position (6, 6) are as follows:\n- Up (5, 6) -> Empty (.)\n- Down (7, 6) -> Empty (.)\n- Left (6, 5) -> Empty (.)\n- Right (6, 7) -> Empty (.)\n\nYou can explore one of these options. Moving down or left keeps you in a position with open spaces for further navigation. \n\nI will move down which keeps the options open for subsequent movements to potentially get closer to interacting with a cocoon.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nMoving down allows for further exploration towards the next series of actions and fits the strategy of navigating towards potential cocoon interactions or butterfly scoring."

Therefore, while creating butterflies is necessary, we must be strategic about when to interact with them.\n- **Positioning:** The cocoon is quite far, meaning moving toward it may not be the immediate priority given the close presence of butterflies.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- With two butterflies adjacent to the avatar at (row=6, col=21) and (row=6, col=22), the immediate action should be to move left to position (row=6, col=6) since it also provides a clear way to revisit the cocoon at (row=1, col=24) later on without interacting with the butterflies just yet.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the analysis of the state and the available actions, the best action is: \n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action will allow for repositioning while keeping a safe distance from the butterflies for the time being, following the strategic suggestion to analyze before making an irreversible action."

I expect to see opportunities arise from this new position in the next move."
