The goal is to eliminate these butterflies while managing the cocoons ('#') effectively.\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n- There are several butterflies in proximity to the avatar, namely at (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 17), (1, 18), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 17), and (5, 7).\n- There are two cocoons located at (1, 4) and (9, 4).\n- The walls ('$') create a confined environment, limiting movement options.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the game's mechanics, the primary focus should be on eliminating butterflies that are close, as they can replicate. The actions I can take are limited to moving in the four cardinal directions.\n\n### Current Position: (6, 18)\n- The immediate surrounding of the avatar has walls to the north (6, 17) and south (6, 19), which limits movement.\n- East (6, 19) is clear, but does not lead to any beneficial interaction.\n- West (6, 17) is a wall ($).\n- Therefore, the potential moves to the right (6, 19) may not be the most effective as it leads to an empty space, and can lead to a situation where the avatar does not get closer to any of the butterflies.\n\nGiven that my last movement resulted in no position change and knowing that multiple butterflies are present to the north and onto upcoming rows, I need to take a more strategic approach.\n\n### Next Action:\nI will move **up** from my current position at (6, 18) to (5, 18), as this would open additional paths for interacting with more butterflies located at (4, 11) and (4, 12) should I position myself properly afterwards, or allow me an optimal position to continue upward.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up is expected to position me better toward the active butterflies without immediate backtracking into walls.
