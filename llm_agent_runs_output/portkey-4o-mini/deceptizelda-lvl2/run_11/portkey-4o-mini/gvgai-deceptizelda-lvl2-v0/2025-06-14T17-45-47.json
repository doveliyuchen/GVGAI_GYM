Directly adjacent to the avatar, there is a small goal ('&') at (10, 11) and an empty space at (10, 9).\n\n2. **Goal**: The immediate goal is to collect points by interacting with the small goal.\n\n3. **Available Actions**: The avatar can use the sword, and there is a nearby small goal that can be reached.\n\nSince the current position allows for engaging directly with the small goal at (10, 11), the best action is:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will use the sword to interact with the small goal, allowing the avatar to score points and advance in the game, aligning perfectly with the overall strategy focusing on collecting goals."

Since we are in the \"withkey\" state, we should prioritize reaching goals to gain points. The nearest available option is the small goal to the right (10, 11).\n\nTherefore, the logical action here is to move the avatar to the right to interact with the small goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right to interact with the small goal is a strategic choice to score points effectively."
