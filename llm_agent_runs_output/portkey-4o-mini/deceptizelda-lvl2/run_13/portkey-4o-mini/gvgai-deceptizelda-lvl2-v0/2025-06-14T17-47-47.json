Additionally, there is a point-scoring item (a vase 'v') that I could also collect for points. Various goals are present, with a small goal '&' located at (10, 11) and a large goal '#' at (8, 11).\n- **Obstacles**: The map is littered with walls ('w'), which will block most direct movements. The walls create paths that must be navigated carefully.\n\nGiven this information, my central action should be to move toward the key and the small goal at (10, 11) to gather points and increase my chances of winning.\n\nI will start by moving **RIGHT** from an assumed central position in row 10 (the nearest row to critical items) to collect the key.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action allows me to aim toward the key, and I hope to find myself positioned to collect the key on subsequent turns effectively."

The avatar also has access to a large goal (represented by '#') at (8, 11) and has defeated an enemy at (5, 3). \n\nGiven the current position, the strategy dictates that we should prioritize reaching the small goal, which can be accessed by moving right from (10, 10) to (10, 11). This would increase the count of the small goal sprites and contributes towards winning the game.\n\nSince the avatar is currently in the \"withkey\" state (indicated by 's'), we have the necessary item to approach and interact with the goals. \n\nTherefore, the most logical action to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action translates to moving right towards the small goal. It aligns well with the current strategy of focusing on goals and minimizing engagement with other enemies or obstacles."
