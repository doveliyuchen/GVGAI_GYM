This aligns with the overall game plan to collect points by achieving goals.\n\nSince I am currently at the position of the large goal and have the ability to interact with it as well, I should focus on taking action immediately. \n\n### Next Action:\nI should use the action to interact with the small goal (since the avatar is situated directly in front of it).\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nBy using this action, I aim to score points and potentially engage the next part of the game smoothly."
