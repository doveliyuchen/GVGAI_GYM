Judging by the current state:\n- Surrounding aliens can threaten your avatar, and there are not many immediate resources in your vicinity.\n- You need to prioritize avoiding bomb threats and possibly moving towards a supply to refresh your ammo.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Direction towards Supplies**: The closest supply of ammunition is at (0, 4).
