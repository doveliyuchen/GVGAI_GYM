Since we need to keep our ammunition up and the supply is readily available, I will move towards `(1, 15)`.\n2. **Movement:** I will choose to move down, assuming my avatar is initially facing towards the supplies.\n\n### Selecting Action:\nSince I'm moving to collect supplies in the `(1, 15)` position, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThis action should effectively direct my avatar toward the supply drop, allowing me to pick up valuable resources essential for defending the city and thereby enhancing my score potential. I expect this aligns with the strategy of resource management.
