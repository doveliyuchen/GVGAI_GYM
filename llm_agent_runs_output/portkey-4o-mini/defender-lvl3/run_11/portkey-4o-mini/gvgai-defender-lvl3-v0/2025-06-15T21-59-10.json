Since there are aliens at (row 2, col 9), (row 2, col 10), (row 2, col 20), and others around, moving to collect supplies while avoiding confrontation is key.\n\nThus, my action will be to move **up** to potentially collect the supply at (row 3, col 4).\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nMoving up will position me towards the supply and maintain an offensive posture against any aliens while also keeping an eye on the city's safety.

Collect supplies (if in proximity).\n2. Move to a safer location or reposition to take shots at aliens.\n\n**Current Strategy**\n- **Defensive Priority**: The primary goal is to protect the city, and there are no immediate threats directly affecting the city's status presently.\n- **Resources**: I need to ensure that ammo is constantly replenished since this will help manage any aliens trying to attack the city.\n\nSince there is an ammo supply at (0, 4) and (0, 15), I can consider moving in a strategic manner towards these supplies after ensuring my immediate safety.\n\nGiven the avatar\u2019s position doesn't change from the last state where it could take harm if not properly positioned, the next action should be a directional move.\n\nActioning for **left (2)** would redirect towards potential supplies, with an expectation that it would either connect with a supply or at least not jeopardize the city.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```  \nMoving left should help maintain a defensive position while potentially allowing access to supplies in the next moves."
