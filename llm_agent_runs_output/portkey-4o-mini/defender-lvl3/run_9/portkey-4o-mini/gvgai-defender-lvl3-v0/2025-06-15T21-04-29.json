We need to evaluate the surrounding tiles for threats and opportunities.\n2. **Nearby Enemies**: There are several aliens directly below the avatar at row 3 (the nearest being at (3, 1) and (3, 2)), which poses an immediate threat. We must prevent them from potentially attacking the city.\n3. **Supply Item**: There is a supply item ('&') at (1, 15) and also at (6, 15) that can be collected to sustain resources, which is crucial to manage ammo before engaging further enemies. \n4. **Strategic Planning**: According to the strategy, we should stay mobile, prioritize threats, and manage resources wisely.\n\n### Decision Making:\nGiven the close proximity of aliens, moving towards a supply might not be ideal if it means exposing myself to an alien attack. Therefore, moving up could be beneficial, as it may allow us to either reposition to engage or maintain a safe distance from threats.\n\n### Plan:\n- Move **UP** to (11, 4). This action keeps the avatar mobile while checking the situation above, allowing for a better strategic position to assess the area.\n\nThus, the action I will take is:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nFeedback: Moving up should provide a safer vantage point to evaluate the threats while keeping the avatar away from direct confrontation with nearby aliens."
