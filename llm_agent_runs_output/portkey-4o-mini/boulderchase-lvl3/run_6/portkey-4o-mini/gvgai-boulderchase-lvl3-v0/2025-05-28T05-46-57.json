The strategy dictates to maximize resource collection and navigate carefully. Since the avatar has not moved, I suggest making a **suggested movement** towards a path that could lead toward more exploration rather than rotating.\n\nGiven that the environment presents no immediate threats or additional resources nearby, the best course of action is to try expanding the exploration path **by moving downwards to the dirt** to evaluate the subsequent rows for further actions.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move down:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action allows more exploration opportunity on the next turn, aligning with the strategy to explore the environment better for diamond collections."

Since pushing a boulder can potentially lead to defeating or interacting with nearby enemies or gaining access to diamonds, this is a strategic move. \n\n### Chosen Action\nI will move **up** to interact with the boulder, setting myself up for further strategic plays or collection of diamonds in subsequent turns. \n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with my strategy of exploring and interacting with surrounding objects to create more advantageous situations for diamond collection and navigation through the level."
