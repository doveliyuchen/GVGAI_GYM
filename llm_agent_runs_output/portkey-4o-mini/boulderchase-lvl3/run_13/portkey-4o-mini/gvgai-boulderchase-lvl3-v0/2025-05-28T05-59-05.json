The immediate area around the avatar includes some obstacles and collectibles, as well as several sprites and potential enemy interaction opportunities.\n\nIn this context, the following analysis can be made:\n- There are no enemies immediately adjacent to the avatar, so we are currently in a safe position to explore.\n- The avatar can collect resources, specifically diamonds, which are located in the surrounding area, as well as push boulders, if applicable.\n- The primary focus should be on collecting diamonds while avoiding unnecessary risks.\n\n### Strategy Decision:\n- The current position of the avatar allows for movement without immediate threats. \n- The most strategic move seems to be to collect diamonds. Observing the map, there are diamonds to the left (considering moving to the left) and downwards from the avatar's position (at (11, 6)). Specifically, directly below at (12, 6) there is a background dirt which can provide a safe route toward exploring potential diamond areas, or at (11, 5) there is a nearby boulder.\n\nGiven the situation and the overall strategic plan of collecting resources, I will proceed to:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will move the avatar left to (11, 5), where I can explore further options without immediate risk."
