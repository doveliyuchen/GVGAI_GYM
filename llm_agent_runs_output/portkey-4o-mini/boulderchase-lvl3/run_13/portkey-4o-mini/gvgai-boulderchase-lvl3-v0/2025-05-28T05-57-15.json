To maximize the score while ensuring survival and a successful exit, it's essential to navigate carefully.\n\n### Immediate Objective:\n1. The avatar needs to collect fewer than 10 diamonds to reach the exit.\n2. Use the nearby boulders for strategic advantage against enemies if needed.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- The avatar can collect diamonds or make strategic movements. Since there are diamonds nearby, I should consider an action that allows for resource collection without exceeding the limit.\n\n### Next Action:\nMy current position is (11, 7), and I can see the following relevant surrounding squares:\n- (11, 6): Sword (can be useful if a combat encounter arises)\n- (11, 8): Collect another resource (or a hazard, depending on what lies there).\n\nTo evaluate the current approach and make a change, I would rather collect the sword first, as it aligns with the strategy to prepare for combat. Therefore, I should move left to collect the sword.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this action will be beneficial as acquiring the sword prepares my avatar for potential enemy confrontations while also allowing further movement options afterward."
