The strategy suggests focusing on resource collection while avoiding unnecessary combat.\n\nConsidering the avatar's position and the surroundings:\n1. The left action (to (9, 7)) puts the avatar adjacent to a crab. \n2. The right action (to (9, 9)) takes the avatar to an open space which allows for better positioning for further actions or collection. \n3. Up or down do not yield advantageous positioning instantly.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the **ACTION_RIGHT** to move to (9, 9), which keeps a safe distance from the crab and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \nI'm expecting this action to put my avatar in a more advantageous position to make subsequent moves without immediate combat."
