In this surrounding area, we have several important entities:\n\n- Diamonds ('*') are available at positions (3,5), (3,6), (3,20), (4,1), (4,18), (5,23), (5,24), (9,1), (9,2), (10,1), (10,2), and (10,19).\n- There are crabs ('&') nearby at positions (8,6) and (8,7).\n- There are walls ('d') surrounding some parts of the map, and the exit door ('e') needs to be reached with fewer than 9 diamonds.\n\nSince the avatar's current position has not changed from the last state, I will first analyze possible actions to take.\n\nHere, the immediate actions we can execute:\n1. **Left (2)** - This will move us to position (9,6), which is an empty space ('.').\n2. **Right (3)** - This will move us to position (9,8), which is also empty ('.').\n3. **Up (5)** - This will change our position to (8,7), which is a crab ('&'). We would likely face a loss here since we may be defeated.\n4. **Down (4)** - Moving down (to (10,7)) is also an empty space ('.').\n\nThe most strategic move is to either move left to (9,6) or right to (9,8) since they are empty spaces. Up is a poor choice as it directly interacts with a crab, likely resulting in immediate loss.\n\nI will choose to execute the **Left (2)** action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nFeedback: This action positions the avatar safely without encountering enemies, allowing for further exploration and diamond collection. I expect to evaluate the next steps based on the new position."

Given the surrounding layout, the optimal next action should prioritize safely navigating the environment and potentially collecting more diamonds, while avoiding direct enemy confrontation.\n\nThe available actions are:\n- **ACTION_LEFT (2)**: Would move to (9, 5) - empty space.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (3)**: Would move to (9, 7) - empty space.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (4)**: Would move to (10, 6) - diamond.\n- **ACTION_UP (5)**: Would move to (8, 6) - crab.\n\nSince moving up would directly lead to a crab, it's not safe. Moving down gets closer to a diamond, thus pursuing our primary goal of collecting diamonds while still staying safe.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best action is to go down where the diamond is located.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action is expected to be productive, as it allows the avatar to collect a diamond while maintaining safety from immediate threats."
