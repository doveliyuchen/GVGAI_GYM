    "content": "Given the current state, your avatar is located at (row=11, col=5). There are several strategic considerations based on the game mechanics and the current map layout.\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. **Enemies and Obstacles**: Nearby (specifically to the left, at (row=11, col=4)), there is a crab (symbol `$`), which is an enemy. This crab can potentially chase the avatar if movement is made towards it.\n2. **Resources**: At (row=11, col=9) there is a diamond (symbol `&`). This could be an appealing target for collecting resources, especially considering the win conditions regarding the exit door.\n3. **Safety and Navigation**: To the right (row=11, col=6) is a sword (symbol `s`), which may be advantageous in combat. However, protecting your current life count by avoiding unnecessary confrontations is vital, especially with an active enemy nearby.\n\n### Immediate Plan:\nGiven that your avatar\u2019s position hasn't changed yet, and to avoid getting too close to the crab which could result in losing a life, the best strategy is to move cautiously while still considering resource collection.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will opt to move **right** to (row=11, col=6) to see if obtaining the sword offers a combat advantage. This will also help in managing the crab safely by distancing from it for the moment.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right to potentially gather a sword for better combat options while keeping distance from the crab. I expect this action will aid in future enemy management and resource collection."

Our avatar is positioned at row 11 and column 6, and I need to determine a meaningful action to either collect resources or navigate towards the exit.\n\n### Observations:\n- The exit door ('e') is marked in the state description but did not appear on the map, suggesting we should focus on collecting resources first.\n- Nearby, I have spotted some diamonds (represented by '&') below me at row 12 columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n- There are walls ('c') surrounding those diamonds that I need to navigate around.\n- The boulders ('@') are also present, which I might be able to use against enemies if they come close.\n\n#### Previous Action Analysis:\nThe avatar's previous action did not change its position; therefore, I need to re-evaluate the next step to ensure it is strategic and conducive to my goal of resource collection while avoiding enemies.\n\n### Current Plan:\n1. **Collect Diamonds**: I will aim to move downwards towards the diamonds.\n2. **Avoid Enemies**: I will remain cautious and keep track of my surroundings to avoid enemies as I move.\n\n### Next Action:\nGiven my current position and the presence of multiple diamonds directly below, I will move down.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action allows me to move towards the diamonds, supporting my objective of resource collection while minimizing the risk of being caught by any enemies above. Let's see if this aligns with the strategy and observe my next position."

The immediate area shows multiple obstacles and resources, including some space that allows for potential movement and actions.\n\nSince the last action did not change your avatar's position, I will analyze the state again. I see that your current important goal is to collect diamonds and manage your resources effectively while avoiding enemies.\n\nFrom the current location, there are diamonds directly above (row 10, col 6) and left (row 11, col 5) of your position. Collecting these diamonds will increase your score.\n\nTo begin, I will attempt to move up to collect the diamond at (10, 6):\n\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to change the game's state by moving you to collect a diamond, increasing your resource count without exceeding the limit, and keeping safe from immediate threats."

The avatar is currently not holding any diamonds (as indicated in the state provided).\n\n#### Immediate Options:\n- Moving left (to (11, 5)) and right (to (11, 7)) will keep the avatar within safer background dirt tiles.\n- Moving down (to (12, 6)) will place the avatar on a crab, which could lead to a potential loss of life if the crab attacks.\n- Moving up (to (10, 6)) will also lead to an empty background tile.\n\n#### Best Action:\nGiven the current situation, moving to either the left or right is safe, but moving up to (10, 6) is the best option as it allows scouting the area further without immediate threat from enemies. \n\nTherefore, I will choose to move the avatar up.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nI expect this move will allow for further exploration without immediate danger, positioning the avatar in a safer zone for strategic decisions."
