The immediate surroundings include:\n\n- Enemies: \n  - A bat (`@`) at (5, 1) \n  - A spider (`%`) at (1, 18) \n  - Another bat (`@`) at (7, 7)\n  - A spider (`%`) at (5, 5)\n\n- Wall and wall-break elements:\n  - There are walls (`&`) scattered around.\n  - Several wall-breaks (`*`) are located at (2, 7), (2, 11), (3, 3), (3, 5), and others across the grid.\n  \n- The goal (`$`) is located at (6, 6).\n\n### Current Task\nThe goal is to clear a path to reach the goal (6, 6) while managing enemies effectively and maximizing points.\n\n### Analyze the Situation\n1. **Current Position**: (3, 9) - The bomberman is positioned such that there are walls to the left, below, and the right has an open area.\n2. **Objective**: Reach the goal and accumulate points by breaking walls and defeating enemies.\n\n### Next Move Strategy\n1. **Immediate Threat Management**: There are no immediate threats around the bomberman; thus, movement to either side or downward can be beneficial.\n2. **Path to Goal**: Moving south (down) to (4, 9) will allow movement towards (5, 6) which is also the row where the goal is located.\n3. **Wall-Breaks**: Should a wall break be necessary, the nearest is at (4, 6) but we need to reach (6, 6) first.\n\nFor the current action:\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\n### Explanation\nMoving down (ACTION_DOWN) to (4, 9) will help get closer to the goal while navigating through an open area. This aligns with our strategy of moving toward the goal while staying safe from enemies."

The immediate surroundings include walls, enemies (bats and spiders), and bombable walls.\n\nLooking specifically at my goal of reaching the green door at (6, 6), I need to navigate carefully, avoiding enemies and leveraging bombs to clear any obstacles.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- **Position**: I am at (3, 9).\n- **Nearby Elements**: \n  - Directly below me (4, 9) is an open space.\n  - Directly to my left (3, 8) is an open space.\n  - Two positions to my left (3, 7) is a spider.\n  - I also need to consider the wall on my right (3, 10).\n- **Goal**: I need to make my way towards the goal by potentially breaking walls.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. The first step is to move downward since there is an available space below, which may allow for additional moves toward the goal.\n2. I will take a more cautious approach before attacking or placing bombs until I assess the positions of enemies in the next step.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to move down.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis downward movement should help me create more space and provide a better overview of the tile layout below.

The walls to the left of the bomberman are primarily made up of open spaces '.,' and walls '&', providing opportunity to maneuver into a safer position while working toward destroying enclosures.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will move my avatar left (to (3, 8)), as this will bring me into a more optimal position to check my surroundings further, assess enemy movement, and plan wall demolition if necessary.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nTaking this action will allow for further positioning while assessing what's next for wall-breaking.

    "content": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current state laid out before us:\n\n- The bomberman is at position (3, 9) indicated by the sprite `#`.\n- We have an enemy bat at (2, 1) and a spider at (1, 18), both of which are important because they can potentially harm us if positioned incorrectly.\n- There are also wall break tiles (`*`) and a target goal tile (`$`) which we should aim to reach for scoring points.\n  \n### Observations:\n- The goal is at (6, 6), and it's directly accessible if we can navigate through walls which we can likely break down using strategically placed bombs.\n- Our immediate surroundings (3, 9) provides some movement options where we could potentially move up to interact with a wall or place a bomb to break through walls surrounding the path towards the goal, while keeping an eye on the enemies.\n\n### Suggested action:\n1. **Bomb Placement Consideration**: The wall break tiles (`*`) provide potential areas where placing a bomb could help clear a path.\n2. **Enemy Awareness**: There are two enemies nearby, so we must take care not to rush into their vicinity without having a bomb ready.\n\nGiven the immediate surroundings, the most optimal approach would be to explore alternatives to destroy walls blocking the path to our goal while avoiding danger.\n\n### Decision:\nSince the avatar hasn't moved since the last state, I'll first rotate towards an open space before exploring further options. Thus, I will move Left.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to help reposition the bomberman towards the adjacent wall, gearing up either for a strategic bomb placement or continued movement towards the goal area."
