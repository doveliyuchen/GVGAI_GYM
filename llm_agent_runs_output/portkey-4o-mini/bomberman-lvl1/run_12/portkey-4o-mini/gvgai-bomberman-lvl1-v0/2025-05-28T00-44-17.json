The spider at (1, 14) is also out of my current area of influence.\n3. **Immediate Best Action**: To progress towards the goal (6, 6), breaking nearby walls will offer potential routes, specifically below at (4, 9).\n\nGiven that I need to make my way down towards breaking through walls to access the goal directly below my avatar at (6, 6) later, the best action now is to place a bomb strategically below to break the wall.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to break the wall at (4, 9), opening a pathway to progress towards the goal in subsequent turns.
