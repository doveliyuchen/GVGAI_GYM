Using a bomb is a viable option, especially near (2, 10) to break down the wall and facilitate movement towards the goal.\n2. Additionally, moving in any direction might be less effective if it doesn't bring you closer to your goal or address immediate threats from enemies.\n\n### Decision:\nSince the position of your avatar hasn't changed from the last state, and taking action is preferable to remaining idle, I will choose to use a bomb to break the breakable wall at (2, 10). This action should create a new path for navigation toward the goal without harming yourself since you can retreat afterward.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nUsing a bomb at (2, 10) should allow for better path options toward the goal while also potentially removing threats posed by the adjacent enemies.
