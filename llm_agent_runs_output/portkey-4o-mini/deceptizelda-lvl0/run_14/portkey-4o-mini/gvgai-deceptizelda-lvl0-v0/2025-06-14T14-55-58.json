The avatar can access the nearby small goal at (10, 11) because it holds a key. \n2. Given that we are in a key-holding state ('withkey'), collecting the small goal first aligns with our scoring strategy and helps to accumulate points.\n\n### Expected Action\nI will move the avatar up to (10, 11) to collect the small goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThe action is to move upward to collect the small goal, which aligns with the strategy of accumulating points early in the game."

    "content": "To analyze the game state, we observe that the avatar, indicated as 'm' now has a key, allowing for access to small and large goals. The layout shows multiple enemies (denoted as '$') and several points of interest, specifically:\n\n- **Avatar Position:** (10, 10)\n- **Available Points:**\n  - Large goal at (8, 11), which provides more points upon access.\n  - Small goal at (10, 11), which can also score points.\n- **Enemies:** Located at (4, 7), (7, 3), and (7, 9), requiring caution before engagement.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the strategy outlined:\n1. **Key Management:** You're currently 'withkey', so you can attempt to unlock small or large goals.\n2. **Exploration:** The nearby goals are in access; the small goal is right next to you at (10, 11).\n3. **Avoiding Loss:** There are enemies in the area, so careful movement is advisable.\n\n### Action\nThe best immediate action is to go for the small goal at (10, 11) since it's right next to your current position. This should not only score a point but also potentially lead to further exploration.\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\n### Feedback\nThis action (moving RIGHT) should allow me to engage with the small goal directly while keeping an eye on enemy positions, thus aligning with the strategy of scoring points and exploring effectively."
