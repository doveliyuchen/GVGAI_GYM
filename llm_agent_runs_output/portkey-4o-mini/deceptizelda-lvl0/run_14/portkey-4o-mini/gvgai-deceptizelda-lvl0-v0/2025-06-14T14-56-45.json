Looking at available sprites, the nearby entities of interest include:\n\n- The sword (*) located at (10, 9)\n- The large goal (#) located at (8, 11)\n- The small goals (&) located at (10, 11)\n\n### Strategy Based on the Current Position\nSince the avatar is currently at (10, 10) with the key and a sword, the focus will be on progressing towards the immediate goal. The avatar's next step is to destroy the small goal ('&') at (10, 11). \n\n### Action Selection\nThe avatar can use the sword to interact with the small goal directly.\n\nThus, the action taken will be:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis action is expected to be effective as it aligns with the immediate goal of destroying the small goal and potentially increasing the score while advancing through the level."

    "content": "To begin, let's analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map:\n\nYour avatar '@' (marked as 'm' in some contexts because it is currently holding the key) is situated at (10, 10). It can interact with the large goal '#' at (8, 11) and the small goal '&' at (10, 11). A sword '*' is not present in the surroundings as the avatar is already with key, suggesting that the avatar can interact with goals. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar at (10, 10) has access to the large goal ('#') at (8, 11) by moving up and the small goal ('&') at (10, 11) directly to the right.\n2. **Immediate Goals**: Both goals can be accessed in this move sequence. However, the small goal ('&') is directly adjacent to the avatar\u2019s current position (to the right).\n3. **Strategic Move**: If the goal is to maximize the score, it is typically advantageous to complete goals first, especially if they are within reach.\n\nGiven the available interactions and strategic considerations, the most immediate action is to move to the right (to access the small goal).\n\n### Intended Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nI expect this action (moving right) to allow the avatar to collect points from the small goal immediately."
