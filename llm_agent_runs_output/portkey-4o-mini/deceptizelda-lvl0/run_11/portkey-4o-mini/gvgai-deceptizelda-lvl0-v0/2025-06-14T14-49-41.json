In this position, I have a sword and I am able to interact with a small goal located at row 10, column 11.\n- There are two potential types of goals: small goal ('&') that I can access right to my current position.\n- The key actions available to me include using my sword and moving in four possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).\n\n### Available Action\nSince I am currently adjacent to a small goal (at row 10, column 11), the logical action would be to **interact with it** in order to progress towards my scoring objectives.\n\n### Making a Move\nI will proceed with **ACTION_USE** to interact with the small goal.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow me to increase my score by interacting with the small goal right next to me, aligning with my strategy to maximize points effectively."

There is a small goal immediately to the right at (10, 11) (indicated by `&`). \n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n- **Using the sword** (`ACTION_USE`) has no immediate benefit since there is no enemy in close proximity.\n- **Moving left** (`ACTION_LEFT`) leads to position (10, 9), which is empty (`.`), but it would not progress towards scoring.\n- **Moving right** (`ACTION_RIGHT`) to (10, 11) would result in interacting with the small goal (`&`), which is the best immediate action since it will contribute to my score and help meet win conditions.\n- **Moving down/up** would also either lead to walls or remain on empty tiles.\n\nConsidering the immediate advantage of achieving a goal, I will:\n\n```Action:3```\n\nThis action should successfully interact with the small goal, maximizing points and progressing towards winning conditions and aligns perfectly with the strategy of securing smaller goals first."
