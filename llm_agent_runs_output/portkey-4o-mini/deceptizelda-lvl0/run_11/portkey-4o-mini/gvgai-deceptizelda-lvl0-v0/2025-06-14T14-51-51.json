However, the current state does not explicitly list the avatar's coordinates. For the sake of strategy, I will assume the avatar could be near the walls or empty spaces given the map layout.\n- **Objectives**: \n  - Collect keys to unlock goals (both smallgoals and largegoals).\n  - Defeat enemies to gain points.\n  - Reach goals to score points and progress through levels.\n\n### Nearby Key Locations\n- **Key ('@')** is located at (10, 10).\n- **Smallgoal ('&')** is located at (10, 11).\n- **Largegoal ('#')** is at (8, 11).\n- **Monsters ('$')** nearby at (3, 5) and (6, 5), which must be approached carefully to avoid losing points.\n\n### Available Actions\nConsidering the current state, the possible actions I can take are:\n- **ACTION_NIL (0)**: No change, does not help.\n- **ACTION_USE (1)**: Using items could be crucial if I have collected some.\n- **Directional Actions**: LEFT (2), RIGHT (3), DOWN (4), UP (5).\n\n### Interpreting Previous Action\nAssuming my last action was towards the direction of a wall or away from actively pursuing keys or goals, I will choose to move towards the key located at (10, 10). Given that I can't interact with walls and need to move to collect the key:\n\nI will proceed by moving **RIGHT (3)** if I am below or sidelong from the key, expecting the avatar to pivot accordingly if directly in front of he key's position.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to bring the avatar closer to the key, thus improving the chance to collect it in subsequent turns. It aligns with the strategy of prioritizing key collection before reaching goals."

Move towards the key to collect it, as keys are vital for unlocking goals. \n2. Directly approach the largegoal to secure points.\n\nTo take an effective approach, I will prioritize reaching the key at (10, 10) first as keys increase my capabilities to unlock more goals and may offer strategic advantages.\n\nTo do this, I will move down to (10, 1) from the initial position:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nMoving down will allow me closer access to the key and potentially set me up for collecting the smallgoal afterward.

Since they transform the player's state, I should prioritize collecting keys.\n  3. **Reach Goals**: The primary focus should be on reaching the largegoal as it yields the highest score.\n\n### Available Actions\n- Since the avatar might not have moved recently, employing a directional action is critical for exploration.\n- To utilize the strategy laid out, I should prioritize getting closer to the largest goal or collecting keys first.\n\n### Planned Action\n1.
