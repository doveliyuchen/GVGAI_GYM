Move **LEFT** to (8, 9) -> This would move you to an empty space.\n2. Move **RIGHT** to (8, 11) -> This would still move you to an empty space.\n3. Move **DOWN** to (9, 10) -> This would cause you to hit a wall ('&') which is not an option.\n4. Move **UP** to (7, 10) -> This would also move you to an empty space.\n\n### Decision Making\nThe suggested approach is to avoid keeping stationary and instead make a move to either (8, 9) or (8, 11) or (7, 10). Since there's very limited danger within those moves aside from potential walls or hazards, moving `LEFT` to (8, 9) allows for further movement opportunities.\n\n### Action Selected\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action should allow you to move effectively while avoiding hazards and prepares you for more movement options.
