The score relies on moving boulders into goals, and I also need to avoid situations that can reset or cause the avatar to encounter holes.\n3. Since we cannot allow the SpriteCounter to reach 0, I need to ensure that I take actions that either push boulders towards the goal or set up future moves without exposing myself to sharp penalties.\n\nIn the current state, the best action involves:\n\n1. Analyzing possible moves from my position:\n   - Up (to row 4, col 4): There's a '.' (empty space).\n   - Down (to row 6, col 4): Again a '.' (empty space).\n   - Left (to row 5, col 3): There's a '.' (empty space).\n   - Right (to row 5, col 5): There's a '.' (empty space).\n\nFrom the analysis, moving either up or down doesn't directly interact with other sprites. Moving left or right also leads to empty spaces. However, as a strategy to potentially set myself up for future moves, moving downwards (to row 6, col 4) seems the most strategic choice since it allows for flexibility in interacting with other boulders in adjacent rows.\n\nThus, my next action will be:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action will allow me to make progress while keeping options open. I expect that moving down will also provide a better view of the next potential moves with respect to the layout."

    "content": "To analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take, let\u2019s first identify key elements of the environment based on the provided sprite mapping and the current state.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n- **Avatar Position**: The avatar is at (3, 6).\n- **Nearby Objects**:\n  - (2, 2): Goal (@)\n  - (2, 9): Normal Boulder (%)\n  - (1, 4): Master Boulder ($)\n  - (1, 7): Hole (#)\n\n### Objective Assessment\n- The main goals include eliminating target boulders and avoiding holes. The player can manipulate the boulders to move them into the goal while managing the holes.\n- The avatar can encounter various complexities due to the box and boulder interactions on the grid.\n\n### Possible Actions\nConsidering the possible actions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), I will evaluate them based on where the avatar is positioned:\n\n1. **LEFT (Action 1)**: The avatar would attempt to move to (3, 5), which is not beneficial as it does not lead to the goal or any helpful interactions.\n2. **RIGHT (Action 2)**: The avatar would attempt to move to (3, 7), which is an empty space and does not help in achieving objectives.\n3. **UP (Action 4)**: The avatar would try to move to (2, 6), which is also an empty space \u2013 not advantageous.\n4. **DOWN (Action 3)**: The avatar would go to (4, 6), which again is an empty space.\n\n### Selected Action\nAmong the possible actions, no current immediate moves seem beneficial given the available interactions. However, the avatar should prioritize manipulating the boulders, particularly the one at (2, 9).\n\nSince the avatar position remains unchanged after any potential action (indicating a need for a rotation or further action), I will select **UP** to see if it allows me to reposition closer to the goal. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving UP gives an opportunity to reposition and re-evaluate feasible moves in the next state to reach the boulders or goal strategically."

My goal is to manipulate the boulders effectively to reach the objective.\n\nBased on the strategic advice, I should either move towards the normal boulder at `(2, 9)` to influence its state or navigate to check other available paths since nearby boxes or holes could affect further moves.\n\n### Action Plan\n1. First, I will move **right** to `(2, 7)`. This movement places me closer to the boulder at `(2, 9)` where I can interact with it next turn.\n\nI'll execute the action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right positions me better toward the normal boulder now that the path is clear, enabling further interaction in the next action."

Nearby sprites include a master boulder at (1, 4), which we can potentially move into a goal area for points, while avoiding the holes present at (1, 7) and (5, 5) to manage our score.\n\nGiven the current state of the game:\n- We have multiple points where we can potentially move boulders or boxes.\n- Since we need to avoid holes and manage score penalties, and the goal is in the vicinity, we must consider how to effectively navigate the layout.\n\nNow, I'll execute an action based on navigating toward the nearby master boulder.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar **up** to (1, 7), where a hole is located. I'm expecting to readjust my approach, as I would need to avoid this hole in subsequent actions to prevent score penalties while trying to manage other sprites effectively."
