Since I cannot move down (7, 5 is a hole), the preferable actions are to either move left to (6, 4) or right to (6, 6). However, moving left does not lead to productive gameplay as it keeps me further from other interacting elements since there are no manipulable objects in that direction. \n\nOn the other hand, moving right would keep options open to act in future turns involving either the box (6, 12) or normal boulder (2, 9). \n\nThus, I will move to the right.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis decision aligns with the strategy to keep options open while remaining cautious of potential hazards.
