The left and right actions are available, and since they won't cause a change to your position after one attempt, if the action does not successfully move you, you'll need to explore those directions further.\n\nGiven this layout, the most strategic move is to **move left**, as moving right won't take you out of your constraints but does allow you to explore options towards the goal on your next move.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nBy moving left, I expect to situate myself closer to the wall (8,7) and potentially open up new actions for the next turn."

The nearby important sprites are:\n\n- Normal boulders (%) at (2, 9), (3, 10), (5, 10)\n- Master boulder ($) at (8, 1)\n- Goals (@) at (2, 2) and (5, 10)\n- Holes (#) at (1, 7), (4, 14), and (7, 5)\n\nTo progress toward the objective of clearing target boulders and aiming for the goals, the avatar needs to execute strategic movements.\n\nFrom the avatar's position, moving up or down seems plausible, but the available actions (left/right/up/down) need to be carefully assessed as the goal is to push or interact with boulders.\n\n### Immediate Considerations:\n- The master boulder at (8, 1) is within reach, and pushing it will change its state.\n- The goal at (5, 10) is directly reachable from moving to (5, 10), which may also yield additional points depending on the number of interactions with normal boulders.\n\n### Choosing the Action:\nSince the primary goal is to clear target boulders, moving to (5, 10) would allow interaction with the normal boulder at (5, 10). The avatar can achieve this by moving **up** to (7, 6).\n\nThus, the best action at this moment appears to be:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to move up, clearing a path towards further interactions or achievement of the objective. I expect to see a potential interaction with boulders in the next steps, aligning with the overall strategy of using boulders effectively."
