This is a good move since it allows you to make progress toward one of the goals.\n2. **Right (8, 12):** This space is empty ('.'), which doesn\u2019t necessarily impede your progress, but doesn\u2019t assist in scoring either.\n3. **Up (7, 11):** This space is empty ('.'). Similar to the right move, it doesn't help progress.\n4. **Down (9, 11):** This space is also empty ('.').\n\nMoving left toward (8, 10) where there is a goal seems the most beneficial strategically since it allows you to progress toward the winning condition.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis action allows the avatar to move left and approach the goal, thus aligning with the strategy of making meaningful interactions to win the game."

Based on the surrounding sprites, it seems that the immediate surroundings contain walls, holes, and boxes, which can restrict movement. To strategize effectively, we need to analyze the space around the avatar:\n\n- Direct left (8, 9): empty floor (.)\n- Direct right (8, 11): empty floor (.)\n- Direct up (7, 10): empty floor (.)\n- Direct down (9, 10): wall (&)\n\nGiven that moving down is not an option due to the wall blocking that path while moving up, left, or right could keep the avatar in a secure position. However, since the previous avatar position hasn't changed (it is still at (8, 10)), we may need to try an action that moves the avatar to verify if it can simply rotate without changing the position.\n\nMoving **up (to 7,10)** seems to be the best strategy, as it leads to open space and maintains options for the next move. Here's the action I will take: \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to visualize potential pathways and examine the surroundings further while ensuring that the avatar can progress upward into an empty area. My expectation is to see that the avatar has moved up and can evaluate the next best action without getting blocked."
