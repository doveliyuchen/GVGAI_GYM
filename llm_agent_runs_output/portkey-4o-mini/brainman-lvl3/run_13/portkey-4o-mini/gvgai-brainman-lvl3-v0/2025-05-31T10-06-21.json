The green gem at (10, 6) is immediately next to the key, which needs to be avoided.\n3. There are no walls or boulders blocking direct movement to the key.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI will choose to **move right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to collect the key and avoid the gem. \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of effectively managing keys while avoiding harmful gems. Once I collect the key, I can plan my next move towards navigating the level further.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nCollecting the key will provide an advantageous position to progress toward the exit while keeping away from the dangerous gems."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the position of the avatar is at row 10 and column 4, denoted by 'a'. The primary goal is to avoid the colored gems to ensure the avatar's survival and to find a way to the exit.\n\nHere\u2019s what the important parts of the game state look like near the avatar's position:\n\n- Row 10: \n  - Column 4: avatar ('a')\n  - Column 5: key floor ('*')\n  - Column 6: green floor ('&')\n  - Column 7: blue floor ('@')\n\n### Analysis:\n- The avatar is currently on a key, which is beneficial. Collecting this key will allow for potential future access to doors.\n- Immediate movement options include moving up or left, but both directions have walls nearby. The key and green gem below can be avoided.\n- Moving right to column 5 (key) is beneficial because it allows the avatar to collect the key.\n\n### Strategic Action:\nThe best course of action is to move to collect the key at column 5.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to collect the key aligns with our strategy of effective key management, as it will enhance our ability to navigate through doors in the level."

    "content": "The current state of the game shows that the avatar (`a`) is positioned at coordinates (10, 4) on the map. Here is the surrounding area indicating potential movements:\n\n- The avatar is located on a `.` tile surrounded by various elements:\n  - To the left (10, 3) is a `.` (empty tile).\n  - To the right (10, 5) is a `w` (key missile, which is beneficial).\n  - Above (9, 4) is a `.` (empty tile).\n  - Below (11, 4) is a `d` (wall).\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n- The key missile (`w`) can be collected by moving to the right, which will be beneficial for interacting with obstacles.\n- We want to avoid any interactions with harmful gems while navigating toward the exit.\n- The immediate goal is to collect the key missile to expand our ability to interact with walls and doors.\n\nGiven the above layout and strategy, the best action is:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n  \nThis action moves the avatar right, allowing us to collect the key missile and enhance our gameplay capability. I expect this to align well with our strategy of effective key management."
