Move left (10, 1): This will lead to an empty space ('.').\n2. Move right (10, 3): This is also an empty space ('.').\n3. Move down (11, 2): This will lead to a wall ('d') and is unavailable.\n4. Move up (9, 2): This is an empty space ('.') and available.\n\nSince there are only two available directions that you can move (left to (10, 1) or up to (9, 2)), we'll analyze those options:\n\n- **Moving left (to (10, 1)):** While this is a viable option, it does not advance toward any collectibles or the exit efficiently.\n- **Moving up (to (9, 2)):** This is an open space and allows further movement potentially closer to the exit.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will choose to move up as it keeps advancing toward potentially collecting points and eventually reaching the exit without hitting any hazards.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to (9, 2), and I expect to explore further options from there."

The current location of the avatar allows for movement either left, right, or down since it is surrounded by open spaces ('.') above and on the left and right.\n2. The goal should be to collect the key and avoid the green gems that would eliminate the avatar.\n\nActions:\n- Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) to (row 9, col 2) is possible, but doesn't lead towards the goal of maximizing points.\n- Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) results in (row 9, col 4) which is also an empty space but remains stagnant for point scoring.\n- Moving down (ACTION_DOWN) to (row 10, col 3) allows us to stay clear of hazards and get closer to the key.\n- Moving up (ACTION_UP) would lead the avatar to (row 8, col 3), also clear but moves further away from the goal of collecting valuable items and the key.\n\nGiven this analysis, moving down (downwards to collect the key) seems to be the most strategic action.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to lead the avatar closer to the key, which is an essential item for solving the level effectively."
