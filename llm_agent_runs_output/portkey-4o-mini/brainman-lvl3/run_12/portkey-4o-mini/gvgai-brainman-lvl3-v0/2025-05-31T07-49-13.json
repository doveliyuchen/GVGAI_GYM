(empty space)\n- (11,4): 'd' (wall)\n- (10,3): '.' (empty space)\n- (10,5): '.' (empty space)\n\n### Immediate Analysis\nThe only movement options to avoid the walls would be to move left (to (10,3)) or right (to (10,5)). \n- Moving left seems safe as it leads to an empty space.\n- Moving right to (10,5) also leads to another empty space.\n- Moving up (to (9,4)) is blocked by walls, while moving down (to (11,4)) would also be blocked by walls.\n\nSince the objective is to explore and reach the exit while avoiding harmful gems, I will choose to move left to (10,3) since it does not lead to any immediate threats.\n\nThus, the action will be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should lead the avatar to a safe position, keeping in line with the strategy of avoiding destructive gems and maneuvering through the level effectively."

The goal (exit `%`) is at position `(1, 1)`, while there are several unblocked paths toward that direction.\n\n### Item and Interaction Consideration:\n- There are gems (green `&` which are dangerous if encountered), boulders (`#`), and the door (`$`) near `(1, 2)`.\n- Collecting keys would allow the avatar to eventually go through necessary doors (`$`) and possibly reach some gems for points; however, care should be taken with green gems and walls.\n\n### Strategy Based on the Rules:\n- As the avatar is currently at `(10, 3)`, moving to adjacent non-harmful tiles while planning a route towards the exit is key.\n- Avoiding `&` gems and utilizing keys strategically later is optimal. Since the direction south is blocked by a wall, I will explore the available paths.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the avatar can move up or right without encountering hazards and since the exit is far up the grid and to the left, the east at `(10, 4)` appears desirable. I will move right first.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action allows me to explore further in the direction toward the exit, and I expect to continue my progress safely without encountering any immediate threats."

The nearby items of interest include:\n- A key ('*') directly below at (row 10, col 2).\n- Two green gems ('&') and a red gem ('b') that can be deadly if encountered.\n- An exit ('%') available at (row 1, col 1), requiring the key or careful navigation past the gems.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe possible actions for the avatar are:\n- Move Left (col 7): This moves to an empty tile ('.').\n- Move Right (col 9): This remains empty ('.').\n- Move Down (col 8): This results in moving out of bounds (invalid).\n- Move Up (col 8): This moves into a wall (invalid).\n\n### Action Consideration\nThe only valid move where the avatar can progress safely would be to check the left or right positions. Going right seems to just lead further away towards a wall, thus should not be actionable as it yields no helpful outcome. The left movement (col 7) is actually the only advance.\n\n### Move Left\nGiven the analysis, moving left seems like a reasonable choice to avoid undesirable encounters and reposition the avatar safely.\n\nThus, I'm going to make the following action:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis left move will hopefully align our strategy by moving away from immediate threats and closer toward other areas of the map where the avatar can collect items and strategize further."
