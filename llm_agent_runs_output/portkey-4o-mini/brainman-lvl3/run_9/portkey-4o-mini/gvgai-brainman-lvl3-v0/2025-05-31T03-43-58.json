The surrounding grid contains various elements, including walls ('d'), open spaces ('.'), keys ('*'), green ('&'), blue ('@'), and red ('b') gems.\n\nGiven the rules and strategies, my goal is to maximize points while ensuring movement towards the exit. The immediate move options are limited due to walls, but the avatar can explore the area to collect items and maximize score potential.\n\nCurrently, the following options are available to the right and left of the avatar:\n- (10, 1) is an empty space (row=10, col=1).\n- (10, 3) is an empty space (row=10, col=3).\n\nSince there are no dangerous elements close to the avatar and the objective is to progress through the level while preparing for key collection, I will move left to (10, 1).\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nMoving left will allow for exploration of more spaces and possibly lead to finding a key or other worthwhile items while keeping safe distances from lethal elements."
