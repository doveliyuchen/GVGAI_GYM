The avatar should collect valuable items (red gems) while proceeding toward the exit.\n3. To effectively navigate, the avatar should focus on moving left or right as the next possible action, keeping in mind walls and hazards.\n\nBased on the current position of the avatar at (8, 10), the immediate adjacent blocks are:\n- (8, 9) \u2192 Empty (.)\n- (8, 11) \u2192 Empty (.)\n- (7, 10) \u2192 Empty (.)\n- (9, 10) \u2192 Empty (.)\n\nThe action should therefore be to move.
