The most adjacent move is to go up (row = 8 to 7), which keeps momentum toward the goal:\n\n``` Action: 5 ``` \n\nThis should bring the avatar closer to the goal, avoiding walls and water. I expect to see a continuous path to navigate toward the goal while managing any nearby hazards effectively."

The avatar (a) is currently located at Row 8, Column 8.\n\nFrom the layout, the goal (g) is located at Row 1, Column 9 (#). To reach the goal, I need to navigate through the level while avoiding any hazards such as water (.) and planning my moves effectively.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- My avatar is at (8, 8).\n- The direct path towards the goal at (1, 9) has water and walls that I need to circumvent.\n- There are several boxes (@) that I can potentially interact with, but I need to prioritize reaching the goal.\n\n### Actions:\n1. **Left Move** (to (8, 7)) - This direction does not bring me closer to the goal.\n2. **Right Move** (to (8, 9)) - This leads towards a pathway but does not bring me closer to the goal.\n3. **Down Move** (to (9, 8)) - This would work towards the lower pathways but keeps me distant from reaching the goal.\n4. **Up Move** (to (7, 8)) - This leads towards a box, but doesn't get me closer to the goal than my current position.\n\nBased on the available actions, and considering I must analyze the next steps since my avatar's position must change, my best option is to move **Up** to analyze the next row with the hope of discovering a path.\n\nThe **chosen action** is:\n``` \nAction: 5 \n```\nBy moving **Up**, I can evaluate the next row (7, 8) and see if I can find a more viable path towards the goal while avoiding hazards."
