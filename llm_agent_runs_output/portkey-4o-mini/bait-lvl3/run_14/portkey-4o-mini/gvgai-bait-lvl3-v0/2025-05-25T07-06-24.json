The avatar needs to prioritize getting to the key, and then subsequently to the goal.\n\nConsidering this, the next step can be:\n\n1. **Action**: Move the avatar to the right (ACTION_RIGHT).\n2. **Location Post-Move**: Moving right from (1, 2) to (1, 3) keeps the avatar on an empty floor ('.'), which is safe since it doesn't trigger any hazards or reset actions.\n\nThus, my action would be:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action should facilitate movement towards the right and allows for further progress towards collecting the key in future steps.

If the avatar is currently at (1,3), which is a '*' representing a 'nokey' state, I need to focus on moving towards the key at (9,11) which is '%' and avoid hazards.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible next moves: \n\n1. **If the avatar is at (1,3)**, moving to the **Right (1,4)** is open (.) then moving further right (1,5) is also open (.) will lead closer to the points of interest. \n\n2. **The move to collect the key** is also essential: Once the key is collected at position (9,11), the avatar can then change its state to interact with the goal.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will choose to move right from (1,3) to (1,4) as it does not lead to hazards and progresses towards potential key collection.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this action will keep the avatar safe and move it closer to key collection, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing collecting the key."
