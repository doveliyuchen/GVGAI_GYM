The avatar is currently on a nokey floor ('*') and there are no immediate hazards adjacent to it. \n2. Available movement options from the current position (1, 1):\n   - **Left (0, 1)**: Out of bounds (wall).\n   - **Right (1, 2)**: Open space ('.').\n   - **Down (2, 1)**: Open space ('.').\n   - **Up (0, 1)**: Out of bounds (wall).\n\n### Optimal Move:\n- To navigate towards the goal, I can move to the right to (1, 2) or down to (2, 1). Both options are viable; however, moving towards (1, 2) allows potential further navigation without immediate hazards, while moving down to (2, 1) opens up more options later on.\n\nGiven this analysis, I choose to move **Right** to (1, 2) since it maintains proximity to potential paths towards the key.\n\n```Action: 2```\n\nThis action is expected to bring me to (1, 2), where I can assess further options to progress towards the key and eventually reach the goal while avoiding hazards."

The avatar's current position is not indicated, so we need to infer some potential starting positions based on the layout.\n2. Key points of interest are the key (`%` located at (9, 11)) and the goal (`#` at (1, 11)).\n3. Walls (`b`) are surrounding the play area, creating boundaries that restrict movement.\n4. There are various hazards like holes (`$`) and mushrooms (`&`), which must be avoided.\n5. There are also boxes (`@`) that can be used for navigation but must be moved strategically.\n\nGiven that the objective is to collect the key and reach the goal while avoiding hazards, my expected strategy would be to move towards either the key or a box to facilitate movement without getting trapped by hazards.\n\nConsidering possible initial positions and actions:\n1. If I am close to box or a key, my next move should be towards them.\n2. Depending on the position, I can either move left, right, up, or down.\n\nStarting from a hypothetical position (let's say position (1, 1) - low-risk area) looking for a box or the key, I would likely take the following action if I had to make a choice:\n\n### Action Determination\nTo reach the goal (1, 11) and to navigate effectively, I should first prioritize finding the key. I can see multiple boxes (`@`) in proximity which might aid my movement strategy.\n\nLet's move towards a box to gain leverage for later moves. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves right towards an adjacent box (from (1,1) to (1,2)). I expect this to place me in a better position to move further towards the key while still tracking my route towards the goal."

Since the objective is to engage in strategic movement to navigate effectively:\n\n1. From the avatar's current position, there are no immediate hazards, so the avatar can safely explore.\n2. The key is located in row 9, col 11, which means the avatar needs to navigate downwards through the grid.\n3. However, carefully moving down should be prioritized because there are multiple boxes available on the lower rows (which can potentially assist in moving around obstacles once the player collects the key).\n\n### Suggested Action\nThe next most straightforward action is to attempt to move **downwards** as there is unobstructed space to occupy.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aims to move the avatar down from its current position and prepare to navigate further towards the key while avoiding hazards. After this action, the expectation is to verify the new position of the avatar and plan the next move from there."
