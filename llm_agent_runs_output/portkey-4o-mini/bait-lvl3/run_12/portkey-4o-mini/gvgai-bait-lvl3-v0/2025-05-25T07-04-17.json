The first action toward this goal must involve navigating safely away from walls and hazards.\n\n### Available Directions:\n1. **Left (0,1):** Moves to `(1, 1)`, which is a safe floor `('.')`.\n2. **Right (0,3):** Moves to `(1, 3)`, which is also a safe floor `('.')`.\n3. **Down (0,2):** Moves to `(2, 2)`, which is a box `'@'` and will allow bouncing.\n4. **Up (0,0):** This is not possible, as there is a wall.\n\nGiven the options, moving left or right seems safe, while moving down to the box allows for different navigation points as the boxes can be pushed or interacted with.\n\n### Choosing an Action:\nTo gather more favorable options, I will choose to move **Right** to `(1, 3)`.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI expect this action to place the avatar on the safe floor `'.'`, allowing further exploration towards gathering the key while avoiding hazards."

The avatar must navigate to row 9, column 11.\n2. **Avoid Hazards:** The avatar must ensure it doesn\u2019t collide with any holes or mushrooms on the way.\n\n### Move Selection:\nTo move towards the key at (9, 11), the avatar will need to navigate safely. Given its current position at (1, 3), moving down to row 2 or right may help. \n\nStarting with a direction that leads toward reaching the key while considering immediate hazards, I will need to be cautious.\n\nSince the area is vertically restricted with walls (b) surrounding it, the best initial action to approach the key is:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThe expectation is to successfully move down to (2, 3), leading towards further exploration towards the key while avoiding immediate hazards."
