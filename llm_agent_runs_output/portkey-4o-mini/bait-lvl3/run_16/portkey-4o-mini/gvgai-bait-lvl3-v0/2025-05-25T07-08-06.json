The direct path is blocked by several layers of obstacles, hence strategic movement is necessary.\n\n1. **Initial Move**: From (1, 1) to the right (2, 1), there is an obstacle ('.') making it possible to move to (1, 2).\n2. The path continues toward column (1, 3) without obstacles until reaching column (1, 6) which is a box ('@').\n3. Taking the right path would eventually lead to moving vertically or horizontally depending on obstacles until I can maneuver toward the key at (9, 11).\n\nSince the avatar's current position can move right without obstruction, I will choose the action to move there.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI expect to see the avatar move to (1, 2), allowing advancement toward the key while avoiding immediate hazards."
