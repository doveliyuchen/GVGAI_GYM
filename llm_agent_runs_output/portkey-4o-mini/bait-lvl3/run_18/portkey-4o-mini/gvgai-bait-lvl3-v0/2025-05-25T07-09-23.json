The avatar starts without a key, so the immediate task is to move towards the key while avoiding hazards such as holes and mushrooms.\n2. The closest key is located towards the bottom of the board, requiring careful navigation through the rows.\n\n### Action Planning:\nGiven that the avatar is on row 2 and the goal is at (1, 11) while the key is at (9, 11), the logical action is to navigate downwards considering the current position of the avatar.\n\nTo optimize movement, I will choose to move **downward** (to row 3).

Moving **up to (2, 1)** allows further movement options, while moving down to (4, 1) also keeps the options open for later turns. However, moving **up** will quickly get the avatar away from potential hazards surrounding row 3, and allows for exploration upwards where there are several boxes that could potentially be useful.\n\nThus, I will take the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis is the action of moving UP to (2, 1) which keeps the avatar safe while maintaining movement options towards the key. I expect this to align with the strategy to avoid immediate hazards and explore the area further."
