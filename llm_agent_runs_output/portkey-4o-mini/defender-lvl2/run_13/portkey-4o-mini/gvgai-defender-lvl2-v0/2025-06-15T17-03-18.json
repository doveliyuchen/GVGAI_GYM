Given that the avatar has not moved recently, collecting supplies should be a priority to enhance our ammunition.\n- Shooting aliens should be managed as well, but collecting supplies will ensure longer-term survivability.\n\n### Plan:\nSince the avatar is currently at (7, 5), I will move down to (8, 5) first to get closer to the supply at (6, 6), which ideally positions the avatar for the next action.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down towards the supply, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing resources and keeping the avatar moving."

The current state shows:\n- Immediate supplies are not within the direct vicinity, and the avatar is facing threats from multiple aliens.\n- Gathering bullets through supply pickups is crucial and the two immediate bombs near the avatar could be utilized to deal with aliens if positioned correctly.\n\n### Action Plan\nGiven that the avatar's position remains unchanged, a movement action is necessary. The planned course of action is to move either left or right to assess the situation and determine if there are any better options, keeping in mind the need to stay within reach of supplies and maintain mobility to dodge aliens.\n\nChoosing to move left (**ACTION_LEFT**) will bring the avatar closer to `(9,4)` which has a bomb, possibly allowing for an offensive action afterward.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action keeps the avatar mobile while hopefully positioning it closer to resources. It's expected to improve the avatar's ability to engage effectively with the threats while gathering supplies."

The nearest alien is at (4, 0) \u2014 meaning we are not currently under direct attack but must consider future threats.\n3. It appears the avatar has not moved since that would show a rotation state. Thus, acts of rotation must be accounted for.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince we haven't moved and must change position or take some meaningful action, a prudent step would be to approach the supply ('s') at (12, 6) that lies immediately below us in the direction which would allow us to collect resources.\n\nTherefore, the selected action is to move **down** towards the supply. \n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should facilitate collecting the important supply, bolstering our resources, and aligning with our strategy of maintaining resource management effectively."

There are several critical elements to consider:\n\n1. **Enemies (aliens)**: There are multiple aliens located around, specifically in rows 2 and 4, posing a threat.\n2. **Supply Drops**: There is a supply sprite 's' at row 12, column 6, which can help replenish ammo.\n3. **Bombs**: There are multiple bombs 'b' nearby (at row 3, row 4, and row 12), which can be useful for scoring points against the aliens.\n4. **City**: The city '@' is at row 12, column 13 and needs to be protected.\n\nGiven this layout, I should adjust my position to collect supplies while keeping an eye on the alien threats. The closest supply 's' is below my current location at (12, 6). \n\n### Action Plan\n1. Move down to position (8, 7).\n2. Next, I will head towards (9, 7) then (10, 7) and finally reach the supply at (12, 6) in a couple of steps.\n3. By collecting the supply, I will be able to maintain my ammo supply while also monitoring the position of the nearby aliens.\n\n**Action**: Moving down first, which might help to dodge any potential incoming threats while relocating towards the supply.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action helps in moving towards the supply and continues to keep the avatar mobile, adhering to the strategy of maintaining mobility while seeking resources."

I expect this will increase my resources while maintaining a safe position."
