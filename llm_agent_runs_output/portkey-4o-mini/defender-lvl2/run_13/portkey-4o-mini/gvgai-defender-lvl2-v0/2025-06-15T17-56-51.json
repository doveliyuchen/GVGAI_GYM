The first action should be to maneuver away from the aliens.\n\n### Selected Action\nMoving **left** (to (2, 2)) away from the aliens will allow the avatar to rotate and prepare to engage without being directly adjacent to a cluster of aliens.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nBy moving left, I expect to create distance from the immediate alien threat while maintaining the ability to shoot if necessary."

Moving right or up won't yield a safe result, as there are more aliens in those directions. Moving down (5, 2) could position your avatar away from immediate threats.\n3. **Collect Resources**: There is a bomb (b), and if approached correctly in later states, could be used to assist in defense against aliens.\n\nSince the avatar does not need to collect weapons yet and a direct path to the aliens is risky, the best immediate action is to move **down** to create space and access any remaining options in the future while maintaining a buffer from these threats.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action allows your avatar to reposition safely and avoid direct confrontation while looking for a strategic advantage.

Additionally, there are bombs '*' in row 4 that could explode and damage the avatar and the city if I'm not vigilant.\n\nGiven that the avatar has the ability to shoot at aliens and can collect supplies to manage bullets, it may be beneficial to assess the nearest collectible while keeping in mind the position of the aliens.\n\n### Current Position of the Avatar\nThe avatar is currently at (row 9, col 1) and has recently not moved. Thus, to make progress, I need to reassess the surroundings and decide on an action that either:\n- Moves towards a collectible (like the supply 'c' at (0, 4)).\n- Engages nearby threats such as aliens.\n\nGiven the strategies I was provided, prioritizing resource management is critical. Though there are alien threats, it's more strategic to deliver consistent shots to manage supplies effectively.\n\n### Next Action Decision\nTo increase the likelihood of survival, I should move closer to the alien threats to engage them, while also keeping in mind the timeline for the level. However, due to the presence of walls and layout, I might consider moving right towards (row 9, col 2), which keeps the potential for further actions in the following turns. \n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving right should position the avatar better for strategic options in the subsequent turns, allowing for possible engagement with nearby aliens or the collection of resources."

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the actions I should take, considering the proximity of the aliens and the need to defend the city:\n\n### Current Analysis\n1. **Avatar Position (8, 2)**: My avatar is relatively safe for the moment but close to several aliens located at (4, 1), (4, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 5) which could pose a threat if not dealt with quickly.\n\n2. **Aliens**: They are present in rows 2 and 4, and the closest ones are in rows higher than mine, meaning they could potentially move down towards the city. It's crucial to take action against them.\n\n3. **Strategy Application**: Following the provided strategies, particularly focusing on eliminating closer and more dangerous aliens first and managing resources (which includes keeping bullets), is essential.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince my avatar is at (8, 2) and directly shooting at an alien seems optimal, I take the action of moving left to (8, 1) to position myself better against the threats.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will not only shift my location one space left but also rotate the avatar directly to face an approaching alien threat effectively and ensure I'm positioned for my next attack or defensive move. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy of utilizing walls to provide a defensive position and potentially preparing for an attack on nearby aliens as necessary."

However, we're relatively close to some aliens; therefore, we should first focus on positioning ourselves effectively to shoot at the aliens and avoid being overwhelmed.\n- **Shooting Aliens**: Given the potential threat from the aliens, an immediate action could involve shooting at the aliens, particularly those that are close to us (around rows 4 and 5). \n\n### Selected Action\n\nTo follow the strategy and effectively respond to the threats posed by the surrounding aliens, we should first rotate our avatar towards the direction where the most immediate colors (aliens) are presented. The key here is to ensure that we take an action that allows for both movement and shooting where necessary.\n\nHowever, since we need to check if our position remains unchanged after an action, I will first move left to avoid rotation without moving and ensure we aim correctly at aliens.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action expects the avatar to rotate left towards the aliens, allowing us to prepare for shooting subsequently and avoiding any immediate threat from the closest aliens."

The aliens below the avatar are a direct threat, especially since they can move upward and reach the avatar or the city.\n2. The resources, like the portal ammo `#` and others (e.g., bullets) are available in the vicinity at (0, 4) and (0, 6) respectively, but they are far from the avatar.\n3. Movement directly right to (3, 2) is safe, but it does not decrease the immediate threat of the aliens.\n4. The priority should be to either collect ammo or deal with the nearby threats effectively. Since moving right will not engage the aliens and considering the ability to engage from a distance, shooting seems the best option.\n\nWith the threat directly below and to cover, the decision will be to take action against the aliens first. \n\n### Immediate Action:\nI will choose to shoot towards the aliens below.\n\n``` Action: ACTION_USE ```\nThis action is meant to engage and shoot aliens directly below at (4, 1) and (4, 2). Engaging them is crucial to protect both myself and the city. I expect to either reduce the number of aliens or get closer to obtaining vital resources next turn."

Consider using the action ACTION_USE to create space or disengage. However, the immediate surroundings are such that there are already threats nearby.\n  \n2. Moving toward the supply item might improve the situation by gathering necessary resources, although it would position the avatar potentially closer to multiple aliens.\n\n3. **Rotational Mechanics**: Since no specific action has been taken yet, and according to the mechanics, if I rotate, I need to ensure I can later move effectively.\n\n### Conclusion for Action\nI will move the avatar slightly down from its position to (4, 1), since going down seems to have fewer immediate threats. This also positions me closer to areas I might need to explore in the future. Therefore, I will select:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is expected to allow room to maneuver away from immediate threats while also positioning to potentially gather supplies on future turns."
