From the map, it seems that your immediate environment consists of nearby alien enemies ('&'), some destructible objects ('.'), and a few supply objects ('c').\n\nHere\u2019s what I suggest based on the strategy:\n\n- **Immediate Threat:** There are multiple alien enemies on row 2 and row 4, and you need to deal with them to keep your city safe. Avoiding the bombs ('s' or 'b') is crucial as they'll damage the city.\n\n- **Supplies:** You have nearby supply sprites (represented by 'c') that can help replenish your ammunition. It's vital to collect them to ensure you can keep shooting.\n\n- **Avatar Positioning:** Your avatar is on row 8, and moving up would put you closer to the supplies located at (7, 5) and (8, 5), allowing you to potentially collect them while keeping an eye on the enemies.\n\nSince your primary goal is to survive while collecting resources, I recommend moving left to position yourself closer to the closest supply (7, 5).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis leftward move will help you retrieve ammunition and engage with any alien threats looming ahead, which aligns with the strategy of resource management and offensive positioning."

Prioritizing the immediate threats is critical.\n  \n2. **Action Selection**: Considering the number of aliens nearby and your current ammunition level (which is not specified, but it will be important to check if you have enough ammo before acting), my suggestion would be to take offensive action. Aiming to shoot at an alien could be a beneficial move since there are multiple threats in close proximity.\n\n3. **Action Execution**: Since your position hasn't changed from the previous state, I would suggest first moving into a position where you can start shooting at the nearest alien threats. Moving to the right (ACTION_RIGHT) would allow you to target the alien at (2, 1).\n\nThus, I will proceed with the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action moves you closer to the immediate threat of aliens and allows for a better shooting position next turn. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy of prioritizing targets while also managing the risks from nearby aliens."
