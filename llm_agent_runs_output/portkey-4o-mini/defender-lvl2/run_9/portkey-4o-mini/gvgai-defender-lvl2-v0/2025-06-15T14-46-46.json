I should prioritize collecting supplies to ensure I do not run out of bullets.\n\nSince my avatar's last state involved a possible rotation (the potential need for movement in a new direction wasn't defined), I will perform a downward movement to try and engage the supply to the left.\n\n```Action: 4```\n\nThis movement is aimed at placing my avatar in a better position to collect the supply while also keeping an eye on alien activity nearby. I expect that gathering this supply will help maintain my bullet resources, keeping me effective in defense while I monitor potential threats from the aliens."
