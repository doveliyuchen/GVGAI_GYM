This can be used to shield against death.\n- **To the right (5, 8)** is a wall (`w`) which blocks further movement that direction.\n- **Down (6, 7)** is safe, as there are only walls below.\n- **Up (4, 7)** has boxes (`@`) but also walls surrounding them.\n\n### Strategy Application\nGiven that moving left could allow us to utilize the smoke for protection against potential hazards, it might be wise to first interact with this smoke.\n\nSince the avatar position remains the same and current mechanics indicate a need for movement or proximity assessments, a directional action to utilize the smoke is sensible. \n\n### Action Selection\nFollowing the strategic plan to navigate and utilize available resources wisely, I will proceed by moving left towards the smoke, preparing for future maneuvers to obtain the key or reach the exit.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nFeedback: Moving left to the smoke spawn allows me to gather a shield against obstacles, strategically improving my position for the next moves.
