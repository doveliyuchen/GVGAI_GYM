However, the smokespawn to the left could be utilized strategically.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nSince the avatar's position does not change, I will use the available action to use the smokespawn effectively. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should activate the smokespawn, providing a protective effect against the death sprite and possibly clears a path for future movements. I expect this aligns with the strategy of prioritizing survival and utilizing available resources."
