However, rotating might be necessary if the avatar doesn't move. \n3. **NPCs**: There are multiple 'quiet' NPCs to potentially manipulate up in rows 1 and 2. \n\n### Goal\n- The objective is to avoid aggression (such as killing 'george') while ensuring to transform 'annoyed' NPCs into 'quiet' ones for strategic advantage. \n\n### Next Action\nConsidering you are currently at (5, 9) and 'george' is directly below you at (7, 18) \u2014 moving upwards seems like a viable option to maintain distance from 'george', while keeping in mind to observe the possibility of transforming an NPC next turn.\n\nI will choose to move up to (4, 9) first, assessing how this impacts both the NPCs and your position relative to 'george'.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis keeps your avatar away from immediate danger, while also positioning you to observe the next possible actions with NPCs."

There are no immediate 'annoyed' NPCs visible.\n2. **Obstacle and Enemies**: The character 'george' (@) is present in two locations: (7,18), (7,19) and (8,18), (8,19). You need to avoid these areas to prevent losing points and being detected.\n3. **Walls**: The walls ($) surround the play area, and motion should be cautious due to the potential obstacles they present.\n\n### Current Strategy\nGiven the strategy discussed:\n\n1. **Stealth Navigation**: Avoid areas around 'george' to prevent point deductions.\n2. **NPC Manipulation**: Although not much can be done with 'quiet' NPCs at the moment, getting closer to them could be beneficial if other actions or transformations become available.\n3. **Movement**: Since your position is critical, it's recommended to explore viable paths towards areas where you can potentially manipulate NPCs while dodging interactions with 'george'.\n\n### Decision\nYour current position does not change after moving as an indication of needing to rotate or change direction. Moves towards positions with walls directly adjacent (e.g., upwards to (3,9)) lead to more complex rotations with walls.\n\nGiven there is space above your current location and fewer immediate threats, let's progress **UP** towards (3, 9):\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis move should provide more options for observing and interacting with the NPCs or avoid detection from 'george', while maintaining some distance from existing threats."
