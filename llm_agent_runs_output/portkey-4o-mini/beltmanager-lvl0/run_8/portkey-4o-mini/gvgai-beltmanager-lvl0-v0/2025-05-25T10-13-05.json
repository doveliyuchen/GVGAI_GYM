There are also death sprites ('%') that must be avoided. The player needs to manage the suitcase ('$') effectively.\n3. **Map Observations**: Rows with multiple '@' sprites indicate potential conveyor belts that can facilitate movement. The presence of 'l' (passenger) at (8, 30) indicates a target.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the above observations, the closest goal is the passenger ('l') located at (8, 30). However, moving directly toward the passenger requires navigating through columns filled with walls and interactive elements. \n\n#### Proposed Action\n1. **Action Right**: Starting from (8, 1), moving right (to (8, 2)) gets the avatar closer to the passenger while also avoiding immediate threats.

There are several immediate surroundings to consider:\n\n- Below my avatar at (row=9, col=3) is a wall ('.'), and above it at (row=7, col=3) is also a wall ('.').\n- To the left (row=8, col=2) is a lever ('*'), and to the right (row=8, col=4) is a passenger ('p').\n  \nSince I need to interact with the lever or move towards the passenger, taking into consideration the mechanics of the lever and the arrangement of the objects near me is crucial. Interacting with the lever can change the state of nearby joints or pathways, potentially providing an advantageous route for the suitcase.\n\nSince the last action did not change my position, I should focus on a meaningful action that can move me towards leveraging my options better.\n\nI will move **LEFT** to interact with the lever:\n\n``` \nAction:1\n```\n\nThis action aims to check if interacting with the lever results in any beneficial state changes that can help in maneuvering the suitcase or collecting passengers efficiently."

    "content": "To analyze your current situation in the game and to devise a strategy that aligns with the overall objectives, I can see that your avatar, denoted by 'a', is currently located at (row=8, col=2). \n\nHere's a breakdown of your immediate surroundings:\n\n- **Surrounding Elements**:\n  - Above your position (row=7, col=2): 'd' (lever Up)\n  - Below your position (row=9, col=2): '&' (lever Down)\n  - Left of your position (row=8, col=1): '.' (empty space)\n  - Right of your position (row=8, col=3): 'b' (lever Right)\n\nSince lever interactions can change pathways or blockages in the level layout, a prudent action would be to interact with one of these levers to alter the arrangement of sprites favorably for your objectives.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nConsidering your proximity to the levers, I suggest the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n(This action indicates moving Right to the lever on the right.)\n\nThis action will allow you to interact with the lever, which may pivot the connected joint sprite to open pathways conducive to moving the suitcase towards passengers. Aligning with the strategy, this creates opportunities for collecting passengers while minimizing risks associated with walls and hazards."

    "content": "The avatar is currently located at (row=8, col=3). Here\u2019s the relevant surroundings:\n\n- **Left (row=8, col=2)**: *\n- **Right (row=8, col=4)**: p\n- **Up (row=7, col=3)**: p\n- **Down (row=9, col=3)**: p\n\n### Analysis:\nThe avatar is surrounded by walls (on the left) and pathways (right, up, and down). Moving left is not possible due to the wall. Moving either right or down seems to keep the avatar within the boundary while moving up leads to another empty space. No passengers or critical items are nearby.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the previous position has not changed, I need to analyze where to move. The action to move right (to (row=8, col=4)) appears to be a better option than going down because it opens further exploration options towards other entities. \n\n### Decision:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nI expect this action to allow the avatar to advance in the game and potentially find more passengers or levers to manipulate the game state, aligning with the strategic planning for maximizing scores."
