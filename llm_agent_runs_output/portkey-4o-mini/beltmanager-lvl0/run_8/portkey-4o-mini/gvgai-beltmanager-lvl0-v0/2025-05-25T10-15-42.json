There are several important objects around me, including walls ('p'), belts ('@'), levers ('*', '&', 'b', 'd'), and death zones ('%'). \n\nGiven that I can either move left, right, down, or up, I will examine my options based on the immediate surroundings:\n\n- **Left (8, 0):** This is a wall ('p'). I cannot move here.\n- **Right (8, 2):** This is free space ('.'). Moving here is possible.\n- **Down (9, 1):** This is a wall ('p'). I cannot move here.\n- **Up (7, 1):** This is also free space ('.'). Moving here is possible.\n\nSince moving to the right (8, 2) is achievable, I will perform that action. This will open up new opportunities to interact with nearby objects and possibly manipulate the environment for the suitcases.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving to the right seems beneficial as it allows better access to more free spaces and potentially assists in moving suitcases effectively."

The surrounding environment consists of a combination of pathways, passengers, levers, and various other sprites.\n\n### Analysis of Situation:\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar (8,2):\n  - Immediately to the left (8,1) is '*', a lever that could potentially change the state of the environment.\n  - Immediately to the right (8,3) is 'b', another lever.\n  - Below (9,2) is '&', which is also a lever.\n  \nThe objective is to utilize these levers to navigate the suitcases to the passengers while avoiding obstacles.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n1. Since the avatar position has not changed since the last action, a new action must be assessed that can lead to a meaningful change. \n2. It seems beneficial to interact with the lever on the left at (8,1) to possibly alter nearby conveyance like belts or joints related to transporting the suitcase which will later help to deliver it to passengers.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` Action:1 ```\nFeedback: By interacting with the lever on the left, I expect to change the configuration of the area, enabling movement options for delivering the suitcases to the passengers.
