    "content": "The current state positions the avatar at (8, 3), surrounded by various elements including levers, walls, suitcases, and passengers. \n\nGiven that the avatar's last action likely involved a lateral motion (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), if the avatar position did not change, it may have simply rotated without moving. The next action should aim to interact with the available elements to either clear a path or score points through manipulation.\n\nIn the current state analysis, the following observations can be made:\n- To the left (8, 2) is a lever, which may help manipulate sprite movements if engaged. \n- On the right (8, 4) is a passenger, which can be beneficial to collect.\n- Directly in front (7, 3) is a wall, which would block any attempt to move up.\n\nConsidering these elements, it is strategic to first rotate toward the lever at (8, 2) by moving left. Engaging with the lever could alter the environment, potentially opening paths for the suitcases or affecting neighbouring levers.\n\nThus, I'll proceed with the action to move left to engage the lever.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nThis action should allow me to interact with the lever and potentially create opportunities for suitcase movement toward the passenger, increasing my chances of scoring without hitting walls or death sprites."

    "content": "To determine the best action based on the current game state, let's first identify the position of the avatar and its immediate surroundings.\n\n### Avatar Position\nThe avatar ('a') is currently positioned at:\n- Row: 8\n- Column: 2\n\n### Surrounding Environment\nIn the adjacent cells around the avatar:\n- Row 8, Column 1: '*'\n- Row 8, Column 3: 'b' (leverRight)\n- Row 7, Column 2: 'd' (leverUp)\n- Row 9, Column 2: '&' (leverDown)\n\nFrom this position, the avatar can interact with the levers to manipulate the joints, but there's no immediate danger in the vicinity since the walls (%) are spaced out.\n\n### Available Actions\n- ACTION_LEFT (1): Move left to (8, 1) - would land on a lever.\n- ACTION_RIGHT (2): Move right to (8, 3) - would land on another lever.\n- ACTION_DOWN (3): Move down to (9, 2) - would land on a lever.\n- ACTION_UP (4): Move up to (7, 2) - would land on a lever.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position does not change from its last state and the strategy emphasizes identifying interactions, I will proceed to **ACTION_RIGHT (2)** to engage with the lever in the adjacent right cell.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nBy moving right to (8, 3), I will activate the right lever, which may rotate or reorient nearby joint belts. This could help in establishing a further path for collecting passengers or managing the suitcases. It's essential as it aligns with the strategy of changing the state of sprites to facilitate future actions.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should allow us to manipulate the environment further and create opportunities for successful moves in subsequent turns. I expect to see a rotation or change in the joint states that will aid in our strategy to collect passengers."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the position of the avatar ('a') is at (8, 3). Nearby entities include:\n\n- Death sprites (\u2018%\u2019) are located at (6, 8) and (8, 22), which I must avoid.\n- There are passengers ('l') at (8, 30) and other interactive elements such as levers ('*' at (8, 1) and '&' at (9, 2)) and suitcases ('$') nearby.\n\n### Analysis\nThe avatar has not moved since the last state; therefore, it is important to choose an action that will change my position or interaction rather than simply rotating without any movement.\n\n### Strategy\n1. Moving towards the left to interact with the lever at (8, 1) could potentially allow manipulation of other spatial elements, creating pathways or affecting joints to align suitcases effectively towards passengers.\n2. Collecting passengers is a priority, but first, I should manipulate the environment if necessary.\n\n### Action Decision\nSince my avatar is currently facing down and I need to move towards the left to interact with the lever, I will choose to take the action that moves left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action should allow me to interact with the lever, helping to further manipulate the environment for future moves or to collect the passenger effectively."

Your current actions or movements should focus on either moving left, right, up, or down.\n2. Notably, there are belts (which may potentially influence the movement of suitcases) and walls surrounding your avatar.\n\n### Proposed Action\nFrom your current position (8, 2), you could attempt to move right (to (8, 3)). \n\n#### Action Selection:\nChoosing to move right will provide you with visibility of the environment to the right, and potentially allow for better alignment with the passenger located at (8, 30).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action allows for a strategic approach, letting you reassess your position once you have moved, while keeping in mind the goal of collecting passengers by manipulating suitcases nearby."
