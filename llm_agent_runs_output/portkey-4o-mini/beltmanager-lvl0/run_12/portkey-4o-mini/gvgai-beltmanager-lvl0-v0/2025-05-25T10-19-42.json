Finding and utilizing levers first may allow you to create pathways toward passengers without being blocked by walls.\n3. **Maximizing Distance:** Given the hazards and nearby items, ensure safety first before attempting to gather passengers unless a clear route presents itself after any transformation.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince your current action will not yield movement to the predefined right or left due to walls and there is potential up or down that can eventually lead to travelers or avoid wall encounters. \n\nSince moving left (column=1) potentially opens up more exploration toward available levers and avoiding immediate hazards, I'll choose:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action hopes to free up potential paths towards the suitcases while also keeping the surrounding dynamics in check in anticipation of what follows next."
