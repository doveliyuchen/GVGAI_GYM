Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n- **Surrounding Entities**:\n  - Up (row 7, col 2): leverUp ('d')\n  - Down (row 9, col 2): leverDown ('&')\n  - Left (row 8, col 1): empty (.)\n  - Right (row 8, col 3): leverRight ('b')\n\n### Strategy Review:\n1. **Understanding Surroundings**: The levers present (up and down) should be manipulated to help navigate the environment, assuming they toggle joints or similar mechanics.\n2. **Focus on Objectives**: The goal is to maneuver the suitcase ($) into contact with passengers (l). Currently, there is a suitcase visible to the south at (row 3, col 1 & 2), and several passengers further down the columns.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **Left (Action 1)**: This won't lead anywhere since it's empty.\n2. **Right (Action 2)**: This would rotate towards the lever, allowing potential interaction.\n3. **Down (Action 3)**: You can pull leverDown ('&'), which might affect your pathway but won't move you immediately.\n4. **Up (Action 4)**: Moving up to the leverUp may similarly allow for control of joints but is not immediately beneficial with the current positioning of the suitcase.\n\nSince activating a lever can rotate or otherwise affect the joint mechanisms, the preferred action is to manipulate the environment. \n\n### Decision:\nGiven that your avatar is currently at (8, 2) and considering the immediate interactions, I recommend you move**right (Action 2)** to position next to the leverRight ('b').\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action allows you to interact strategically with the lever to manipulate the joints, opening a pathway. My expectation is that this move will allow for better positioning to subsequently move either up or interact with the suitcase in the following turn."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar ('a') is located at (row 8, col 3). The surrounding environment consists of walls (the \u2018p\u2019 sprites) and the lever (the '*' sprite) at (row 8, col 1). The goal is to maneuver the suitcase ('$') to contact a passenger ('l') at (row 8, col 30), while avoiding death ('%') and walls.\n\nThe avatar's immediate actions should consider the potential risks of rotating or moving. No risk of collision exists in this specific moment since there are no obstacles immediately around the avatar.\n\nSince my avatar does not change its position after any previous action, I need to analyze the setup. I will try to move **LEFT** to position myself next to the lever, which will potentially allow me to manipulate other objects if needed. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to position (row 8, col 2) should provide better options for interacting with the lever or repositioning without hazards. I expect this action to align with my plan for managing the environment and navigate towards the passenger effectively."

    "content": "Given the current state where your avatar (represented by 'a') is located at (row 8, col 2), your immediate surroundings reveal the following relevant elements:\n\n- Directly to the left (row 8, col 1) is a lever (represented by '*').\n- Directly to the right (row 8, col 3) is another lever (represented by 'b').\n- Below (row 9, col 2) there is a lever as well (represented by '&').\n\nThe objective is to maneuver the suitcase (represented by '$') to interact with the passengers (represented by 'l'), while avoiding the 'death' sprite (represented by '%') and walls (represented by 'p').\n\n### Current Strategy\n1. Immediate interactions with the levers may aid in altering the positions of the joints or openings for navigation.\n2. Since the avatar's position hasn't changed in the last turn, I will take a different action to interact with the environment.\n\n### Action Choice\nGiven that there are useful levers nearby, I will first interact with the lever directly to the left of the avatar.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action aims to pull the lever and potentially change the movement dynamics of the joint mechanisms, enabling further movement options in the next turn. My expectation is to see how this action opens up new pathways or changes the layout for navigating the suitcase."
