Interact with the lever '*', which might create a pathway.\n2. Assess if the lever to the right 'b' could do something beneficial.\n\n### Initial Move Decision:\nSince the lever '*' is directly to the left and seems to be a potential point for creating new pathways/strategic advantages, I will move to the left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is expected to allow me to interact with the lever, thus possibly providing a significant shift in the current gameplay state for further strategic maneuvers."
