I can see a key at (11,1), and several gold pieces as well as the exit ('$') at (1,20).\n\n### Strategy Consideration\nSince the avatar cannot move left or right due to walls, the focus should be on moving up or down. Since moving up will not take me close to any objectives due to its distance, I should explore below.\n\nThus, I will choose to move **downward** to position (19,1), where there is an empty space.
