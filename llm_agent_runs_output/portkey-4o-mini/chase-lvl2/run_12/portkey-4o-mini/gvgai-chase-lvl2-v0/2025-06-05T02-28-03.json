Enable the 'scared' sprites to escape while preventing the avatar from being counted against the score (i.e., avoid increasing the 'avatar' count).\n2. Guide 'scared' sprites ideally toward 'carcass' states without allowing the avatar to be too close to any 'angry' sprites.\n\n### Consideration of Actions\n1. The avatar is at (9, 8), implying we are currently positioned in a field with potential avenues for movement.\n2. To strategize effectively, the immediate vicinity of the avatar should be considered:\n   - Up (8, 8): '.'\n   - Down (10, 8): '#'\n   - Left (9, 7): '.'\n   - Right (9, 9): '.'\n\n### Analysis of Potential Actions\n- **ACTION_UP** (to (8, 8)): It is open ('.'), no immediate threats.\n- **ACTION_DOWN** (to (10, 8)): It's a wall ('#'), impossible to move.\n- **ACTION_LEFT** (to (9, 7)): It's open ('.'), no immediate threats.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT** (to (9, 9)): It's open ('.'), no immediate threats.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven the situation where the avatar can either move upwards or left right, either of the available actions should maintain the avatar in a safe zone while observing the surrounding sprites. However, moving **up** gives a better vantage point to see the rows of 'scared' sprites above. \n\nLet's execute the action of moving **up**:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nFeedback: I expect this movement to yield a broader view of the surrounding sprites while keeping the avatar safe from potential threats."

However, since there's no immediate threat from 'angry' sprites, both routes could be valid.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven the strategy of monitoring the position and avoiding direct confrontation while also considering movement toward the 'scared' sprites:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving **Down** to (8, 4) keeps the avatar safe, exploits open space, and allows for subsequent movement options towards surrounding 'scared' sprites or to evade an 'angry' sprite if it appears."

The avatar is currently surrounded by a mix of spaces that allow movement and walls that obstruct it.\n2. The 'scared' sprites are above at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 15), (1, 21), and (1, 22), as well as scattered across the map, which could be converted into 'carcass' states if I manage a scared sprite effectively.\n\nGiven that my avatar has not moved from its last state and is facing potential threats from 'angry' sprites (if they exist), my first action should be to attempt to move left into an open space without facing a wall, which could lead to further significant movement options afterward.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nI will move left to (9, 4) and expect to position myself better while avoiding potential collisions with walls."

Given the layout, the avatar can't directly approach the scared sprites without running into walls. \n\nIn this situation, the strategy suggests avoiding moving towards potential threats (angry sprites) and instead focus on creating routes for \"scared\" sprites to win.\n\n### Proposed Action\nSince the position of the avatar is likely to remain the same after the action due to nearby walls (a rotation might occur if I choose up or down), the best action that allows for movement while analyzing the dynamics is to move **left** towards (6, 5), as this position is free and allows an exploration of future moves.\n\n### Deciding the Action\nLet's choose to move left:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow for exploration of the nearby points while keeping the avatar safe and not increasing 'avatar' sprite counts.
