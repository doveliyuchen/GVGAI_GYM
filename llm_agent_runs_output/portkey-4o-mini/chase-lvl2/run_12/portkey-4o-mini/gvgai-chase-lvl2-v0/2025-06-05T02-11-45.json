Let's try rotating to the left (the empty space) and see if it expands my options.\n\nBased on this examination, I will execute a rotation:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nThis action is a left rotation that will allow me to potentially reposition more effectively and explore movements after.

However, they are quite far from the current row of the avatar (row 9).\n\n3. **Available Actions for Movement**:\n   - I can move left to (9, 3), right to (9, 5), or try heading towards row 8, but the wall limits vertical movement.\n\n### Strategy Decision:\nGiven that my current position does not change from the last state, I will need to rotate and then potentially move horizontally. According to the above analysis, moving left or right doesn't immediately convert any scared sprites, but I should assess the horizontal paths available.\n\nGiven the proximity to the available scared sprites in row 1, I will move left (to (9, 3)) to scout for a better pathway upwards next turn.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis left action aims to position myself better for optimizing my movement towards collecting scared sprites while evaluating further moves.
