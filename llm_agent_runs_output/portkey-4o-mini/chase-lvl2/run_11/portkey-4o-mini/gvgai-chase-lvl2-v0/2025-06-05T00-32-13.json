Interacting with scared sprites will turn them into angry sprites if they come into contact with a carcass. We must explore how to effectively manage the scared sprites.\n\n2. **Current Actions:** The avatar needs to be careful moving toward the scared sprites while avoiding proximity to any potential angry sprites, especially since they're not currently visible but could emerge from interactions.\n\n3. **Optimal Move:** Moving towards one of the scared sprites (for instance, the one on (1, 1)) can be a beneficial strategy. However, there are walls that may hinder immediate movement towards some scared sprites.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n- Given the avatar's current position (7, 9) and the need to navigate towards the scared sprites, I will choose to move:\n\n``` \nAction: 3\n```\n\n**Feedback on the Action:** This action involves moving **down**, which would lead the avatar to (8, 9). This maintains a strategic approach by providing more insights about surrounding movements, moving closer towards potential interactions without adjacent threats. After executing this, it's essential to reassess the surroundings in case alterations to strategy are required."

Moving downwards or upwards will keep the avatar's position unchanged.\n- The nearest scared sprites (@) are located at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 13), (1, 14), (1, 20), (1, 21), (2, 1), (2, 0), etc., but they are not immediately reachable.\n\nBased on the mechanics, my avatar cannot move through walls. There are no immediate threats from angry sprites around (as seen from the current map), so I need to consider my next move:\n\n### Strategic Move:\nThe game mechanics suggest that I should rotate my avatar to face an open direction if I choose to move. Since the avatar is currently downward positioned and blocked on the left and right, I have two potential actions:\n- Move UP towards (7, 4), but there's a wall on (7, 4).\n- Move DOWN towards (9, 4), but again, there's nothing of note except more walls.\n\nIn the current context, it would be prudent to rotate towards an open space and check my surroundings for possible movement next time if required.\n\nSince no valid moves change the avatar's position effectively, I will perform another action to rotate the avatar upward and check for any further movement options in the next turn, maintaining awareness of the layout.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis should allow me to reassess the environment after a potential rotation.

To achieve this, the following is recommended:\n\n1. **Move towards a scared sprite:** The avatar can move towards one of the scared sprites to interact with them.\n2. **Avoiding walls:** Given the positioning of walls around the avatar, a move upwards (to (8, 5)) or leftward (to (9, 4)) could enable interaction with more sprites.\n3. **Path to maximize sprites:** Since both rows 1 and 2 contain multiple scared sprites, the strategy should ensure movement toward these rows where possible.\n\n### Action Decision:\nTo begin interacting with the sprites but to avoid moving into a wall, I will opt to move **up to (8, 5)**.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThe expectation is to engage the environment more effectively and position for potentially capturing scared sprites in the next move."

The most immediate task is to find a way for the avatar to get closer to at least one of the scared sprites without coming in contact with any potentially hostile entities.\n\nConsidering the current map configuration:\n- The avatar is surrounded by walls on the left and further down (row 7 has walls), and there is clear space to the right and below but going down could result in hitting walls and might not be an ideal route.\n\nThe best way to approach this is to move left, as there are multiple scared sprites in row 1 that can be targeted if we can get to them safely.\n\nHowever, since we are currently in a position where movement might be limited due to walls obstructing paths, \"ACTION_LEFT\" could change the orientation of the avatar. We need to check if any further actions can take place after turning. If the position remains unchanged after the first action, then I plan to take ACTION_DOWN next (to explore further).\n\nLet's execute the action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis leftward action will help manage navigation towards a more advantageous position to target the scared sprites while keeping a safe distance from angry entities. I expect that after this action, the avatar either maintains its position or moves to a different column, allowing for further maneuvering."

Moving down, left, or right is feasible.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n1. **Objective Focus:** The goal is to get closer to the scared sprites ('@'). From the map, looking at row 1 (where several scared sprites are located) will help fulfill the objective of transforming them into carcasses.\n2. **Maintain Safety:** Avoid paths that could bring you near an angry sprite (if one were present in this confined space, assess based on visible area).\n\n### Best Move Selection:\n- **Down (to 9,3):** This keeps the avatar safe and might allow for future flexibility.\n- **Left (to 8,2):** This also keeps the avatar safe but doesn't bring it closer to the scared sprites.\n- **Right (to 8,4):** Similar to moving left, this doesn\u2019t do much towards reaching the scared sprites but keeps the immediate area safe.\n\nThe most strategic move considering future movements and safety while not making immediate contact with walls or threats is to move **down** towards a free space.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down seems advantageous as it opens the path for future movement towards the area with scared sprites, aligning with the strategy to engage with them while maintaining safety."
