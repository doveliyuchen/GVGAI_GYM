In this case, moving upwards or downwards may give me better options for interactions with the scared sprites nearby.\n\n### Decision\nMoving upwards to `(7, 11)` will open possibilities to eventually interact with the scared sprites on this row and further explore the maze.

According to the layout, there are no angry sprites nearby, but there are many scared sprites (positions: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14), (1, 15), (1, 20), (1, 21), (1, 22), (3, 21), (3, 22), (4, 22)). \n\nNow, I can move either up, down, left, or right. To maximize potential interaction with scared sprites, it's ideal to move towards (1, 1) where there are two scared sprites nearby. \n\n### Action Selection:\n**Action: ACTION_UP (4)** - This would move the avatar to (8, 9) where there is a wall above (7, 9), effectively staying in place relative to the sprites. \n\nI will try moving up to see if the avatar rotates; if there is no change in position, I'll try moving again. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action is intended to reposition towards the nearest scared sprites while assessing movement dynamics in response to the walls."

    "content": "Given the current position of the avatar at (9, 9) and the surrounding game state, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The direct surroundings of the avatar:\n   - Above (8, 9): a wall (#)\n   - Below (10, 9): a wall (#)\n   - Left (9, 8): free space (.)\n   - Right (9, 10): free space (.)\n   \n2. The nearest 'scared' NPCs (@) are located at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14), (1, 15), (1, 20), (1, 21), and above the row of the avatar.\n\n3. The strategy involves maximizing the 'scared' NPCs while avoiding contact with 'angry' NPCs (not currently visible in the immediate vicinity of the avatar).\n\nPlan of action:\n- The avatar needs to either move left (to (9, 8)) or right (to (9, 10)). \n- Since both left and right are free spaces, either direction could be explored but moving toward the area with more scared sprites is preferable.\n  \nConsidering the positions of the scared NPCs are primarily positioned in row 1, it might be beneficial to move right to explore further options, as it could create future opportunities to navigate vertically to reach those sprites while ensuring the avatar remains safe.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nI expect moving right will keep the avatar safe while giving more options to later make a strategic move toward the scared NPCs in the upper rows."
