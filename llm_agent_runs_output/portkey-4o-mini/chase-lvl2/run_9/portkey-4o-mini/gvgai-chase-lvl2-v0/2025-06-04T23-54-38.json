Based on the provided strategies and the map layout, the goal remains to transform all scared birds ('@') into carcasses ('$') while avoiding any interactions with angry birds.\n\nThe immediate action for the avatar would be to consider the nearby scared birds. The closest ones are at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 19), (1, 20), (1, 21), and (1, 22). Carcasses are at (8, 17). \n\nMoving the avatar closer to the carcass seems strategic to facilitate collecting it. \n\nSince the avatar can only move down (to (9, 16)) or up (to (7, 16)), and given surrounding walls blocking it on either left or right, the move choice is to head down. Moving down also keeps potential interactions with scared birds open if you later choose to convert them into carcasses.\n\nThus, I choose: \n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis move keeps the avatar away from walls and clear of angry birds, while also allowing subsequent possible interactions with the nearby scared birds as needed based on further evaluations."

The avatar is in a relatively safe position but is surrounded by walls, limiting its immediate movement options.\n2. The nearest scared birds are located at (1, 1) and (1, 2), among others, which are situated quite far vertically from the avatar\u2019s current position.\n3. The goal is to avoid interactions with angry birds while converting scared birds into carcasses, which grants points.\n\n### Immediate Options for Movement\nGiven the avatar's current position and the goal of turning scared birds into carcasses, the possible actions that would lead toward accomplishing the goal while avoiding danger are moving left, right, down, or up. \n\nSince the avatar is currently at (9, 19):\n- Moving **left** (to (9, 18)) is possible since it\u2019s an empty space.\n- Moving **up** would also navigate vertically in the midst of walls, which does not provide immediate access.\n- Down is inaccessible due to walls (since rows below contain walls).\n- Right would hit walls as well.\n\n### Selected Action\nThe safest and most strategic action to take is moving **left** to (9, 18).\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to (9, 18) will help in assessing the next potential moves while remaining safe from angry birds. My expectation is that this action will create more options for subsequent actions and facilitate further movement toward the scared birds."

The surrounding state includes several scared sprites ('@') and walls ('#'). The objective is to convert the scared sprites into carcasses ('$') while avoiding angry birds and preventing danger to my avatar.\n\nFrom the current position:\n- The next immediate moves available are:\n  - Left (to (9, 6)), which is an empty space.\n  - Right (to (9, 8)), which is also an empty space.\n  - Up (to (8, 7)), which is another empty space.\n  - Down (to (10, 7)), which is also an empty space.\n\nGiven that the avatar's last position didn't change, and based on the strategy to avoid any risks and stay proactive, I will choose to move up to (8, 7). This keeps options open for the next move while staying clear of direct threats. \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to explore the area further while adhering to the overall safe strategy, maintaining distance from any potential threats from the angry birds while monitoring the surrounding sprites."

Moving up instead keeps me in proximity to the carcass at (8, 17) without putting me at risk from any immediate threats.\n\nThus, I choose to move **up** to (row 8, col 7).\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action keeps me safe while allowing further opportunities to interact with scared sprites and progress towards transforming them into carcasses.

This maintains the avatar's position while exploring other parts of the board.\n\nI'll execute the action by moving left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left seems logical since it will let me explore more of the immediate area while keeping a safe distance from potential threats.
