This provides space for my next move towards the goal at (4, 1) without directly interacting with an enemy.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will allow me to assess the next moves towards the goal while evaluating the interaction of the crates around me.

I need to avoid direct confrontation.\n\n3. **Possible Actions:**\n   - Moving **UP (to row 4, col 4)** would allow me to push the crate and create a path towards the goal. \n   - Moving **LEFT (to row 5, col 3)** won\u2019t get me closer to the goal but would keep me safe for another turn.\n\nSince I did not move last turn, I will now take the action to move **UP** to interact with the crate.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI have chosen to move UP, intending to push the crate towards the left which may help create a path towards the goal.

Since moving right will not change the avatar's position and will not engage any objects directly, moving left may be more strategically beneficial by allowing for interaction with a crate.\n2. **Avoiding Enemies:** Since the nearest enemy is far away, we can focus on manipulating crates to potentially eliminate more points and create a pathway to the goal, which is located at (row 4, col 1).\n\n### Proposed Action:\nSince moving left will involve the interaction with a crate and could set up further strategic play, I will opt for that.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nBy moving left into the crate, I expect to create a chain reaction that might set me up for future moves while avoiding the enemies effectively."

The surroundings include walls, crates, and a goal, which is located at (4, 1). \n\nHere's the immediate consideration based on the strategy outlined:\n\n1. **Position of the Avatar and Goal**: The goal is to the left of the avatar. The walls prevent movement in that direction if there's an obstruction.\n2. **Obstacles and Enemies**: An enemy is located to the right of the avatar at (2, 10). Moving towards that direction poses a risk to health points.\n3. **Crates**: The crate layout suggests there are movable crates that could be used to potentially eliminate any enemies obstructing the path or facilitate movement towards the goal.\n\nSince the goal is two spaces away directly left, the objective will be to try and move left:\n\n- **Initial Action**: Move left (to (4, 3)) to check if that's clear.\n\nExecuting the action:\n\n```Action: 1```\n\nThis action keeps focus on the goal while maintaining health through distancing from enemies. The expectation is to either encounter more pathways towards the goal or create a safe route by assessing further interactions."

Moving towards them without proper planning risks losing health.\n- **Potential Moves:** The immediate options for movement from (6, 5) will allow for left (to 6, 4) or right (to 6, 6).\n\n### Strategy Implementation:\nTo get closer to the goal while avoiding immediate threats:\n1. Moving **LEFT** to (6, 4) does not seem to pose a direct risk from enemies and allows positioning near clusters of crates which may be useful for later actions.\n2. Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 6) keeps the avatar in the open but it's directionally less beneficial towards reaching the goal.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it would be most strategic to move **LEFT** in order to reposition towards the crates and potentially create a path towards the goal later.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should help in positioning your avatar closer to potential strategic plays with crates while keeping a safe distance from the enemies."
