The avatar can navigate towards crates to potentially manipulate them for scoring or to reach the goal.\n2. Since the avatar needs to move effectively around the map while avoiding enemies, the immediate choices should support either clearing obstacles or maneuvering towards the goal.\n\n### Available Actions:\nTo decide the next action, I need to analyze possible moves from the current position (row=7, col=6):\n- **Move DOWN (row=8, col=6):** This cell is empty (.), moving down will not provide immediate benefits or danger.\n- **Move UP (row=6, col=6):** This cell is also empty (.), provides no significant strategic advantage.\n- **Move LEFT (row=7, col=5):** There is a crate (@) which could be useful either for movement later or clearing.\n- **Move RIGHT (row=7, col=7):** This cell is empty (.), similar to downward and upward moves.\n\n### Decision:\nSince we have crates to the left at (row=7, col=5), moving left can set us up to interact with the crate and possibly move it later or plan for a future action involving it.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left towards the crate positions me strategically for potential future actions involving crate interactions or towards the goal path. Since this action will change my position and allows for further exploration of the gameplay mechanics, it aligns well with the outlined strategy."
