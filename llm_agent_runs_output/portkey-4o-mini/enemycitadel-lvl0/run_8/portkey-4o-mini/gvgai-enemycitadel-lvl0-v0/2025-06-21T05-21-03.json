To do this, it may be wise to start interacting with the crates to create more advantageous paths or push towards holes, which can contribute to scoring.\n\nGiven there are crates directly around the avatar at (5, 3) to the left and further up, moving left is a suitable action to position closer to holes and avoid any potential enemies.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action moves the avatar left to (5, 3), which allows for further strategic placement next move and positions closer to pushing crates. This aligns with the strategy of manipulating the environment."
