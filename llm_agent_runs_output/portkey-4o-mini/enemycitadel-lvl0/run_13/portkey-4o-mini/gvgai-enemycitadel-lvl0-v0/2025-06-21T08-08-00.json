The avatar's immediate surroundings consist of crates (`@`), free spaces (`.`) and walls (`%`). Below are the relevant observations:\n\n1. The goal is at (4, 1), directly above the current level.\n2. There is an enemy at (4, 4) and (4, 5), so moving directly towards the goal requires careful planning to avoid damage.\n3. The avatar can only move to open spaces. The adjacent tiles (from (5, 5)) are:\n   - Up (4,5): Enemy (`#`)\n   - Down (6,5): Crate (`@`)\n   - Left (5,4): Open space (`.`)\n   - Right (5,6): Open space (`.`)\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n1. **Move Up (to 4, 5)**: This would have the avatar directly collide with an enemy, leading to damage.\n2. **Move Down (to 6, 5)**: The avatar would land on a crate, but doesn't progress towards the goal.\n3. **Move Left (to 5, 4)**: This is an open space, allowing for further movement next turn.\n4. **Move Right (to 5, 6)**: This is also an open space, and similarly allows for further movement next turn.\n\nTo progress towards winning, the best action would be to move left (to (5, 4)) because it opens up new potential moves without advancing directly into danger.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left is strategic as it keeps the avatar safe from enemies while allowing for further options in the next turn."
