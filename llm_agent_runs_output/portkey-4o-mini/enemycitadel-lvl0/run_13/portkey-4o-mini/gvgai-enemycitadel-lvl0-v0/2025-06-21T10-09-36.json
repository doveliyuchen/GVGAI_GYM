The direct path to the goal is LEFT. However, going left alone may be risky since the avatar might not be able to avoid the enemy if it gets close.\n\n2. **Safety First**: Since both enemies are on the same column (col 10) but at different rows, they aren't close enough to pose an immediate threat. However, it\u2019s important to move strategically and avoid being pushed into them or trapped, especially with walls nearby.\n\n3. **Maximizing Safety**: Before moving towards the goal directly, it might be wise to create some space or barriers.
