Nonetheless, I have the following strategy to approach the situations ahead:\n\n**Next Potential Actions:**\nSince my avatar will need to engage with nearby `@` sprites to convert them, the next immediate positions to consider would be moving towards (5, 7) or (6, 6), as both directions are clear.\n\nAmong the available options, moving:\n- **UP (to 4, 6)** will hit a wall.\n- **LEFT (to 5, 5)** is open.\n- **RIGHT (to 5, 7)** is open.\n- **DOWN (to 6, 6)** is open.\n\n**Chosen Action: RIGHT (5, 7):**\nI will execute the action to move right to position (5, 7).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis move should keep me safe from the `angry` sprites while positioning me closer to interact with the `scared` sprites. I expect to see if this aligns with the goal of transforming scared sprites into carcasses."

Convert all `scared` (`@`) sprites into `carcass` (`$`) sprites.\n2. Avoid colliding with the `angry` (`%`) sprite, which is located at (row=2, col=9) as this would result in losing points.\n\n### Current Sprite Positions:\n- `avatar (a)` at (2, 8)\n- `angry (%)` at (2, 9) - adjacent to my avatar, posing immediate danger.\n- `scared (@)` sprites at:\n  - (1, 22)\n  - (2, 7) \n  - (3, 22)\n  - (6, 15)\n  - (6, 22)\n  - (8, 22)\n  - (9, 13)\n\n### Move Analysis:\n- Given the adjacent `angry` sprite, I must avoid moving into that position. \n- The possible movements from (2, 8) are:\n  - Left to (2, 7): this is a `scared` sprite (`@`), which would allow me to convert it to `carcass` ($).\n  - Right to (2, 9): this leads into the `angry` sprite, which I should avoid.\n  - Up (to (1, 8)) or Down (to (3, 8)) are both valid movements into empty spaces.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. My immediate priority should be to move left to (2, 7) to convert the `scared` sprite into a `carcass`.\n2. After this, I must stay cautious regarding the `angry` sprite beside me and plan my next moves.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action of moving left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\n\nBy moving left, I hope to efficiently transform the `scared` sprite into a `carcass`, keeping my strategy aligned toward winning while avoiding immediate danger from the `angry` sprite."
