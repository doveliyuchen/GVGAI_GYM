The closest scared sprites are located above you and to the left. You should ideally head in their direction without attracting any angry sprites.\n\n3. **Determining Movement**: The left and up movements will lead you toward more scared sprites.

The walls (`#`) are distributed throughout the map, blocking direct pathways. \n\n### Next Move:\nSince you're currently positioned at (1, 7), your next logical move would be to approach one of the scared sprites directly, while still keeping an eye on any possible threats from the angry sprites (which are not listed in the current state).\n\nYou can move down to (2, 7) where there is a scared sprite. This aligns with the strategy of transforming scared sprites into carcasses.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will take the action to move down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nExpecting that this move will bring me closer to transforming the scared sprite and keeping my options open for further moves."
