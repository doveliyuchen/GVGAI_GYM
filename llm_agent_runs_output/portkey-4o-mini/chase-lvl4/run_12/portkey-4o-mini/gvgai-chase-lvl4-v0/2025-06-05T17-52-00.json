My current position doesn't seem to allow immediate access to those 'scared' sprites without encountering obstacles or running into a wall.\n\nConsidering my position, a potential action would be to move up (to (6, 4)). However, since the state from the last position remains unchanged, I need to carefully select an action to keep progressing towards the win condition and not risk encountering dangers. The south direction may also open more movement opportunities given the number of empty spaces below.\n\nI'll choose to move down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move could allow me more strategic positions while analyzing the proximity of 'scared' sprites for further actions."

I expect this aligns with creating movement options toward capturing 'scared' sprites without being trapped or losing points to 'angry' sprites."
