The objective is to convert all scared sprites ('@') into carcasses, which can only happen when they come into contact with your avatar.\n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n1. The scared sprites are located at (1, 21), (1, 22), (2, 22), (3, 21), (3, 22), (4, 22), and (5, 22). There are a lot of potential interactions above the current row of your avatar.\n2. There are walls '#' that prohibit movement, and moving next to them can lead to potential movement back due to collision.\n3. Your current position is away from most of the scared sprites.\n\n**Strategy Moving Forward:**\nSince you need to get closer to the scared sprites without being obstructed by walls, the best immediate action is to move **UP** toward row 7 where there are pathways leading further up to the scared sprites.\n\nThus, the best action now is:\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action will move you up into row 7 and will help you progress toward converting scared sprites located higher in the layout. Immediate feedback expected: I should be positioned closer to the group of scared sprites in the upper rows afterward, allowing for future movements to interact with them more effectively."

The avatar lacks immediate movement toward any obstacle or enemy, providing a prime opportunity to contemplate actions.\n\n**Next Move:**\nThe best action for the avatar is to either maneuver towards a scared sprite to possibly convert it into a carcass or position itself better in the vicinity of the open spaces to manipulate scared sprites later on strategically.\n\nSince the walls are adjacent on both the left and right (col=7 and col=9 respectively), the avatar cannot move sideways. Moving Up (to row=8, col=8) or Down (to row=10, col=8) are the viable options. Up is the preferred direction considering it allows greater access to potential open areas and paths toward the scared sprites.\n\nThus, executing the action to move Up will make sense to explore and advance toward achieving the win condition.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up will position me in a better spot to consider the next steps toward interacting with the scared sprites, aligning with the overall strategy."

Avoid confrontation with the 'angry' sprites.\n2. Focus on directing 'scared' sprites towards the 'carcass'.\n3. Keep a path clear of obstacles to ensure safe movement and rotation if needed.\n\n### Potential Initial Actions:\n- The avatar can move left, right, up, or down into open spaces, with potential interactions with 'scared' sprites.\n\nGiven the current avatar position (6, 4):\n1. **UP (5, 4):** This position is currently empty ('.'). \n2. **DOWN (7, 4):** This position is also empty ('.').\n3. **LEFT (6, 3):** This position is empty ('.').\n4. **RIGHT (6, 5):** This position is empty ('.').\n\nNone of the movements directly lead to interactions with the 'scared' sprites.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOf these options, the safest and most strategic move would be to go **UP** to (5, 4) since it keeps the avatar away from potentially encountering any threats while also advancing towards open space. It also gives flexibility for future moves toward scared sprites below.\n\nTherefore, I will take the action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action allows me to position my avatar higher towards row 5, which may lead me towards future interactions with 'scared' sprites strategically positioned below in row 1 through 4."

There are walls (#) and empty spaces (.) mostly in the vicinity.\n  \n### Strategy Recap:\n1. **Avoid the Angry Sprites:** Ensure that you do not engage with enemies to preserve your avatar.\n2. **Focus on Scared Sprites:** Convert the scared sprites into carcasses, which can then be used strategically.\n3. **Plan Your Movements:** As the avatar cannot orient or move in the presence of walls, it's essential to find optimal paths that utilize available clears.\n\n### Current Situation:\nThe optimal strategy now involves moving towards the scared sprites. Since there are scared sprites vertically aligned down column 22, moving towards that column could allow the avatar to interact with them.\n\nConsidering the option available right now, the avatar can either:\n- Move left (which is direction 1)\n- Move right (which is direction 2)\n- Move down (direction 3)\n- Move up (direction 4)\n\nIn this case, since there's no immediate threat from angry sprites near the avatar's position, moving up or down could create scenarios for potential conversion of scared sprites.\n\n### Recommended Move:\nI will move **up** (direction 4) to position (6, 10) to explore options for future interactions with the scared sprites.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action is expected to bring me closer to the line of scared sprites, setting me up for potential points conversion in subsequent moves."
