None of the available actions (left, right, up, down) result in immediate success\u2014either hitting walls or failing to approach any scared sprites.\n\nTo leverage the situation effectively to help achieve the goal, I should examine the best general response option through rotation without moving since moving does not yield a valid transformation at this point.\n\n### Rotating for Better Positioning:\nSince the rules state that certain direction actions could first cause the avatar to rotate, I will initiate a left move, even if there's no immediate benefit, as it allows another direction to be considered next.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis left action is intended as a preparatory step; with the assumption that further beneficial moves may open up after checking any subsequent state changes post-rotation."

The avatar is surrounded by walls on the left and right sides (at columns 4 and 6), which restricts lateral movement.\n2. Moving downwards (to (7, 5)) would maintain the current position in terms of avoiding angry sprites, although no immediate interaction appears to happen with any sprites.\n3. Moving upwards (to (5, 5)) would yield a similar non-impactful state, since there are no immediate interactions.\n4. The most strategic move appears to be to maneuver towards the nearest scared sprite. The closest one horizontally is at (1, 21), which is significantly up the grid. Therefore, I should look for the best path to get to it.\n\nGiven the current surroundings, since no immediate interactions with scared sprites are happening, I need to confirm the avatar hasn\u2019t moved after any attempted actions. Since the walls adjacent to the avatar block potential movement in some directions, I will try to move down initially to assess if the avatar\u2019s position changes, helping to reveal new options.\n\nI will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis downward action is expected to be safe and will allow exploration of the potential pathways leading towards the scared sprites.

The majority of these sprites are located towards the left side of the grid, while walls ('#') block various paths.\n\nGiven the goal of transforming scared sprites into carcasses while avoiding angry sprites, the first step is to approach the nearest scared sprite. The closest scared sprite at the moment is at (7, 22).\n\nSince my current position is (9, 11), I need to move back in the horizontal direction (to the left) while avoiding walls. The best move will be to move left towards (9, 10) first to clear the path closer to the scared sprites.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action reflects going left to approach the position of the scared sprites while adhering to the strategy of converting scared sprites into carcasses and avoiding risks posed by any other sprites. My expectation is to be one step closer to my target (7, 22)."
