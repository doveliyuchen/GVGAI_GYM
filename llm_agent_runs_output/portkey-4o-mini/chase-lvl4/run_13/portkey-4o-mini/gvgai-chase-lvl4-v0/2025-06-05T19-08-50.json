The goal will be to move towards the area where scared sprites are located.\n\n### Available Actions\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Move left to (row 9, col 7).\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move right to (row 9, col 9).\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Move down is blocked (as it leads into walls at (row 10, col 8)).\n4. **ACTION_UP (4)**: Move up to (row 8, col 8).\n\n### Analysis of Actions\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Could move the avatar closer to the wall but does not put it near any scared sprites.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Moves to (row 9, col 9) but stays away from interaction with scared sprites.\n- **ACTION_UP (4)**: Moves to (row 8, col 8) which provides some vertical flexibility, though still does not assist in approaching the scared sprites directly.\n\nThe best action, while ensuring movement effectiveness toward confronting the scared sprites, would be **ACTION_UP** (4). This movement doesn't lead immediately to a scared sprite but keeps open the possibility for future interactions while distancing safely from walls.\n\nNow taking the recommended action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\nThis action is expected to allow for more strategic positioning in future turns, enabling a better approach to scared sprites above and potentially engaging them more effectively on the next move."

The closest one to your vertical level is located at (3, 21) or (3, 22). Moving directly towards the nearby scared sprites will help to engage with them effectively.\n\nCurrently, the available actions are:\n- Up (ACTION_UP)\n- Down (ACTION_DOWN)\n- Left (ACTION_LEFT)\n- Right (ACTION_RIGHT)\n\nGiven the positioning, we will initiate movement towards the scared sprites by moving **up**.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move my avatar upward towards the scared sprites, allowing for a strategic interaction in the next turn.

Since the avatar is currently located in a fairly open area, it would be strategic to start moving towards where the scared sprites are located, to begin the process of converting them to carcasses.\n\nGiven that moving up or right would take the avatar into a safer position without immediate threat, I will choose to move left (which may not be ideal due to walls) or right since both have walls next to them, but left has some room.\n\nHowever, since the game mechanics mention rotating and possibly needing additional directional actions, I will proceed to the right where there is space to move to clear it for when the time comes to engage with the scared sprites.\n\nTaking this into account, my action will be as follows:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to move the avatar right towards areas that can facilitate interaction with scared sprites while maintaining a safe distance from any potential threats."

The main strategy is to position the avatar to interact effectively with the scared sprites while avoiding danger from any angry sprites that might not be currently visible.\n\n### Available Moves:\nGiven the avatar's location and map layout, the immediate moves available are:\n- **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Move left to (9, 1).\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move right to (9, 3).\n- **ACTION_UP (4)**: Move up to (8, 2).\n- **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Move down to (10, 2) (which is a wall).\n\nMoving **up to (8, 2)** seems favorable since there are no walls above and this continues to provide paths upwards where scared sprites are located. It also keeps the avatar away from the wall trap situation.\n\n### Decision:\nI will choose to move the avatar up:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action brings the avatar into a potentially advantageous position to navigate towards the scared sprites, while keeping it safe from potential threats."

Moving LEFT would take the avatar to (9, 0), which is a wall and not valid. Moving RIGHT to (9, 2) is possible and would keep the avatar clear of walls.\n   - Moving UP (8, 1) would be valid as well, also moving away from walls.\n\nSince the avatar hasn't moved and is currently hindered by walls if we attempt to move left, the logical move is moving RIGHT to (9, 2).\n\n### Applying the Action:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to allow the avatar to explore further while keeping a safe distance from potential dangers and be closer to the scared sprites."

There's a clear path moving to the left (col 1) or up (towards row 8), but due to the rules regarding sprite positioning and the need to quickly interact with scared sprites, moving up seems like a viable option.\n\nLet's proceed with the action:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action moves the avatar up.

There are multiple scared sprites (represented as '@') in the vicinity, notably at positions (1, 21), (1, 22), (2, 22), (3, 21), (3, 22). \n\n### Analysis\n1. **Avatar's Position**: The avatar is currently at (9, 2).\n2. **Scared Sprites**: There are multiple scared sprites within a reachable area, but they are several rows above and will need to be chased or guided to become carcasses.\n3. **Walls**: The walls around the map create barriers, particularly in rows 0 to 4 and surrounding the avatar\u2019s current position.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the current state, the immediate goal is to move the avatar upward or toward a strategy that allows the avatar to interact with the scared sprites.\n\n- **Best Move**: Since the avatar can only interact with scared sprites by moving in their direction, I should consider moving **UP** to row 8, column 2. \n\n### Next Step\nMoving Up is a logical option to push closer to the action. Therefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to position the avatar closer to the scared sprites and allows for subsequent moves toward transforming or eliminating them."
