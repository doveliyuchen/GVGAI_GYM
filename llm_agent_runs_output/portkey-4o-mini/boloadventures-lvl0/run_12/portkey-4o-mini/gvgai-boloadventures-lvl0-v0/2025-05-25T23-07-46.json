The surrounding area around the avatar is crucial for determining the best direction.\n- The columns from (2) to (22) contain a series of clearance spaces represented by '.' and some obstacles. The path must be free of hazards like holes and boulders that would endanger the avatar.\n\n### Evaluation of Surrounding Area\n1. **Left (to col 1)**: Free space ('.').\n2. **Right (to col 3)**: Free space ('.').\n3. **Up (to row 10, col 2)**: Free space ('.').\n4. **Down (to row 12, col 2)**: Wall ('*') immediately below, no movement possible.\n\nGiven this analysis, the optimal movement is to move right towards (11, 3) because it remains on a path free of obstacles, and also brings nearer to the goal.\n\n### Directional Action\nSince the avatar needs to move right to navigate towards the goal while avoiding hazards, I will execute the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to help us progress along the path towards the goal successfully."
