I should **rotate** to face in the right direction.\n2.

The most immediate action is to navigate through the maze while avoiding hazards.\n\nGiven the layout, it seems the best move is to attempt to move to the right. Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Position**: The avatar cannot move left or up due to walls. The down direction appears accessible, but moving horizontally toward the goal is critical.\n2. **Availability of Space**: Moving right to (row=11, col=3) is possible and necessary to gradually approach the goal.\n3. **Last Action Analysis**: The last action's position did not change. Any horizontal action must account for whether the avatar could rotate and be ready for the next directional move.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the action to move the avatar right:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action allows for the avatar to shift towards the goal while staying cautious of the walls. I expect to see an improvement in position, moving closer to the objective without hindrances."
