The avatar is currently positioned in an area that is surrounded by traversable tiles but also needs to approach toward manipulating boulders and avoiding any potential threats that may arise.\n\n### Analysis and Suggestions\n1. **Immediate Options for Movement**:\n   - Moving **Up (to 8, 2)**: This leads to a free space.\n   - Moving **Down (to 10, 2)**: This also leads to a free space.\n   - Moving **Left (to 9, 1)**: This is a free space as well.\n   - Moving **Right (to 9, 3)**: This is a wall and not allowed.\n\n2. **Strategic Considerations**:\n   - Moving **Up** to (8, 2): This could potentially give access to further movements, but is not progressing towards the goal.\n   - Moving **Down** to (10, 2): This allows for further movement options since it connects to the below path and can help navigate towards the more clear pathway towards the goal.\n\nGiven the above assessments, moving DOWN to (10, 2) is a reasonable strategic move as it keeps the travel direction open while providing routes for further interactions.\n\n### Final Action Decision\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nMoving down to (10, 2) strategically opens up more paths for navigation.

Presently, the avatar is surrounded by a wall above, lasers to the sides, and some potential points to move downwards. This suggests that immediate movement upwards is restricted, and moving right will result in hitting a wall. Moving left or down could be valid options.\n\nExamining the positions around the avatar:\n- Moving down to (11, 2) places the avatar directly onto a boulder, which is not advisable as the avatar would be killed.\n- Moving left to (10, 1) is currently empty (ground), which would be a safe move.\n- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (10, 3), thus is not allowed.\n\nSince the last action did not change the avatar's position, we should proceed with a safe action to avoid any hazards while evaluating the most advantageous positioning going forward.\n\nBased on this analysis, the action I will take is:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this left movement to ensure the avatar stays safe while exploring further options towards the goal on the next turn."

Directly to the right at (11, 3) is a wall '*', so moving right will not help in reaching the goal.\n4. Your immediate options for movement are limited primarily due to the wall on your right. You can only potentially go left or vertically (up or down, contingent upon the game layout).\n\n### Decision Making:\nSince moving right is blocked by a wall and the strategy recommends planning movements while considering the next safest action, the most effective move would be to explore options for moving either left or down to better position yourself.\n\nSince moving left (11, 1) leads to an empty space, 'a' can explore that option while looking for a new navigation strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow us to explore more of the level and potentially find a path toward the goal as moving right is not an option, and moving down would still keep us safe until we can find concrete action towards accumulating points or reaching the goal."

The current state shows the surrounding environment, including walls ('*'), open ground ('.'), boxes ('#'), boulders ('@'), holes ('%'), and the goal ('$').\n\nTo reach the goal, the avatar must navigate through the available paths while avoiding obstacles. The immediate surroundings indicate that moving left or right could potentially lead towards clear paths. However, we should also consider the potential movement options for the upcoming turns.\n\n### Action Analysis\nStarting from position (11, 2):\n- **ACTION_LEFT (11, 1)**: Open ground ('.'), no immediate threat.\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (11, 3)**: Wall ('*'), not an option.\n- **ACTION_DOWN (12, 2)**: Wall ('*'), not an option.\n- **ACTION_UP (10, 2)**: Open ground ('.'), but further from goal.\n\n### Evaluating Options\nThe only reasonable action fully available from the current position is to move left (to (11, 1)), as moving up (to (10, 2)) also does not position the avatar closer to the goal. \n\nTherefore, the best move now is to keep moving left towards areas with potentially more paths.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nMoving left to (11, 1) allows us to explore further options in future turns and prepares the pathway to continue navigating toward the goal. I expect to plan further based on new surroundings after this action."

    "content": "To formulate a response based on the current state and the rules established for the game, I will first analyze the avatar's position and surroundings.\n\n### Current Avatar Position\nThe avatar ('a') is currently located at (10, 2) on the game map.\n\n### Nearby Entities\n- Above the avatar at (9, 2) is a free space ('.').\n- Below the avatar at (11, 2) is a boulder ('w').\n- Left of the avatar at (10, 1) is a free space ('.').\n- Right of the avatar at (10, 3) is a wall ('*').\n\n### Immediate Actions\nConsidering the surroundings, the immediate action options include:\n- Move Up to (9, 2): Free space, safe move.\n- Move Down to (11, 2): Blocked by boulder, not a viable move.\n- Move Left to (10, 1): Free space, safe move.\n- Move Right to (10, 3): Blocked by wall, not a viable move.\n\n### Strategy Based on Game Rules\nReferring to the strategic guidelines:\n- The goal is to navigate safely towards 'g'.\n- Both potential moves (Up or Left) allow the avatar to advance without encountering hazardous obstacles.\n- As I have not made a move yet, choosing between going Up or Left is valid. \n\nGiven that:\n1. The Up move (to (9, 2)) is a good choice since I avoid unnecessary complications and also promotes interaction with the upward area of the map.\n2. The Left move (to (10, 1)) will keep me on the current row and do not progress towards navigating to the goal.\n\nI will opt to move Up.\n\n### Final Action Decision\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will successfully navigate the avatar to a new position, allowing for further movement options toward potential game objectives."

    "content": "To analyze the current state of the game based on the provided map, the key information I see is my avatar's position, which is located at (10, 2). \n\n### Current Position\n- The avatar ('a') is situated in a space surrounded by walls. The nearest objects of interest are:\n  - A hole ('%') at (10, 21) and (10, 22)\n  - A goal ('$') at (11, 22)\n  \n### Potential Moves\n- From my current position, I can move:\n  - Left (to (10, 1)): Open space.\n  - Right (to (10, 3)): Wall.\n  - Down (to (11, 2)): Accessible path with a boulder ('@').\n  - Up (to (9, 2)): Open space.\n\n### Considering Actions\n1. **If I move left** (to (10, 1)), I will be in an open space, but it provides no immediate advantage toward moving toward the goal.\n2. **If I move right** (to (10, 3)), it's blocked by a wall, so that's not an option.\n3. **If I move down** (to (11, 2)), I will move to a space occupied by a boulder ('@'). While I can occupy this space, it doesn't help me get closer to my goal right away.\n4. **If I move up** (to (9, 2)), it's also an open space, but again won't lead me closer to the goal immediately.\n\n### Recommended Action\nSince the goal is located at (11, 22) and I need to move through the grid toward the rightmost and downward sections, I should focus on moving towards spaces that will help clear the path.\n\nThe most logical action, avoiding walls and advancing in the direction of the goal, is to **move up to (9, 2)**, which keeps my position flexible for future moves while assessing further options.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should allow me to navigate a bit more freely, and I hope to find a better route towards my ultimate goal while maintaining options for future moves."
