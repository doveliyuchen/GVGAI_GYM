However, I need to verify if I can actually proceed in that direction without hitting a wall. As indicated by columns, the next cell (11, 3) does contain a wall (`*`), so I cannot move to that position.\n\nSince the avatar does not move with the first attempted action, it's prudent to change the strategy. I need to re-evaluate and consider moving vertically or looking for another route that is open.\n\nGiven that moving up or down from (11, 2) presents limited options (up would lead to points above, which are either walls or empty spaces, down would lead to no immediate benefit), I will attempt a different direction.\n\nHere is the action I will take:\n```Action: 1```\n\nFeedback: By attempting to move left, I hope to reevaluate potential avenues that can lead to an upward trajectory or other nearby paths, since moving right is blocked, and it might allow me to navigate around any barriers.
