There are multiple obstacles and potential scoring opportunities in the vicinity:\n\n1. **Direct Path to Goal:** \n   - The direct horizontal path (row 11) to the goal at `(11, 22)` is blocked by walls (`*`) at positions `(11, 0)`, `(11, 3)`, `(11, 10)`, and `(11, 23)`. This means the avatar cannot move directly to the goal.\n\n2. **Nearby Hazards:** \n   - The row below `(12, 1)` to `(12, 23)` is entirely blocked by walls.\n\n3. **Scoring Opportunities:**\n   - There are holes available at positions `(9, 11)`, `(9, 12)`, `(9, 13)`, `(9, 14)`, and in adjacent rows `(10, 21)` and `(10, 22)`.\n\n### Strategy Based on Current Observation\n1. The avatar cannot move straight to the goal due to walls.\n2. The route to the right `(11, 2)` and `(11, 3)` leads only to more walls.\n3. The only viable action at this point would be to explore vertically or horizontally if feasible.\n\nSince moving vertically to row 10 or following through row 2 or adjacent rows does not help in making progress, a good first action is to explore left or down.\n\n### Assessing Possible Actions\n- **Move left `(11, 0)`:** Blocked by `*` wall.\n- **Move right `(11, 2)`:** Open ground `.`.\n- **Move up `(10, 1)`:** Open ground `.`.\n- **Move down `(12, 1)`:** Blocked by `*` wall.\n\nI should attempt to move right to `(11, 2)` and see if new paths or interactions emerge.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right to explore further seems to provide the best opportunity to navigate the level and identify potential paths toward the goal."

The avatar is restricted on the sides: there are walls above (10, 2) and below (12, 2), and the only available space to move horizontally is either left to (11, 1) or right to (11, 3).\n2. Moving downward is blocked by a wall, while moving upward leads to empty space.\n\n### Strategic Move:\n1. The immediate goal is to begin progressing towards the right since left is unproductive and up doesn't lead towards the goal. I will check which horizontal path leads to the goal, focusing on moving right.\n2. The right side (11, 3) is empty, allowing an unobstructed move.\n  \nGiven these considerations, the next action is to move right:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis move helps to navigate toward the goal sprite, while also staying clear of hazards, as advised in the strategy."
