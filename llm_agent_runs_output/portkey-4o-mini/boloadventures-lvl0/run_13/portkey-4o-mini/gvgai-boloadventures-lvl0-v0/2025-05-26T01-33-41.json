The only way to change strategy is to rotate towards a direction that allows for future moves. \n\nThe next logical direction of action is to attempt moving downward to access potentially new routes or interactions:\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis move expects that taking a step down could either access new spaces to maneuver around box or boulders, allowing me to check possible pathways towards the goal."

We need to deal with these obstacles first.\n\nGiven the mechanics of movement in this game's puzzle-platformer, I will need to move the avatar towards row 11, 22 while avoiding any immediate hazards.\n\n### Action Decision:\n1. **Check Surroundings:**\n   - Left of the avatar (11, 1) is empty (`.`).\n   - Right of the avatar (11, 3) is a wall (`*`).\n   - Up (10, 2) and down (12, 2) are also empty.\n\n2. **Next Step**: Since the right direction (towards the goal) is blocked by a wall, I can either:\n   - Move left to (11, 1), which would not help my goal.\n   - Move up to (10, 2), which is also clear, but will not help reach the goal directly either.\n   - Move down to (12, 2), still a non-obstruction.\n   \nFor now, it seems I should first consider moving down to see if I can then redirect back up or analyze the situation.\n\n### Final Action:\nI will opt to move down to (12, 2).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down seems like a strategic action to explore more options for potentially navigating towards the goal without immediate obstruction."

The surrounding terrain consists of walls, ground, holes, and other obstacles, with the immediate path having unblocked spaces from the avatar to the goal.\n\n### Analyzing Next Move:\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: (11, 2)\n2. **Goal Position**: (11, 22)\n3. **Obstacles**: There are walls on the first two rows, but there's a clear path available in the same row (row 11) leading horizontally towards the goal.\n4. **Hazards**: It's crucial to watch out for holes located at (1, 22) so traversal must avoid vertical movements towards those, maintaining horizontal movement towards the goal.\n\n### Planned Action:\nTo move directly towards the goal, the first action should be moving `RIGHT` to (11, 3) and subsequently continuing right towards the goal.\n\n```Action: 2```\nThis action advances directly toward the goal and is in line with the strategy to reach it efficiently, while remaining aware of any hazards along the way."

The surroundings of the goal are holes (%), which present a hazard that must be avoided while planning our route. \n\nGiven that the avatar's last action in this scenario would have kept it stationary (because it was against the wall on the right), moving left now opens up more options.\n\nSince previous actions resulted in no movement, it would be prudent to attempt moving left to see if the new position allows further navigation. \n\n```Action: 1``` \nMoving left is a sensible choice that helps explore a possible path while avoiding immediate hazards."
