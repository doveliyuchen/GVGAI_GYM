The avatar can only move left, right, up, or down.\n\n### Movement Strategy\n1. **Goal Direction**: The goal is far to the right (col 22) where there is a hole at (11, 21). Therefore, advancing directly right is limited by the presence of this hole.\n2. **Clear Pathway**: We need to navigate right while avoiding the hole. The effective route would be to navigate in such a way that we can safely sidestep or jump over obstacles.\n\n### Decision\n- The most logical action is to move to the right towards the goal as much as possible, staying clear of the hole at (11, 21) while looking for opportunities to navigate past the hazards.\n\nGiven that the avatar is initially positioned at (11, 2), I will perform the action of moving to the right (`ACTION_RIGHT`) first:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis will evaluate the immediate next move towards the goal while ensuring that I'm not moving into a hazard.

The avatar can move right (ACTION_RIGHT), which would position it at (11, 3). This would place the avatar on a ground tile ('.'), which is free of hazards, keeping it safe while moving toward the goal. \n\nContinuing to expand on the strategic plan to reach the goal:\n\n1. **Moving Right**: Moving right is safe as it leads us closer to the goal without encountering immediate hazards. \n\n2. **Continue to Assess Next Movements**: After moving to (11, 3), we can reassess to see if further right movements are obstructed by hazards until we reach (11, 22).\n\nTaking the above considerations into account, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action signifies moving right, and I anticipate that this will keep the avatar safe while progressing toward the goal."

Since the right is blocked by a wall, moving left is not an option.\n2. Moving up or down both lead to empty spaces; thus, I'll consider what lies in the subsequent rows for further progress.\n\nAfter analyzing, there are no immediate hazards in both possible movements, and the goal 'g' (or '$' in sprite form) is positioned at (11, 22), which means I need to traverse ultimately to the far right of row 11.\n\nHowever, moving up to (10, 2) doesn't seem to lead toward the goal since row 11 offers more open paths compared with row 10.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to move down as a first step instead, trusting that it may offer more access toward the right side, leading eventually to the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nI expect this action to allow me to set up for future movements to the right along row 12, opening opportunities to continue progressing towards the goal."
