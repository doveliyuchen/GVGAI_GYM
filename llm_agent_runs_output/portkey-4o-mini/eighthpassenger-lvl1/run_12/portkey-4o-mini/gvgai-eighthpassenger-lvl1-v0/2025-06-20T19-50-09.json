Our avatar ('&') is located at (5, 16). \n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n- The avatar is in a crouching position and has both standing and crouching options available, allowing for stealth.\n- Directly adjacent to the avatar's position, there is a pursuer ('%') at (5, 20) to the right, which is a danger zone.\n- To the left of the avatar (5, 15), there is a wall ('e'), so moving left is not possible.\n- Behind the avatar in the upward direction (4, 16) is an open space without any immediate threats.\n\n**Strategy Recommendations:**\nGiven the proximity of the pursuer, moving away for stealth while evaluating the surrounding areas is crucial. We can analyze the upward direction (4, 16) as there\u2019s an immediate safe space to move into, allowing us to maintain stealth from the pursuer.\n\n**Action Decision:**\nThe optimal action in this scenario is to move **up** (4, 16). This would place the avatar in a position to avoid the pursuer and evaluate further movement options safely.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up will take the avatar to a safer area, where it can observe the surroundings without being immediately detected by the pursuer."
