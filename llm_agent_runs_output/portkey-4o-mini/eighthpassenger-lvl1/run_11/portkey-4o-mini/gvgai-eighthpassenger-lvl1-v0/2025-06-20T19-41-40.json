However, moving up could lead to more potential options in the future.\n\nI will choose to move **up** (to (2, 12)) to explore the space above and avoid immediate proximity to the pursuer. \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action is aimed at strategically moving away from the pursuer and maintaining safety while I consider my next steps."

There are various threats around:\n\n- There are several alien sprites ('@') to the south, particularly concentrated in columns 8 to 17 on row 8.\n- There is a pursuer ('%') located directly above me at (3, 14).\n\nTo adhere to the recommended strategy and avoid immediate threats, I should think strategically about my next move.\n\n1. **Potential Moves**:\n   - Moving UP (to (1, 12)) may take me closer to some switches I can activate, while avoiding the pursuer directly above me.\n   - Moving LEFT or RIGHT might not be a safer option due to walls and more enemies nearby.\n   - Moving DOWN (to (3, 12)) would lead me directly next to the pursuer.\n\n2. **Consideration**: As I am currently crouching (and in a position that may require me to stay low while moving) moving UP seems to be the best option. It avoids the pursuer directly and puts me in a safer position near switches located in row 4.\n\nThus, I will move up.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should allow me to potentially reach a switch while avoiding immediate danger from the pursuer. I expect to either activate the switch or assess my next movements without being caught."
