Move towards the exit while avoiding enemy paths where possible.\n2. Be ready to interact with switches or tunnels that can provide significant tactical advantage.\n\n### Actions to Consider\nFrom my last action, it seems the avatar did not move, thus an attempt to move in a direction is prudent.\n\nAssuming the avatar is currently safe in a maze approach:\n- **Possible action** could be moving `RIGHT` if there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\n### Chosen Action\nSince the avatar position wasn\u2019t explicitly stated, and based on the assumption of trying to progress towards the right side of the map where there are fewer enemies:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action attempts to progress toward a less crowded column and ideally move closer to the exit.

The avatar is currently standing, and based on the overall strategy, crouching might allow for utilizing tunnels or hiding from the pursuer.\n\nHowever, I must ensure that I make a meaningful move to either escape the pursuer or reposition to prepare for the next move.\n\n**Deciding Action**:\n1. Crouching (action that would somewhat allow hiding) is not an action available in the commands provided. Hence, using movement would be necessary.\n2. The safest move is to go left toward (5,18) while avoiding confrontation with the pursuer. This should not only keep the avatar safe but also provide opportunities for more options next turn.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis left move avoids the pursuer and allows the opportunity for subsequent movements while staying safely away from immediate danger as per our well-laid out strategy."
