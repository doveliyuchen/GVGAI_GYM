I need to take into account any nearby turrets or bombs that might affect movement. \n2. As I am not directly moving towards the goal yet, I need to adjust my position to devise a clearer path.\n3. Most importantly, staying alive is key, rather than attempting risky moves right now.\n\nTo begin edging toward the goal, I will proceed to take a left action, moving from (12, 9) to (12, 8). \n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nPerforming this action keeps the momentum towards the goal while carefully assessing the path ahead. My expectation is to gradually progress closer to the goal without facing immediate threats from bombs or turrets in the next moves."
