The walls are located on rows 0 to 12 and in the columns on both sides of the avatar.\n- Bomb turrets **@** are present in rows 3, 4, 5, 10, and 20, dropping bombs **&**.\n- The nearest threat from a bomb turret (with bombs) is below the avatar in (10, 20) with turrets in row 10 and 11 dropping bombs towards the avatar's vicinity.\n\n### Strategy Alignment\nGiven the objectives of the game and the current state:\n1. **Navigate towards the Goal**: The avatar should move towards (11, 3), the goal, which is two rows up.\n2. **Avoid Bombs**: We must also avoid any bombs coming from the turrets. We know that turrets have a cooldown of 3 seconds, so advancing when they are not firing would be the best strategy.\n\nThe action available to move the avatar upward towards the goal is to go **UP** (row change from 13 to 12).\n\n### Expected Outcome\nTaking the action `ACTION_UP` will move the avatar up one space towards the goal.

The objective is to navigate towards the goal (represented by '#'), which is located at (11, 3). The surrounding area includes walls (represented by '%'), empty spaces (represented by '.'), and turrets (represented by '$') that can drop bombs (represented by '&').\n\nTo successfully reach the goal while avoiding hazards, I need to consider the positional tactics based on the immediate surroundings. The most important factors here are:\n\n1. The presence of walls around my current position, which can provide cover from turret attacks if needed, or restrict my movements.\n2. The need to move in a direction that brings me closer to the goal while avoiding potential danger from turrets or bombs.\n\nCurrently, I should attempt to move upwards (ACTION_UP) to get closer to the goal at (11, 3). From (13, 2), moving up to (12, 2) seems safe, as there are no hazards immediately above me.\n\nThus, I'll take the action to move upwards:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up aligns with the strategy to get closer to the goal while managing score and safety. Let's see if this brings me nearer to the goal without hitting any hazards."

The immediate path toward the goal involves moving up to (12, 2), and then continuing up to (11, 2) before moving right to the goal (11, 3).\n2. However, I need to be cautious of bomb trajectories from the turrets positioned at the following places which can potentially drop bombs in the pathway:\n   - Since turrets have cooldown times, they may not drop bombs immediately after being activated. \n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo initiate moving toward the goal while avoiding immediate danger, I will take a step **UP** to (12, 2), which is a clear path and doesn't put me in immediate risk of getting hit by bombs.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action should help me close the distance to the goal without encountering hazards. I expect to position myself toward moving to the goal while keeping an eye on bomb drops from the nearby turrets."
