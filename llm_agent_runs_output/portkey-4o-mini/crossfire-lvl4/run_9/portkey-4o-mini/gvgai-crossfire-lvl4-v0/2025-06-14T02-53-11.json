Moving right (to (13, 3)) is also viable since it is an empty space (.). Moving up or down would result in hitting a wall (%), which is not permitted by the game rules. \n\n2. **Strategic Consideration**: \n    - Along with immediate movement options, the goal is to reach the green door (goal: #) located at (11, 3). Moving into open spots helps avoid turrets (i.e., @) located further down, and hence maintaining distance from potential bomb threats is important.\n  \nSince both left and right are options that won't result in a blockage and provide greater flexibility in subsequent moves toward the goal, I will choose one of them. \n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nMoving right could potentially position the avatar closer to a path toward the goal in the next moves, as it keeps the avatar in the row where the goal lies. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should be safe and aligns with the strategy of avoiding obstacles while getting closer to our goal."

Their locations indicate potential areas to avoid.\n- The path to the goal requires either moving up two spaces vertically or finding a lateral route to ensure safety against bomb hits.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is essential to avoid turrets while moving towards the goal. There are no immediate bomb threats in the way of vertical movement to row 11, provided I navigate directly upwards.\n\nThus, the first action will be:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up to row 12, allowing for a subsequent move towards the goal in the following turns without immediate risk of bomb hits.

Since moving directly upward towards the goal (11, 3) from your current position (13, 2) may expose you to bombs from the nearby turrets, you should take a cautious approach.\n2.

Move **DOWN** is not viable as it brings you further from the goal.\n\nMoving **UP** directly towards the goal at `(11, 3)` is the most favorable option as it brings you closer.\n\n### Recommended Action:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up towards `(12, 3)` aligns with the strategy of approaching the goal while avoiding immediate danger from turrets and bombs.

The goal is located two rows above the avatar and three columns to the left.\n2. There are walls and turrets nearby, which might pose a risk during movement.\n\n### Strategy Review:\n- **Prioritize Safe Movement**: Assess the path toward the goal considering the turret positions.\n- **Observe Patterns**: Since turrets are spaced out, observe their firing patterns before making the next move.\n\nGiven the current conditions, moving **LEFT** to (13, 5) would be a logical choice since it takes the avatar closer to the goal and avoids immediate danger from the turrets. After a potential rotation, this should also allow for further assessment of the next move.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left aligns with the goal of positioning myself better toward reaching the goal while trying to avoid turrets' bomb paths."

The next safe and forward movement towards the goal can be evaluated. Moving **left** repeatedly may expose us more to turret fire and hence isn't strategic.\n\nWe could move **down (to (12, 8))**, as it allows stability in the current row while analyzing the landscape and keeping our options open for future moves towards the goal. \n\nThus, I will execute the action to move down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action is expected to keep us safe from immediate danger and maintain flexibility in planning our next move toward the goal."

Since I need to strategize my movements and ensure that I make a change from my last position, I should consider the movement options available.\n\nStarting by mapping out potential moves from my current position at (13, 5):\n- Moving left (ACTION_LEFT, location: (13, 4)) is valid and leads to an empty space.\n- Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT, location: (13, 6)) is also valid and leads to an empty space.\n- Moving down (ACTION_DOWN, location: (14, 5)) is valid but doesn't lead closer to the goal.\n- Moving up (ACTION_UP, location: (12, 5)) is valid but can encounter a wall before I reach the goal.\n\nTo ensure I do not get within the firing line of turrets while making use of walls for cover, I will choose to move left (to (13, 4)) where I still have a clear sight of potentially making further moves towards my goal. Therefore, the best move would be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nI expect this action allows me to position myself better, avoiding immediate hazards while reconsidering my next strategic steps towards the goal."
