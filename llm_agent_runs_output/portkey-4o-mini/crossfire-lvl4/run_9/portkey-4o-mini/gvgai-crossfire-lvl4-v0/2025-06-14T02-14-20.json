The next immediate action is to attempt to move left to (13, 2) to see if I can maneuver around the walls more effectively. \n\n``` Action:1 ```\nBy moving left, I am hoping to find a pathway to navigate around the walls that obstruct the direct path to the goal."

The immediate environment looks somewhat closed off, but there may be openings closer to the goal that can be used over several moves.\n\nGiven the surrounding walls, the only strategic action to take is to move ***UP***, toward (row=12, col=6) as it is the only direction that does not lead into walls.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up towards (row=12, col=6) should open up subsequent paths to navigate toward the goal effectively, so it's a crucial first step."

Here are your navigation options based on the surrounding state:\n\n1. **Going Left (Action 1)** would result in (12, 8), which is clear. However, you'll be moving further from the goal.\n2. **Going Right (Action 2)** would result in (12, 10), which is also clear, but moves parallel to the target.\n3. **Going Up (Action 4)** would take you to (11, 9), which is still clear but moving vertically could be strategic since the goal is above.\n4. **Going Down (Action 3)** results in (13, 9), no apparent benefit since there's a wall beneath that row.\n\nConsidering the first priority is to get closer to the goal and with the possibility of hitting walls impacting horizontal movement, moving **Up (Action 4)** seems to be the best strategy. This will not only keep you clear of immediate threats but also put you closer to the goal row.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis decision aligns with the strategy of maximizing your approach towards the goal while managing risk, as moving vertically appears to open up further options on your next move."

The surrounding layout contains multiple walls ('%'), along with turrets ($) and bombs (@, &). Movement needs to be strategic to reach the goal while avoiding the negative aspects.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Identify possible paths towards the goal.\n2. Plan movement while avoiding obstacles (walls, bombs, turrets).\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- Moving **LEFT** to (12, 8) will move you out of the wall area but does not progress toward the goal.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (12, 10) again does not move you toward the goal.\n- Moving **UP** to (11, 9) is not an actionable direction as your position hits a wall at (11, 9).\n- Moving **DOWN** to (13, 9) also does not result in a forward movement to the goal.\n\nYour avatar location does not change upon movement due to the proximity of walls. Therefore, the best option involves any action that can position you favorably. To reach the goal, you may consider moving into open space to explore the next move further, ensuring to check current proximity to hazards (bombs/turrets).\n\n**Initial Action Decision:**\nGiven that all major directions aside from backward lead into walls or negative interactions, the action most helpful would be:\n\n``` \nAction: ACTION_NIL \n```\n\nThis action maintains the position for further strategy adjustments since there are no safe progresses. However, the need to rotate could prompt movement further in the next turn depending on the outcome of spatial awareness. I expect this will show insight into the environment and lead to a better following action."
