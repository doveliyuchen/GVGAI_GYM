The closest vertical path toward the goal is restricted by walls '%' directly above it and potentially bomb turrets that might affect movement.\n\nGiven the current positioning and the mechanics of the game, the strategy will involve careful movements avoiding both walls and bomb turrets. Moving directly upward may cause a collision with the wall immediately in front of the avatar.\n\nSo, let's determine which action is warranted based on the surroundings:\n- Moving UP (to (row=12, col=3)) is immediately blocked by a wall.\n- Moving DOWN (to (row=14, col=3)) leads to an open area but doesn't progress toward the goal.\n- Moving LEFT (to (row=13, col=2)) is open as it has a '.' and no other obstructions.\n- Moving RIGHT (to (row=13, col=4)) would also be safe as it has '.' too.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are available, however, moving LEFT might provide better access to a path without hitting walls. \n\nTherefore, I will take the action to move LEFT. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action allows moving into a safe space and may open up further options for navigating toward the goal in subsequent turns while avoiding immediate dangers."

As I need to avoid being hit by turrets and dealing with the bomb potential, I should not just move up directly towards the goal right away.\n2. Instead, I should consider moving left or right a bit first to find a safe route that allows me to ascend without hitting walls or getting shot by turrets.\n\n### Selected Action:\n- I will first attempt to move **left** to position (13, 7).
