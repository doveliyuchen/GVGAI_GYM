The closest hazard is a wall surrounding it, and the goal (marked as '#') is located at (row 11, col 3), which is above the avatar, two rows up.\n\n### Analyzing the Current State:\n- The avatar cannot move up directly through walls.\n- To reach the goal, the avatar needs to navigate around the walls.\n- The immediate surroundings of the avatar include walls in all directions except for lateral movement.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. The avatar can move left, right, or down.\n2. Moving up is blocked by a wall.\n\n### Choosing the Action:\nSince the primary goal is to reach the door while avoiding hazards, and considering that the avatar is currently blocked from moving up directly towards the goal, moving left (Action 1) or right (Action 2) does not contribute to the goal directly, while moving down (Action 3) puts the avatar further from the goal.\n\nHowever, since moving down is the only possible action that keeps the avatar away from walls and allows further exploration, I will choose to perform the action down.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down keeps the avatar safe while allowing a potential path to open up for future moves towards the goal. I expect to see better positioning to navigate towards the upper levels for an eventual reach of the goal without triggering any negatives."

The goal is to reach the green door, which is at (row 11, col 3). The immediate surroundings of the avatar reveal the following:\n\n- The current row (row 13) has walls marked by `%` around it, limiting movement options.\n- Moving up to (row 12, col 4) would lead to a wall.\n- Moving left (to (row 13, col 3)), right (to (row 13, col 5)), or down (to (row 14, col 4)) further away are also blocked by walls.\n\nSince the avatar is currently facing a wall directly above and cannot move up, down, or to the left or right without hitting a wall, an initial action of any directional movement will only result in rotation (as per game mechanics), but won't result in movement. The avatar needs to clearly find its way around.\n\nGiven the situation, the best strategy at this moment seems to be rediscovering optimal movements. Since no immediate directions lead to new positions (because of walls), I need to execute one of the movement actions. Therefore, I will attempt to move left (Action 1) to see if it allows any maneuverability towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action allows me to reassess the position next turn, as the current options near the wall are limited."

There are also bombs ('&') at (8, 18) and (9, 18), but these are far from the current position.\n\n### Next Move Strategy\nSince the goal is not directly reachable via a horizontal or vertical path without obstructions, and the immediate area is mostly safe from hazards, we should focus on moving towards the green door while assessing the possibility of encountering turrets.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven that no gainful action aligns directly with the goal or avoids hazards, and given that the avatar's current orientation could imply no movement occurs when attempting to rotate towards a feasible direction, I will check **down**, **up**, **left**, or **right** options to see if they lead to safer paths.\n\n- **Action UP (4)**: Moves to (12, 7) - Clear, but vertically confining to walls ahead.\n- **Action DOWN (3)**: Moves to (14, 7) - Clear but also would loop into walls.\n- **Action LEFT (1)**: Moves to (13, 6) - Clear path into more open spaces.\n- **Action RIGHT (2)**: Moves to (13, 8) - Clear, but doesn't open more routes towards the goal.\n\nSince moving **LEFT** (to (13, 6)) opens a pathway towards (12, 6) in the future and avoids clutter near the trodden area near the walls, I will opt for:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action seems beneficial to keep the avatar clear of any immediate hazards while positioning it for future optimal paths towards the goal."

Given the surrounding elements, including walls and hazards such as bombs and turrets, we need to assess how to best reach the goal while minimizing risk.\n\n### Current Observations:\n\n1. The area directly between the avatar and the goal is relatively clear, but moving left immediately would lead towards a wall at (11,7).\n2. The path to the goal at (11,3) involves moving left through columns that may include hazards (like turrets dropping bombs).\n\n### Suggestion for Action:\n\nThe next logical action based on the avatar's position and immediate options would be to rotate and then move left, as the left cell (11,7) is a wall which requires careful navigation before proceeding further to the left.\n\nConsidering the mechanics, since the avatar needs to rotate to face left and reevaluate after that, my immediate action will be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action prepares us for subsequent movements toward the goal while keeping in mind the wall's limitation. After this action, I expect to reassess the movement possibilities without immediate hazards blocking the way."

The current position is surrounded by walls, which means I can't go up. Similarly, I can't move left or right due to the walls.\n2.
