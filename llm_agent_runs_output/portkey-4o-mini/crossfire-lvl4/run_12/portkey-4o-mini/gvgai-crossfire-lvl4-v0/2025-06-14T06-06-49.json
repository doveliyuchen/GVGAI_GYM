The surrounding structures include walls, turrets, and bombs that create hazards. \n\n### Analysis of the Game State:\n- There are turrets nearby (specifically at positions (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 24), (4, 25), (5, 15), (5, 16), (5, 19), (5, 20), etc.), which could fire bombs at you.\n- There are bombs located at various positions nearby, and colliding with them would result in a score decrease. You also have walls that you can use for protection.\n- The goal is to reach the objectives while avoiding damage and maximizing your score. \n\n### Current Strategy Considerations:\n1. **Avoid Moving Towards Turrets:** Moving into paths where turrets can target you is dangerous. \n2. **Plan Moving Directions:** Since your avatar hasn\u2019t moved this turn, the next action must be a moving command.\n3. **Prioritize Safety:** Move towards open space while still trying to progress toward a goal as effectively as possible.\n\n### Deciding on an Action:\nThe safest course would be to move into free space where there\u2019s no imminent threat from turrets, especially since there are no goals directly adjacent to you either. In your current position (13, 8), the best option would be to move either left (to (13, 7)) or down (to (14, 8)).\n\n**After calculating potential movements:**\n1. Moving **down** (to (14, 8)) moves closer towards the unexplored area and opens more potential paths.\n  \nThus, I will proceed with the action to move down:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move allows for exploration of a safer area while avoiding immediate danger from both bombs and turrets, aligning well with the strategic approach."
