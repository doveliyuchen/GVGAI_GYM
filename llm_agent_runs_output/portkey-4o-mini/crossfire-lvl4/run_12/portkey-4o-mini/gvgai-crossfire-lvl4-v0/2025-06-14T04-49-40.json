Directly moving up to (12, 3) from (13, 3) is clear based on the map; however, moving UP to (12, 3) will mean approaching the goal in the next move since the goal is only 2 rows above.\n  \n- There are no immediate bomb threats at the next two upward steps, as there are no bombs in a position to hit the avatar when moving up.\n\n### Considering the Strategy:\nThe strategy suggests proactive movement toward the goal while avoiding turrets and bombs. Given that the next action has been determined to be moving towards the goal without touching any obstacles or being under threat from turrets/bombs, the optimal direction for the avatar is UP.\n\n### Planned Action:\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar upward towards the goal, maintaining the strategy of minimizing risks and advancing towards the objective.

Here\u2019s a summary of nearby threats and movements:\n\n- **Immediate Threats:** There are turrets in both row 3 and row 4 that could pose a danger. The closest turret (at row 3, column 8) is directly to the right.\n- **Walls:** The walls surrounding my current position (row 13) provide some cover. To the left (column 2), it is open, while moving upward is blocked at row 12.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Since I can't move left (due to walls), and moving upward would also result in a wall collision, the direction of movement needs to be carefully chosen to avoid the defensive gunfire from the turrets as well.\n\nBased on this analysis, the safest action would be to move **downward** to row 14, which is entirely clear with no immediate threats and allows for potential movement options in the next turn. \n\nTherefore, I will proceed with:\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis action should provide a safe position to analyze further moves while maintaining my avatar's readiness to navigate towards the goal without immediate hindrance."

The straightforward path would be to move up twice directly because there is a wall above at (12, 4) and then left to (11, 3) for the goal.\n- However, moving vertically might expose the avatar to turret fire. Therefore, I must consider a safer route to avoid getting hit by bombs.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n- Since the goal is to head to (11, 3) and considering the immediate positions:\n  - Move **up** to (12, 4) first. This doesn't seem to expose the avatar immediately to turrets, as it's a wall above and no direct line of fire known.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nExecuting this action should ideally place the avatar one step closer to the goal while analyzing the turret movements simultaneously.

The strategy suggests that if the avatar hasn\u2019t moved from its last known state, the next step should involve either further movement or a change in strategy.\n\nSince the immediate goal is to avoid turrets while simultaneously looking for an escape path to the goal (located at (11, 3)), a preferable option might be to attempt to move upwards toward (12, 2), but a diagonal escape might tend towards avoidance of turrets. Instead of any such move that could favor walls leading the avatar towards potential risks, reverting to a different and potentially safer trajectory would be pivotal.\n\nGiven the situation and considering multiple conditions of the turrets (standing between the avatar and the goal) influencing both horizontal and vertical movement, we need to employ the safest alternative without collision from the bullets towards reaching the green door.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is chosen as a strategic retreat given the state observation, and I expect to relocate objectively while minimizing exposure to turret threats."

The area above the avatar has walls that are immediately reachable but will halt upward movement.\n\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   - Since the avatar is stuck and cannot move up or down, I will need to check my available options to ensure movement.\n\nSince there's no other alternative without hitting walls, I will opt to move `ACTION_LEFT` (2 columns to the left). This does not lead to reaching the goal or approaching turrets directly; it just moves left.\n\n### Selected Action\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action attempts to shift the avatar position left since moving up or down is not permissible. My expectation is to find a more strategic path to reach the goal while assessing potential risks from bomb turrets in subsequent moves."

Therefore, I will first evaluate moving left to (13, 3) since it should help me evade the threat while possibly allowing access upwards afterward.\n\n3. **Final Decision**: After that, I can reassess my next move, but initially, I'll move left to avoid any turret shots.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I will execute the following action:\n\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this move to put me in a safer position, from which I can then navigate towards the goal while avoiding turret fire."
