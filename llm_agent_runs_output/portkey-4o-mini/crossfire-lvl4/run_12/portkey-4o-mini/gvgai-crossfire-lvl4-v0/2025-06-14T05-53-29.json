However, moving up is not possible due to a wall directly above the avatar. We need to explore potential movements that will allow us to maneuver towards the goal effectively.\n\n### Analysis of Available Actions:\n- **Action Left (to (13, 2))**: Will move the avatar closer to the edge of the non-wall space but doesn\u2019t contribute toward reaching the goal directly.\n- **Action Right (to (13, 4))**: This will also move away from being directly under the goal but opens up additional paths to explore after.\n\nSince the ultimate strategy involves navigating closer to our goal, the action that allows for subsequent maneuverability seems preferable. In this case, both left and right actions are valid, but the growth of future options matters if my avatar ends up in a space with more adjacent exit options.\n\nThe strategy indicates that if the avatar does not move after an action, you should change the action.

Both movements seem strategic but moving up could be more direct toward reaching the goal.\n\n### Decision\nI will choose to move **UP** to (12, 7) since this aligns with my objective of progressing toward the exit while avoiding areas that contain hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to help me progress towards the exit without immediate threats around me."
