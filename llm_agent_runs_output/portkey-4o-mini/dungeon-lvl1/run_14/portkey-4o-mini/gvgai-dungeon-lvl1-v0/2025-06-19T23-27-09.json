The immediate goal is to collect resources (gold and the key) and navigate toward the exit, which is located at (18, 18).\n\n### Analysis of the Situation:\n1. The surrounding area around my avatar:\n   - To the left (10, 10) is a wall ('w').\n   - To the right (10, 12) is a wall ('w').\n   - Down (11, 11) is a lock ('l') which requires a key.\n   - Up (9, 11) is an open space ('.'), which I can traverse.\n\n2. Essential Items:\n   - There is a key at (19, 16). \n   - There are several gold pieces available in the area, particularly at (5, 4), (2, 10), (2, 11), and (2, 17).\n\n3. Hazards:\n   - A firehole (%), boulders, and ground traps are present in the vicinity.\n   - The immediate concern is to avoid hazards while I try to access the key and then open the lock.\n\n### Next Steps to Act:\nSince I cannot move down to access the lock from my current position and I need to change my position to make meaningful progress in the level, the best immediate action is to move up to (9, 11).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action will help reposition my avatar toward an open space, enabling me to reevaluate paths toward both the key and the exit in subsequent moves."

There is gold at positions (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 17), and others, as well as a lock at (11, 10), a key at (19, 16), and fireholes at (4, 10) and (6, 11).\n\nLet's break down the strategy based on the available positions:\n\n1. **Goal**: Reach the exit (`$`) at (18, 18).\n2. **Resources**: The avatar can collect gold and potentially the key.\n3. **Hazards**: Avoid fireholes, which can damage health. The lock requires the key to proceed.\n\n### Current Available Actions:\n- The immediate options for movement are to move left, right, up, or down. \n\nHere\u2019s the layout around the avatar (10, 9):\n- (10, 8) -> `.`\n- (10, 10) -> `.`\n- (11, 9) -> `w` (wall)\n- (9, 9) -> `.`\n\nMoving left (10, 8) or right (10, 10) are valid options as both squares are clear (`.`). Moving up (9, 9) is also an option, while moving down (11, 9) would encounter a wall.\n\nConsidering the strategy provided to prioritize resource collection, I will move to collect gold at (2, 10) which is directly above by moving up multiple times.\n\nMoving up to (9, 9) should position for potentially moving up further to (8, 9) next. \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action intends to shift upward to navigate towards areas where gold is readily available while avoiding hazards. Expectation is to position closer to collect gold or find pathways that lead to obtaining it without damaging the avatar."
