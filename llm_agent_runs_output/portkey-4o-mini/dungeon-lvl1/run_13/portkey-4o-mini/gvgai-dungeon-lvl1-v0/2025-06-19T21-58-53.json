The pathway towards it is currently clear of hazards.\n2. **Consider Health Management**: Collect resources before advancing too far into unknown territory where hazards might be present.\n3. **Collect Gold**: The gold tiles at subsequent rows need to be collected after reaching the key. \n\n### Next Action:\n\nTo move towards collecting the key at (5, 16), I will take the action: moving downwards to position (3, 4), because moving from (2, 4) to (3, 4) will get me closer to the key while avoiding immediate hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action will maintain progression towards valuable resources (the key) and does not risk contact with hazards.
