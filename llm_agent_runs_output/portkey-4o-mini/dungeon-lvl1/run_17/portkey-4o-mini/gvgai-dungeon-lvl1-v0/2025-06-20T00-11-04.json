Currently, my avatar ('a') is positioned at (9, 10). \n\nGiven the layout of the map:\n- There are several gold ('&') and a key ('*') nearby but also hazards like fire ('%') and traps ('v').\n- The nearest gold (at (2, 10), (2, 11), and (4, 12) which may be valuable for achieving a high score) and a key (at (5, 16)) are available.\n- There is an exit ('$') located at (18, 18), which is my ultimate goal.\n\nA strategic approach is to navigate towards these collectibles while avoiding hazards. Since I have not moved yet, I'll make sure to advance towards the nearest collectible (gold at (2, 10)) in the next step.\n\nConsidering the possible actions, the available movements from my position are:\n1. Up (to (8, 10) - which is empty)\n2. Down (to (10, 10) - which is wall)\n3. Left (to (9, 9) - which is empty)\n4.

The avatar can also seek the exit at (18, 18), but it must be cautious of traps and hazards along the way.\n3. The path for the avatar is relatively clear to the right (to (10, 11)), so moving in this direction can help explore potential resource-rich areas.\n\nRecognizing the avatar has not moved and there may be a rotation towards right, I will take the action to move right again. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is intended to guide the avatar towards the right, helping in resource collection while maintaining a strategic approach towards the exit."

Collect gold and the key to increase score and resources for navigating the level.\n2. Reach the exit while avoiding traps and hazards.\n\n### Plan of Action\n- The avatar's current position is critical. So we must decide on the next move after considering the last action.\n- Since there is no immediate action taken (as the position was just stated), we should plan to move towards the collectible gold nearby.\n  \n**Next Steps:**\n- The gold at (2, 10) and (2, 11) is quite far and not immediately accessible from the current position.\n- There is also a key at (5, 16) that is reachable.\n- It is better to move **down (ACTION_DOWN)** to explore further and hopefully find a viable strategy toward the exit.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down will help navigate to the next row for additional exploration, potentially towards more resources or discovering paths to the exit."

Move up to an empty floor.\n2. Move down to the lock, which requires a key for interaction.\n3. Move left to an empty floor.\n4. Move right to an empty floor.\n\n### Strategy Alignment\n1. **Resource Management**: The key (k) is in the direction of down (11,10). Since we want to open the locked door, obtaining the key is essential.\n2. **Avoiding Hazards**: No immediate hazards are present adjacent to the avatar.\n3. **Map Awareness**: The exit (denoted by '$') is located at (18,18), and we need to strategize our movements toward it while managing our resources.\n\n### Next Action\nSince my primary aim is to interact with the key (though there is a lock below), I should move down to the locked location since it will keep options open for further exploration once I gather more resources including the key.\n\n```Action: 3```\n\nFeedback: Moving down to the lock allows for future strategic options, as it requires my key to interact, thus aligning with the goal of preparing for further progress in the game."
