Moving left is not possible since there is a wall.\n\n**Key Points for Decision Making:**\n- Moving into an empty tile is a safe move.\n- The next objective based on the game mechanics is to transform boxes into open boxes for points, but there are no boxes adjacent to the current position.\n\nBased on the options:\n1. **Moving Right (to (7, 2))** - This would position myself closer towards the center where there could be further strategies available.\n2. **Moving Up (to (6, 1))** - This continues to open up the path and potentially could lead toward the top areas where there might be more boxes or safes.\n3. **Moving Down (to (8, 1))** - This may also be reasonable, keeping the potential avenues open for upcoming actions.\n\nGiven the current dynamic and trying to assess the potential for further advantageous movements, I will proceed with moving **Right (to (7, 2))** as it keeps immediate options open for either finding more boxes or moving towards a safe.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right should help further explore the area and assess the next steps towards maximizing points and avoiding threats effectively."
