The avatar must be cautious and avoid moving towards any thieves or monsters.\n\nGiven the current position of the avatar and the available boxes, let's consider the next action. According to the strategy provided, I'll evaluate the potential action based on the position of the avatar.\n\nAs it stands:\n- The avatar can interact with the box at (12, 10) directly by moving right.\n- Moving to the right should help in quickly collecting a box without hindrance from any enemies.\n\n### Planned Action\nLet's move the avatar right towards the box (12, 10):\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to collect a box and adds points while maintaining safety from the nearby monsters and thieves."
