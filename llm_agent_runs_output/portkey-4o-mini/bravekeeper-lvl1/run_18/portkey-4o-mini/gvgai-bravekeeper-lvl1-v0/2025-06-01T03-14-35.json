The surrounding area includes a number of interactive boxes '@' that are located at positions (row 12, column 10), (row 12, column 16), and (row 12, column 24).\n\n### Immediate Considerations:\n1. **Moving Safely**: Since there are threats in the form of monsters at positions (row 12, column 1) and (row 13, column 1), moving towards those boxes will pose a risk. Therefore, heading down to transform a box may not be the safest option unless carefully timed.\n2. **Exploring Alternative Paths**: I need to evaluate if there's a safe way to approach the boxes or if I should consider moving elsewhere temporarily to avoid immediate threats.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Since the avatar's position hasn't changed yet, the next logical step would be to rotate and reassess or attempt to move down (the action that keeps options available to access boxes that are below while also adjusting to threats).\n\nI will move **DOWN** toward row 11, column 2.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action positions the avatar closer to the potential boxes while allowing for adjustments based on the state so I can avoid the quick monsters. I expect this aligns with the strategy of avoiding immediate threats while positioning to collect points from boxes soon."
