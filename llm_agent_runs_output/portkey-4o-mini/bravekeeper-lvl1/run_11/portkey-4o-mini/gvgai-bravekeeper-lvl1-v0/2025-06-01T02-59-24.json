This means that moving left would result in being caught.\n2. **Box Proximity**: There appear to be open spaces to the south (down) and possibly east (right).\n3. **Objective Management**: Your goal is to avoid running into enemies while collecting boxes and ensuring there's no timeout.\n\nSince moving left is not a viable option due to the adjacent monsterQuick, I will move down (to (8, 5)). This keeps the avatar safe and potentially opens more navigation options. \n\nThus, the action I will take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to help avoid immediate danger and explore further options for collecting boxes."
