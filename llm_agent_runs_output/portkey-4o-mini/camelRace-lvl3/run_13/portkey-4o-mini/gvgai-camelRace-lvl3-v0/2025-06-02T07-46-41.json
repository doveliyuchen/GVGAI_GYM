The potential movements must avoid backtracking, as these would not align with the need for constant forward progression towards the goal.\n\n### Decision\nCurrently, the avatar's previous position is not explicitly stated, but if it's inside the area with the camels, the strategic move would be to go upward towards the goal, if it aligned with previous valid positions.\n\nAssuming the avatar is near the lower rows with access to move upward towards the goal without walls blocking the path directly, the action that corresponds to this strategy would be:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis expects the avatar to move upwards to approach the goal while avoiding collisions with walls, helping to secure a winning state before any camel can reach the goal."

The avatar must navigate through the walls and avoid being blocked by the camels.\n\n3. **Current Goals**:\n   - Ensure that the avatar reaches the goal (1, 46).\n   - Avoid getting blocked by any camels reaching that same goal first.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven the complexity of navigating through numerous walls and possible interactions with camels, I will assume that the avatar is in a safe position (e.g., row 4, col 5) and I will choose an action to move up towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is to move closer to the goal while keeping an eye on the camels' movements and ensuring the avatar avoids walls.

The avatar 'a' isn't explicitly located in the current state representation, but we can observe that there are multiple camels '@' scattered across the map towards the right half, primarily in rows 2 to 5.\n2. The goal '#' is located at (1, 46), while some walls '%' block the path on rows 1 and 3.\n3. The walls restrict movement, which requires that the avatar navigate carefully to reach the goal before any camel reaches it.\n\n### Positioning Analysis\n- The avatar's exact position hasn't been provided; thus, I will assume the player has just performed an action that didn't change the position (as stated in the mechanics).\n- The objective is to reach (1, 46) before any camels do, ideally without colliding with walls.\n\n### Strategy Application\nFrom the mentioned strategies, here's what we can derive:\n1. **Path Planning**: To effectively reach the goal, let's move horizontally close to row 1, rather than row 2 or 3, since row 1 leads directly to the goal.\n2. **Timing and Positioning**: It would be logical to move right towards column 46, while also being aware of the camels' positions to avoid a loss by unintentionally letting a camel reach the goal.\n3. **Obstacle Navigation**: If the avatar is blocked by walls, it may need to take a few steps back and make alternate moves until it finds a clear path.\n4. **Adaptability**: Given no current movement has occurred, I will attempt to make a move that could potentially change my stance based on the camel positions.\n\n### Action Selection\nAs an effective strategy:\n- If the avatar has the potential to move up or down towards a less obstructed path while making rightward progress towards the goal, the movement will be considered.\n\n### Conclusion\nConsidering the focus on maximizing forward movement while keeping an eye on potential obstacles and camel positioning, I will move the avatar **right**.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right is a step towards the goal and will be a meaningful action to ensure we make progress towards winning."

The goal is to reach it before the camels do.\n\nCurrently, our avatar is positioned at (5, 7) and can attempt to move in a direction.
