The goal is located at (1, 46) and has a series of walls around it.\n\n3. **Goals and Camels**: The goal (green door '#') is located at (2, 46). The player must reach this goal before any camels do. It appears that multiple camels (@) are closer to the goal compared to where the avatar might be.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Potential Move Paths**:\n   - The goal is at row 2, column 46. My avatar needs to navigate through the walls and reach there before any camels.\n   - Moving in the vicinity of the green door is crucial as that is the primary goal. I need to ensure I have a clear pathway without being blocked by walls or camels.\n   - Keeping track of the camels' positions is vital since they are faster and can move to the goal quickly.\n\n5. **Movement Strategy**:\n   - Depending on the current position of the avatar, I need to take an immediate action towards clearing a path towards reaching the desired goal.\n   - Avoid walls and ensure the direction taken allows for one possible move towards the goal in future turns.\n\n### Decision:\nBefore concluding the action to take, it is important to determine if the avatar indeed has walls obstructing its path, and if it's possible to move directly towards the goal.\n\nGiven the current positioning of walls and the proximity of the camels, I will attempt to take an action optimizing movement towards where I believe the avatar's pathway naturally leads to the goal and hopefully has some clear path based on my analysis.\n\nIf I need to adjust my position or if I remain still after executing an action, I would choose direction that draws me closer to the exit or influences a future movement away from the immediate threat posed by the camels.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move UP if the avatar is not currently blocked above. \n\n```Action: 4```\n\nThis action is intended to provide a path upward, possibly revealing more clear routes to access the goal without interference from walls.

Therefore, the priority should be on efficiently navigating toward the goal while keeping an eye on the camels' movements.\n\n### Current State Actions\nThe avatar has not moved yet in this scenario, so let's analyze possible actions:\n\n1. **Movement Direction**: Moving right from the position of the avatar would bring it closer to the goal (1, 46) since there are no walls in that vicinity. The quickest route appears to be generally rightward.\n\nSince the avatar is likely at one of the lower rows and wanting to reach the higher rows, the following direction should be prioritized:\n- **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move right towards the goal.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nI expect that this action will allow the avatar to cover horizontal distance toward the goal while potentially avoiding the camels.
