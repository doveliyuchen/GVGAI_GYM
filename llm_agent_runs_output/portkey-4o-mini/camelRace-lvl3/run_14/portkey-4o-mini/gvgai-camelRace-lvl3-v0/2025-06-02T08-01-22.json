The camels at row 2 and 3 are partially obstructing a clear path from the avatar to the goal, but they don't directly block the avatar's current position.\n\n### Strategy Implementation\n1. **Movement Awareness**: As per the rules, it is essential to reassess if the avatar can move effectively at each action. Since this is the first action based on a clear state, I will prioritize moving either left or downwards towards open spaces while avoiding immediate confrontation with camels.\n2. **Path Planning**: Moving either left into row 7, column 6 or down to row 8, column 7 provides more flexibility.\n3. **Using Obstacles**: The walls (represented by `%`) are protective barriers that the camels must navigate around; I can use these structures to my advantage while progressing to the goal.\n\nGiven the analysis and current state, I will opt to take the action of moving left to row 7, column 6 to ensure I don't face the camels immediately.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action aims to reposition toward safer areas, creating more options to evade the camels while still making progress towards the goal. My expectation is that this movement will lead to better positioning in the following turns."

The optimal decision could be to move **up** to (row=3, col=7) since it keeps the avatar's vertical distance from the camels to maximize the distance from them horizontally, as camels are present below at (row=4, col=7).

The camels are also positioned on the path towards the goal, indicating potential dangers as they could reach the goal before you.\n\n2. **Movement Considerations**: Currently, your avatar needs to either go left or right to avoid the camels while also finding a possible route towards the goal. Moving vertically downwards (ACTION_DOWN) would keep you in a row surrounded by walls, so it might not be beneficial.\n\n3. **Immediate Actions**: Since the priority is moving towards the goal and avoiding the camels, moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) to (row=5, col=8) seems to be the best choice currently as it leads to an open space.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is expected to move the avatar one step right, providing a clearer pathway and helping you evade the camels while continuing to push towards the goal. Let's see if we can maintain the advantage and align our strategy with this move."

However, this does not progress towards the goal directly.\n2. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Move to row 5, column 7 or 8. This still doesn\u2019t progress towards the goal directly.\n3. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Move to row 4, column 6 or 7. This would also not progress towards the goal.\n4. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Move to row 4, column 8, which might be redundant since both columns 7 and 8 already occupy the avatar.\n\nSince the goal is to reach (1, 46), moving vertically to row 3 and then attempting to navigate right might be a more effective strategy. \n\nGiven that the avatar has not moved in the last action, I should choose **ACTION_DOWN (3)** to progress downward toward a more favorable outcome next round.\n\nThus, my final action will be: \n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nBy moving down, I'll be able to assess further options in the following turn.

Since it seems that there are walls (`%`) surrounding areas around my avatar, I need to carefully plan my moves to avoid the camels while heading towards the goal.\n\nGiven my avatar's current position is at row 4, col 7. I have options to move:\n\n- **Left to (4, 6)**, **Down to (5, 7)**, **Right to (4, 8)** or **Up to (3, 7)**.\n\nTo take the shortest path towards the goal (1, 46), I should aim to minimize obstacles and increase distance between my avatar and the camels. \n\nI will choose to move `RIGHT` to (4, 8), as this opens up pathways and will allow me to reassess my position towards the goal, while maintaining awareness of the camels' positions.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action keeps me on track towards the goal, and I expect to see an opening towards advancing further, while evaluating the positions of the camels on my next turn."

The walls (`%`) are present which can block both camels and the avatar's movement. The camels (`@`) are present at multiple positions, and they need to be avoided to secure the win.\n\nGiven the context and with no initial avatar position stated:\n\n- **Action Strategy**: It is necessary to choose a movement action that leads us toward the goal while avoiding immediate hazards from camels.\n\nSince I don't have an avatar position, I will choose to move down in anticipation of reaching the rows that contain more open opportunities to maneuver towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows me to explore the map further, potentially bringing me closer to open spaces or paths that can lead me towards the goal efficiently."

Since the last interaction has not changed the avatar's position, we need to reassess and change our action. \n\n**Next Action Decision**:\nThe camels are located in the same row and seem to be lined up in columns towards the right. The most strategic action now would be to move the avatar to the right, potentially creating distance from the camel threats while progressing towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nBy moving right, I expect to maintain a safe distance from the camels and continue making progress toward the goal."
