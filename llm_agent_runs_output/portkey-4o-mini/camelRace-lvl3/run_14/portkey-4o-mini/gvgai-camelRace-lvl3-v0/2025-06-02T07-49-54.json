Moving to the right (ACTION_RIGHT) might risk not succeeding if a camel moves in the same row to the goal.\n2. **Optimal Action:** Since the avatar should get closer to the goal and avoid being blocked or hindered by the camels, moving right to explore more options appears essential.\n\nGiven the information and the current position, I plan to move to the right to begin moving towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aligns with the strategy of advancing towards the goal while maintaining awareness of camel positions.

The goal is positioned far to the right, but it is accessible. Direct movement toward the right will be necessary to reach it effectively.\n\n3. There are several walls present (`%`) that may restrict movement if encountered, thus I need to maneuver carefully while heading towards the goal to avoid being blocked.\n\nSince I need to choose a meaningful action toward the win and adapt my position accordingly, I will perform the action to move towards the right, which is currently the goal direction.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should help me progress toward the goal, and I expect to be able to continue moving unless blocked by an obstacle."
