Utilize the walls to block camel paths and plan movements carefully.\n\n### Next Steps\nBased on the provided strategy, I will:\n- Quickly assess the route towards the goal.\n- Identify if the camels are moving toward the goal and establish the safest point to advance.\n\nGiven that I cannot move through walls and the proximity of camels could put me at risk, I will first aim to move away from any potential intersection with camels to re-evaluate the path toward the goal.\n\n### Choosing the Action\nSince there is no direct block between the avatar and the goal, I will go ahead and move up (`ACTION_UP`), which corresponds to `4`. \n\nThis will allow me to get closer to the goal while observing the positions of the camels and reassessing my strategy as I get closer.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is expected to bring the avatar closer to an optimal position for pursuing the goal without immediate interference from camels."

    "content": "Since the current state doesn't specify the exact position of my avatar (`a`), I will assume it has not been updated in the visible state and is somewhere in the portion of the map where movement strategies would be applicable. \n\nThe goal (`#`) is located at row 1, column 46 and requires strategic routing to reach it before any camels (`@`) do. \n\nGiven the map overview, it appears that I need to navigate the walls (`%`) to approach the goal and remain vigilant for incoming camels. The provided strategy emphasizes planning my path and timing my approach based on the movement of camels.\n\nI will analyze my immediate surroundings for walls or camels blocking the path towards the goal. Based on the knowledge that I've not moved yet, I'll attempt to seek a clear path.\n\n### Action Decision\nThe immediate objective is to either move towards the goal directly (if possible) or navigate around walls to get to a more favorable space.\n\nGiven that my next course of action seems pivotal, especially if the last state did not change my position, I will act based on the proximity to walls. If I can move UP, this might allow for a better position or setup towards the goal.\n\nI will choose: \n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action represents moving DOWN, as it may help adjust my avatar towards an open space, avoiding immediate hazards while keeping the goal in mind. \nI expect that this may place me in a more favorable position for subsequent moves."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game where the avatar is surrounded by walls, I need to evaluate the situation carefully. The game involves reaching the green goal door (the '#' at coordinates (1, 46)) before a camel (the '@' symbols) does. My avatar appears to be at position (3, 47) at the bottom right corner of the map. \n\n### Current Observations:\n- The nearest goal is two moves away, but I have to ensure that no camel reaches it first.\n- There are multiple camels below my avatar, right at (2, 29) and (2, 30), and also at (3, 29) and (3, 30), which could potentially move toward the goal.\n- The wall above and below my current row creates barriers that I can leverage to protect my path.\n\n### Given Strategy to Apply:\n1. **Plan Your Path:** The goal is visible and I need direct access to move upwards.\n2. **Observe Camel Movements:** Timing is crucial. Since camels are active and their movements can intersect with my path, I need to proceed with caution.\n3. **Use Walls to Your Advantage:** The walls above and below can shield me from quick access by camels.\n4. **Timing Your Approach:** I will need to wait for the right moment when the path is clear before approaching.\n5. **Act Based on Movements:** Given the camels' potential paths, I must ensure that I take actions that allow movement towards the goal while remaining aware of camel positions.\n\n### Next Steps:\nNext, I will choose an action that rotates me up to have an initial upward move towards the goal, which may help in gauging the movement of the camels since I cannot move through walls.\n\n**Choosing Action:** \n1. It\u2019s essential to rotate towards the goal first if I cannot make a valid upward move yet, so I will select `ACTION_UP`. \n2. If there is no wall above, I\u2019ll position myself to start moving toward the goal while checking for movement patterns of the camels.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action allows me to assess the situation while preparing for a forthcoming strategy based on the camels' placement and the goal's access."

The goal is located at (row 1, col 46) and there are multiple camels (represented by '@') positioned at various locations on the map, particularly on row 2 and 3 at columns 29 and 30, and on rows below as well.\n\n### Analyzing the Situation:\n- The goal is **far to the right**, on row 1, and my avatar is blocked by walls towards the left side, making the direct path to the goal potentially obstructed by camels as well.\n- Immediate adjacent cells to my avatar position (row 6, col 7) include empty spaces (both row 6 and row 7 contain dots).\n- **Camels** at (row 2, col 29) and (row 3, col 29/30) are relatively close to the goal. \n\n### Proposed Action:\nSince the avatar's position does not change after any actions unless walls are absent, I can move further right. \n\nI will execute: ``` Action: 2 ``` (ACTION_RIGHT).\n\nThis action allows me to move towards spaces that could lead me closer to the goal while staying clear of immediate dangers posed by the camels, as it aligns with the strategy of planning a path to the goal while observing camel movements."
