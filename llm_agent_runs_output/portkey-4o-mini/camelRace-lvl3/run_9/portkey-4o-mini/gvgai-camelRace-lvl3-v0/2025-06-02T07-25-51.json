Therefore, we need to assume the last known position of the avatar or determine it based on common strategic starting locations, usually in the lower half near the goal.\n\n### Observations\n1. **Goal Position**: The goal, represented by '#', is located at (1, 46) and (2, 46).\n2. **Walls**: There are walls '%' scattered throughout the maze which will block movement.\n3. **NPCs (Camels)**: The camels ('@') are present in multiple positions, and their movements will need to be considered to avoid collision and prevent them from reaching the goal first.\n\n### Strategy\n- The avatar must be positioned to make progress toward the goal while avoiding walls and anticipating camel movements.\n- The objective is to reach the goal before the camels do, which means careful navigation is crucial.\n\n### Analysis\nSince the avatar position is not explicitly given in the last state, we might have recent knowledge of its potential location. Assuming a position near the starting area (say row 4 to row 7, as they hold camels where the avatar might start), we determine the best action to move toward the goal.\n\n### Actions\nConsidering that the goal is at (1, 46), and to reach it, navigating through the lower row areas while avoiding walls is essential. The camels' proximity needs to be avoided as they are moving toward the goal.\n\n1.

Given that there are several rows of scattered dots (representing open spaces) and obstacles, the key pieces of information are:\n- The goal (#) is at (1, 46).\n- Several camels (@) are located in different rows, most notably at (2, 29), (2, 30), (3, 29), and (3, 30), indicating potential competition for reaching the goal.\n\n### Walls and Movement\nThe avatar must navigate a maze with walls (%) blocking potential paths. \n\n### Previous Strategy Reminder\nBased on the strategies outlined:\n1. **Navigation**: Avoid walls and plan the most efficient route to the goal (1, 46).\n2. **Avoid Camels**: Prevent direct confrontation with camels, especially since they move towards the goal as well.\n3. **Optimize Route**: Identify open spaces towards the goal while considering camel movements.\n\n### Avatar Position Analysis\nSince the avatar position isn't available, I'll proceed with a default assumption that the player is currently located at an open space ('.') and consider the movement options. If positioned adjacent to walls, I will aim to get as close as possible to the goal while avoiding camels' immediate paths.\n\n### Possible Actions\nThe available actions are:\n- **Left (1)**\n- **Right (2)**\n- **Down (3)**\n- **Up (4)**\n- **NIL (0): No Action**\n\nIt would be prudent for the avatar to move right towards (1, 46) to get closer to the goal. Because multiple camels are already in the vicinity, I will also aim to take action that allows for potential avoidance of incoming camels while moving towards the goal.\n\nGiven the mapping suggest that a movement right is possible without hitting any walls, I will select that action.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action should help the avatar make progress towards the goal, while optimally avoiding camels. I expect to see the avatar moving closer to the goal without significant hindrance from obstacles or competitors."

From the map, there seem to be ample spaces ('.') available which should allow for movement.\n\n### Analyzing Directions\n1. Moving **LEFT** (1) may take the avatar only into walls or positions that do not benefit progressing towards the goal.\n2. Moving **RIGHT** (2) seems like a solid option, providing a pathway while potentially moving closer to the goal.\n3. Moving **DOWN** (3) could lead towards rows with more empty spaces.\n4. Moving **UP** (4) may not yield a significant advantage unless there\u2019s a clear indication of walls blocking.\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven this analysis, my action will be to move right towards the goal. The strategy remains to head towards the goal while observing and avoiding the camels.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action should bring the avatar closer to the goal, if possible, aligning with the strategy of reaching the destination before the camels.
