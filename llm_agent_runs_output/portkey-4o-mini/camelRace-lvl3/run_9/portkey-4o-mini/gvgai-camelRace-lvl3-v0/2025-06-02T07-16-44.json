I will initiate an action to explore movement which usually is in line with heading towards the right (denoted at column `46` with goal).\n\nSetting the action to:\n``` Action: 2 ```\nI expect this to align with moving toward the goal while assessing if subsequent actions might be necessary given the potential danger presented by camels along the path."

Observing the walls can be a better strategic option.\n\nI will move **Up** to (2, 46) to realign for approaching the goal while distanced from immediate camel threats.

Since they move towards the player rapidly, caution is required when planning next moves.\n\n### Strategy Reminder\n- **Timing and Path Planning**: Moving towards the goal while navigating away from enemies is crucial.\n- **Utilizing Corners and Walls**: I can use the walls to create barriers between myself and the camels, especially when making decisions to avoid collisions that would lead to losing the game.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nFrom the avatar's position (Row 7, Column 7), I need to strategize the next move. The goal is significantly to the left and up relative to my position. However, camels are also in proximity.\n\n1. **Moving Left** (ACTION_LEFT): This would result in the avatar facing the left direction, which is one move closer to the goal.\n\nGiven that I need to prioritize direction towards achieving the win rather than colliding with enemies, I will choose to move left.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI've chosen to move left to progress toward the goal while monitoring the camels\u2019 positions for any potential threats."

There's a wall ('%') blocking the direct path upward towards the goal.\n\nBased on the suggested strategy, I need to maintain awareness of the camels' positions and utilize the walls to navigate carefully. The closest path to the goal is upward, but there are walls on the way. I should move right first to create separation from the camels and plan subsequent actions based on their movement.\n\nSince the last position did not change, to ensure different movements from my previous actions, I will make the best strategic choice.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action moves me to the right.
