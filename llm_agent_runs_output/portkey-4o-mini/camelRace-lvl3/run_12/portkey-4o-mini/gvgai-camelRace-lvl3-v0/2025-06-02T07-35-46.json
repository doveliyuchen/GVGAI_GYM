The optimal movement is dependent on avoiding potential colliding paths with the camels.\n\nTo initiate movement towards a general area where my avatar might be positioned (presuming it's in close proximity to the goal), I will take the action to move **down**, as this keeps me on my path towards the goal if I am near it.

Move **Right** (ACTION_RIGHT) - We can attempt this; our current position seems free in that direction but might still be obstructed by walls or camels in the next row.\n2. Move **Up** (ACTION_UP) - This would help if we want to relocate to a less obstructed row, but we need to confirm the walls above and if we can go up without hitting a wall.\n3.
