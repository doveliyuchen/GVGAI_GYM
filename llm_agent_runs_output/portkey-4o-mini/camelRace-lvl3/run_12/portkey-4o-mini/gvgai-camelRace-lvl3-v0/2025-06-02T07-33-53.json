However, there are camels (@) present along with the goal (#) at (1, 46) and multiple walls (%).\n\n2. **Camels:** The layout shows groups of camels moving in specific blocks (with two appearing in each of the rows from 2 to 7, with some movements implied).

Players need to strategize to reach this position before any camels do, understanding the occupancy and potential movement disruptions from the walls.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nGiven the avatar's likely proximity to obstacles and camels, a cautious approach is necessary. Since the avatar is not specified, it is prudent to focus on checking potential actions that can yield results:\n\n- **Moving Down:** Since wall coverage dominates the upper rows, moving down might open pathways to navigate while avoiding camels.\n- **Staying Safe:** Maintaining a distance from camels while observing their movements is crucial will help in reassessing the position towards the goal.\n\n### Selected Action\nTo initiate navigation towards safer ground while observing patterns, I will begin with:\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nFeedback: Moving down could provide a clearer view of the environment and potential escape routes while further assessing camel movements.

Unfortunately, the avatar location isn't specified in the current state description, hence the analysis must assume the avatar can be in any of the empty spaces.\n\nBased on the goal's location, it is crucial that you navigate through the maze, especially since the camels (represented by '@') can block or reach the exit if they get there first, leading to a potential loss.\n\nThe immediate action should involve:\n1.
