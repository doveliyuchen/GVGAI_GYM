The avatar starts at `(1, 1)` and needs to reach the goal located at `(1, 46)`.\n2. Observations:\n   - The path to the goal consists mostly of open spaces represented by '.'.\n   - There are camels represented as '%' in the vicinity, which can potentially block the route or interfere with reaching the goal.\n3. There appear to be different speeds assigned to camels, but we do not currently observe their specific movement patterns in this state.\n4. The walls are represented by 'f', restricting movement.\n\nAs a first step, moving right into position `(1, 2)` will open up more navigation options without getting closer to any camels (since the closest one is at `(4, 2)`).\n\nThus, I'll choose to move right: \n\n``` Action:2 ```\n   \nThis action should make progress towards the goal while keeping options open for the next turns. The expected result is a shift from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`, allowing for more strategic movements moving forward."

    "content": "To determine the best action given the current state, let's first identify where the avatar ('a') is located and how to navigate towards the goal ('#'), while avoiding camels ('%') and walls ('f').\n\n### Current Analysis:\n- **Avatar Position**: Not explicitly listed, but it seems you might be referring to a general position near several enemy sprites.\n- **Goal Position**: The goal is located at (row 1, col 46).\n- **Obstacle**: Walls are located all around, and there are camels that can obstruct the path.\n\n### Immediate Plan:\n1. **Identify Path Options**: You need to first find a clear path from your current position towards the goal. Look for open spaces ('.') and avoid moving towards the camels.\n2. **Movement Strategy**: Use the direction that would lead closer to the goal while ensuring that you don't move into a wall or too close to a camel.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed yet, if you're not currently able to move towards the goal, consider turning and then moving.\n\nTo ensure both compliance with game mechanics and strategic positioning:\n- First, **rotate** towards the goal.\n- Then, make your move when clear.\n\nLet's assume you need to move right towards columns 46 first:\n\n```Action: 2``` \n\nThis action should rotate the avatar towards the right direction and I expect to see whether the movement is clear toward the goal in the subsequent state.

The path seems to be quite clear in the open spaces. \n\nTo formulate a plan based on the winning strategy:\n1. Move through available spaces toward the goal.\n2. Keep an eye on the camels\u2019 movements to avoid them blocking the route to the goal.\n\nSince I am going to take my first action after analyzing the state, and I believe the best initial move would be to traverse from the leftmost side toward the right to approach the goal.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is to move right towards the open areas.
