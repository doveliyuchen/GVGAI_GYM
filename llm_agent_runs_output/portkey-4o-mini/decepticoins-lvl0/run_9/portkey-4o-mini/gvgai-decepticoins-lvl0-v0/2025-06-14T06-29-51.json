The goal is to remove this box from the level.\n- **Holes ('0')**: There are two holes located at (5, 8) and (5, 10) where boxes can fall into.\n- **Coins ('#')**: There are several coins at (2, 11), (3, 1), (4, 11), (5, 11) that can be collected for scoring.\n- **Switches ('s')**: At (1, 1) and (1, 11), which could change the environment when activated.\n- **Walls ('w')**: Surrounding the playable area, creating boundaries.\n\n### Avatar's Current Situation:\n1.

The next reasonable action would be to explore the surroundings and interact with boxes or collect coins. \n\nSince the objective is to remove all boxes, the first step should be to move towards the box (5,9) at (5,9), which can be done by moving down to (5,1).\n\nThus, the action to take is:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action involves moving down, and I expect to advance towards the box to prepare for the next step in our strategy to remove it."

In your current setup, you can either move to the left or take other actions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Current Position**: (5, 11) - Your avatar is positioned near an empty space to the left where a box is located. \n2. **Box Location**: The box is at (5, 9), which is reachable by moving left.\n3. **Next Actions**: If you move left into the space at (5, 10), you will then be able to move that box further left into (5, 8), which is a hole (0), thereby removing the box from the level.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nI suggest moving left to position (5, 10), which will allow further interaction with the box on the next move.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will align with the strategy of moving boxes towards holes to clear the level. I expect that moving left will prepare for the next action of pushing the box into the hole."

There is also a hole (represented by '0') at (5, 8) to the left of the box. The goal is to remove all boxes from the level while avoiding any dangers such as the piranha (represented by 'e').\n\nIn this situation, it would be strategic to move the box to the left into the hole, which would remove the box from the level. \n\n### Actions:\n- The action to move the avatar left (to position (5, 9)) is necessary for pushing the box left into the hole. Thus, I will choose:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will examine the outcome of the current positioning and allow for the box to be moved. My expectation is to successfully remove the box by placing it into the hole, aligning with the strategy of using available boxes effectively."
