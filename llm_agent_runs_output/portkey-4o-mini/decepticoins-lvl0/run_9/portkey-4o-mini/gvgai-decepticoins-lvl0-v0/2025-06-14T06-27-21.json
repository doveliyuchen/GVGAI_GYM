The surrounding area consists of a mix of walls ('w'), empty spaces ('.'), and boxes ('@') with holes ('0') below the boxes. My priority should be to eliminate the box located at (5, 9).\n\nTo eliminate the box, I need to push it to an adjacent hole. However, to initiate this, I must first move the avatar.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nThe best move is to **push the box** at (5, 9). To do this, I should move my avatar to the left toward the box, so I will perform the action `ACTION_LEFT`.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow me to position the avatar directly next to the box, enabling the next move to push it into a hole. I expect to see the avatar at (5, 10), ready to move into (5, 9) next turn and push the box into the hole at (5, 8)."

The objective is to eliminate all the boxes.\n\nGiven that I can push the box to the left into the hole at `(5, 8)`, this would be the ideal action to eliminate the box. Since this is a crucial move, I should push left first, then confirm if the action changes my position or game state.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action should allow me to push the box into the hole and bring me closer to achieving my game objective of eliminating boxes while also managing the risk of piranhas."
